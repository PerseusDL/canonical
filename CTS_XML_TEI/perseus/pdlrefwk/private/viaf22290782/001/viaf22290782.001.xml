<p>Thirteen fragments, ten found on Akropolis and South
Slope. Twelve fragments now <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6595">EM 6595</rs> and set in relative
positions in plaster reconstruction (photo, <title>AJP</title> 88 [1967]
pl. 2): I (a + b, c), II (d, e + f + m), III (g + i + j + l, h).
Position of fragment K (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 2494">EM 2494</rs>) uncertain. Both edges
preserved. Fragment I b preserves part of left edge of relief
and inscription, otherwise broken all around. Relief separated from inscription by taenia and cyma reversa. Moulding and inscription extend 0.115 beyond edge of relief. Surface battered, corroded. White, medium-grained marble. Restored minimum dimensions of stele without relief:
h. 1.40, w. 0.592, th. 0.163. Relief: p.h. 0.13, p.w. 0.195, th.
0.115, relief h. very low, h. of letters 0.009.
</p>
<p>The stele records two decrees containing a number of
provisions for the collection and enforcement of the
tribute, with emphasis upon the personal responsibility of the local tribute collectors. It is assumed that these decrees are the result of provisions made in the second Methone decree (no. 2, lines 51-56), which is dated to the first prytany of <dateRange from="-426-07" to="-425-06">426/25</dateRange>. The stele was to have been set up on the Akropolis while Kekropis was in prytany (lines 24-25); Kekropis held the second prytany in <dateRange from="-426-07" to="-425-06">426/25</dateRange> (<bibl><title>IG</title> I<hi rend="sup">3</hi> 369</bibl>, line 6).</p>

<p>All that remains of the relief is a small fragment of
the lower left corner depicting containers, which must
represent the collected tribute. Standing at the left is
a hydria and above and behind it perhaps another.
Pots were convenient storage containers for coins;
the accounts of the treasury at Delos list stamnoi
containing money (F. Durrbach, <title>Inscriptions de Délos,
comptes des Hiéropes</title> [1929] no. 399 and 63), and
Raubitschek (<title>TAPA</title> 72 [1941] 356-62) has argued that
the tribute collected at the time of the City Dionysia
was displayed, one talent per hydria, in the theatre
(see also <bibl n="Isoc. 8.82">Isok. 8.82</bibl>). Next to the pots are a number of
bulging sacks tied at the top, which resemble those
on the nearly contemporary frieze of the Ilissos Temple (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1780">NM 1780</rs>: C. Picon, <title>AJA</title> 82  [1978]  51, fig. 1) and
must also represent tribute. There may originally have
been at least one figure, perhaps Athena, in the missing part of the relief.</p>

<p>Found in Theatre of Dionysos. Upper part of relief and
bottom of inscription broken, edges badly chipped. Surface
very worn, corroded, with several vertical cracks. Grey-white, medium-grained marble. p.h. of stele 1.00, p.w. of
stele 0.53 (top), 0.55 (bottom), th. 0.11, p.h. of relief 0.21,
relief h. 0.015, h. of letters 0.015 (lines 1-2), 0.01 (lines
3 ff.).
</p>

<p>The stele recorded at least four decrees concerning
Methone, an Eretrian colony on the Thermaic gulf,
probably a tributary ally of the Athenian empire by
this time, and favoured by Athens for its strategic
position in an area of Macedonian influence. Only
the first two decrees, setting forth financial and trading privileges and warning Perdikkas of Macedon of Athenian support for Methone, are well-preserved.
The decrees were not passed in the same year, and the
date of the first (between 430 and 426) in particular
is problematic, but the stele itself was carved in the
eighth prytany of <dateRange from="-424-07" to="-423-06">424/23</dateRange>, when Phainippos was secretary of Akamantis (Thuc. 4.118.11). He is named at the top of the inscription (line 2), in addition to the
secretaries of the first three decrees, and so must have
been the secretary of the last decree, which is lost
(<title>ATL</title> III, 133).
</p>

<p>The relief depicts Athena seated on a rock at the
far right, facing another figure in the centre of the
relief. She extends her right hand toward the somewhat smaller figure and rests her left elbow on part of
the rock (or once-painted shield?) behind her. She
wears a sleeved chiton, a mantle wrapped around her
lower body, and an aegis, its small gorgoneion barely
visible. Her head is almost entirely broken away. The
seated Athena is a popular type in late fifth- and early
fourth-century document reliefs (see nos. 11, 71, 72,
87, 90, 91). The other figure, whose upper half is
almost completely destroyed, wears a short, belted
chiton and extends her right hand toward Athena;
she is accompanied on the left by a dog, and there are
further unidentifiable traces of relief on the far left.
The dress of the figure, the dog, and the probability
of the figure's <term>dexiosis</term> with Athena make Artemis, a
major Eretrian deity, a likely symbol of her colony;
cf. <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1783 B">NM 1783 B</rs>, a late fifth-century votive relief dedicated to Hermes and the Nymphs with a similar figure of Artemis wearing a short chiton (Svoronos, pl. 28; Mitropoulou, <title>Corpus</title> I, fig. 186). The disparity in the
scale of the two figures, which has sometimes been
cited as an objection to this identification, is no more
than the conventional difference in size between standing and seated figures grouped together. The relief is very worn, but Athena's position and the prominent modelling lines across her legs bring to mind the
drapery of the seated Athena of the east frieze of the
Hephaisteion (<title>Hesperia</title> 31 [1962], pl. 77b, fig. 6;
Ridgway, fig. 50).

</head>

<p>Found in fortification wall near Greater Propylaia in Eleusis
in 1887. Back and top rough-picked, sides smooth, bottom
broken. Badly chipped taenia and cyma reversa above. Relief
bordered below by taenia with first line of inscription and
cyma reversa, together 0.09 wide. Surface uniformly weathered, with corrosion and red-brown iron stains. White,
medium-grained marble. p.h. of stele 0.90, w. 0.53 (relief
and inscription), 0.57 (top moulding), th. 0.10 (relief), 0.12
(inscription), relief h. 0.02, h. of letters 0.018.
</p>

<p>The decree, dated to the first prytany of <dateRange from="-422-07" to="-421-06">422/21</dateRange> by its
secretary Prepis (lines 1-4), provides for the construction of a stone footbridge over one of the Rheitoi, the
pair of lakes that stood at the border between Athens
and Eleusis, to be constructed from blocks taken from
the demolished Archaic Telesterion at Eleusis. The
bridge formed part of the Sacred Way taken by Athenians going to Eleusis for initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>
<p>The relief depicts Demeter, Kore, a young male
probably to be identified as Triptolemos, and Athena,
all standing on a ground line slightly raised above the
moulding. Athena stands on the right. She wears a
belted peplos, shoulder mantle, aegis with gorgoneion,
and an Attic helmet. Her left arm is raised high to
hold her spear, which was originally shown in paint.
She looks toward the smaller male figure, who wears
a himation. His left hand is raised with the fingers
turned inward as though holding a slender object.
His right hand crosses Athena's right hand but probably does not grasp it; the angle of their arms seems too low, the gesture too inconsequential for <term>dexiosis</term>. In age and gesture the youth resembles the male figure
in the Great Eleusinian Relief (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 126">NM 126</rs>: L. Schneider,
<title>AntP</title> 12 (1973) 103-22, pls. 31-41) and like him is
often identified as Triptolemos holding once-painted
stalks of grain. Triptolemos often appears with
Demeter and Kore in votive reliefs of this period and
is therefore a likely representative of their cult. Although he is almost always shown in his chariot (cf. no. 161), the stalks of grain would have been sufficient to identify him.
</p>

<p>Further left stand Demeter and Kore, to whom the
Rheitoi were said to be sacred (<bibl n="Paus. 1.38.1">Paus. 1.38.1</bibl>; Hesych.
s.v. <title>Rheitoi</title>). Kore carries one torch cradled in her
left arm and a second torch held upside down in her
extended right hand. She wears a peplos and a
himation. Demeter wears  a belted peplos with
unbelted overfall and a shoulder mantle, one end of
which she holds up in her left hand. Figures very
similar to these appear in contemporary votive reliefs
(cf. the figures identified by inscription on a relief in
the Catania Mus. Communale: Neumann, <title>Weihreliefs</title>
pl. 32a) and may have been inspired by the figures of
Demeter and Kore on the east frieze of the Nike
Temple (Blümel, pl. 7, figs. 20, 21); cf. also no. 165.
The style of the document relief is also closely comparable to that of the frieze; figures in both relief and frieze have the same clear distinction between the weight leg obscured by heavy folds and the free leg
revealed by clinging cloth.

<p>The decree, passed in the ninth prytany of the archonship of Antiphon (lines 2-3), concerns provisions for
enclosing and leasing various parts of the sanctuary
of Kodros, Neleus, and Basile in Athens. The stele
was to have been set up at public expense in the
Neleion, by the <term>ikria</term> (lines 27-28). (For other probable references to this shrine, see Pl. <title>Charmides</title> 1 53a
and Agora I 4138: B.D. Meritt, <title>Hesperia</title> 7 (1938) 123-26 no. 25.)
</p>
<p>Although the entire stele is preserved, the relief has
been systematically rough-picked, probably for reuse
of the stone. Only two small areas of very low relief
survive undamaged, but the general outline of the
original composition is still to some extent visible. At
the left a seated figure faces right, its left arm raised
high as though holding a spear or sceptre. Both that
hand and what appears to have been the crest of the
figure's helmet overlapped the moulding above the
relief. The figure is usually described as bearded, but
this may be only the impression created by damage
to the area around the head. At the right, facing the
figure on the left, is a figure on a rearing horse whose
head and forelegs are clearly visible in outline. The
end of the horse's tail and part of the rider's chlamys
are still preserved in very low relief at the far right.
The chlamys flies out behind the rider in several folds
ending in omega-shaped loops at the hem, a motif
that occurs in some figures of the Nike Temple frieze
(Blümel, pls. V, VI) and on the gently fluttering veil of
Hera on no. 5.
</p>

<p>Because so little is known about the cult and the
relationship between Kodros, Neleus, and Basile, and
because both figures are so badly damaged, any reconstruction of the relief must be conjectural. It has
sometimes been assumed that the sanctuary was
chiefly associated with Neleus because the inscription refers variously to the ‘the Neleion’ (lines 27-28), ‘payments to Neleus’ (lines 21-22), and the ‘temenos of Neleus and Basile’ (lines 12, 29, 32), but it is clear from the text as a whole that these are
references only to various parts of the sanctuary and
the provisions for them; Kodros is always mentioned
first in references to the sanctuary as a whole (lines 4,
14, 30-31).
</p>

<p>Neleus is a shadowy figure and difficult to characterize. Most representations of him come from Italy,
where he often appears with his mother Tyro and his
twin Pelias in the recognition scene from Sophokles'
<title>Tyro</title> (L. Séchan, <title>Études sur la tragédie grecque dans ses rapports avec la céramique</title> [1926] 224 n. 9), but he
is not depicted as a rider, and these scenes can have
nothing to do with the relief in question. It is unclear
whether in Athens he was equated with the Pylian
Neleus, father of Nestor and ancestor of Kodros, or
with the Neleus who was a son of Kodros and founder
of Ionian cities (Hdt. 10.97). H. A. Shapiro (<title>Ancient
Greek Art and Iconography</title>) has suggested the possible political significance of the Neleids to their
descendants the Peisistratids in the Archaic period,
but the only Attic representation of Neleus is a late
fifth-century vase fragment of the recognition scene
(<title>Hesperia</title> 24 [1955] 78-79 and pl. 34a).
</p>
<p>Basile, sometimes confused with Basileia, is also
obscure; the only fifth-century representation of her
is a labelled figure on a late fifth-century rf pyxis that
has not yet been fully published (O. Alexandri,
<title>ArchDelt</title> 31 B.1 [1976] 30, pl. 35a). She is certainly
also the female figure in the relief of a deme decree of
Eitea of <dateRange from="-332-07" to="-331-06">332/31</dateRange> (no. 43), which was to have been set
up in a sanctuary of Basile, and she is listed in the
sacrificial calendar of Erkhia of <term>ca</term>. 375-50 (G. Daux,
<title>BCH</title> 87 [1963] 621). There is nothing in these sources
to associate her with either of the figures in the document relief. (The inscription of the so-called Echelos-Basile relief [<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1783">NM 1783</rs>] clearly reads ‘Iasile’: O. Walter,
<title>ArchEph</title> [1937] A 113; B. D. Meritt, <title>Hesperia</title> 11
[1942] 284-85. For the distinction between Basile and
Basileia, see Shapiro, <title>ZPE</title>.)
</p>
<p>Kodros, in contrast, seems to have been a more
popular figure in fifth-century Athens. He appears
with the Eponymous and Marathonian heroes in
Phidias' Marathon monument at Delphi, probably
dating  from  the  450s  (<bibl n="Paus.  10.10.1">Paus.  10.10.1</bibl>;  Kron,
<title>Phylenheroen</title>, 215-17; E. B. Harrison, ‘Eponymous
Heroes’, 81-83), and as a fully armed warrior on the
name vase of the Codrus Painter of <term>ca</term>. 430 (<rs key="Perseus:object:Bologna, Mus. Civ. PU 273">Bologna,
Mus. Civ. PU 273</rs>: <title>ARV</title><hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1268.1; Kron, <title>Phylenheroen</title>,
pls. 15.1, 16.1 and 2). In the late fifth century it is
possible that the importance of Kodros, the Athenian
king who sacrificed himself to the Peloponnesians in
order to save Athens (Lykourg. <title>Leokr</title>. 84- 87), had
eclipsed that of Basile and Neleus and that, as the
most politically significant of the three cult personages, he would have been the most likely subject for
a type of relief that had largely political associations.
If the rider in the relief is Kodros, the figure opposite
him is as likely to be Athena as either Basile or Neleus.
She is present in most fifth-century document reliefs,
and the general outline of the figure on the left resembles that of the seated Athenas that were so common in document reliefs of the late fifth and early
fourth centuries (cf. nos. 2, 11, 71, 72, 87, 90, 91).

</p>

<p>Argos, with its long history of anti-Spartan sentiment,
was an important ally for Athens at this point in the
Peloponnesian War. The decree is a renewal of an
alliance of 420 between Athens and Argos, resumed
after the brief period of oligarchic control in Argos
that followed the Spartan victory in the Battle of
Mantineia (Thuc. 5.40-47, 82). It is securely dated to
the prytany of Aiantis in the archonship of Euphemos
(lines 2-3), which Meritt has shown to have been the
spring of <dateRange from="-417-07" to="-416-06">417/16</dateRange> (<title>Hesperia</title> 14 [1945] 125).
</p>
<p>The relief depicts Hera, the pre-eminent deity of
Argos, with her consort Zeus looking on (cf. nos. 24,
96, probably no. 41) as she clasps the right hand of
another figure, undoubtedly Athena, on the right.
Hera stands in the centre of the relief and faces right.
Her fluttering veil is caught up daintily with the thumb
and forefinger of her left hand in the gesture of unveiling characteristic of Hera as bride of Zeus. The
animated drapery with the omega-shaped fold at the
end occurs on the contemporary decree concerning
the sanctuary of Kodros, Neleus, and Basile (no. 4)
and on the Nike Temple frieze (Blümel, pls. V, VI).
All that remains of Athena are the outline of her extended hand and the damaged profile of her face. Zeus
is seated at the far left; the eagle at his side and the
front leg of his throne are preserved on the small
fragment of relief on EM 6588. He leans back in his
seat, draping his right arm over the back of it, and
raises his left arm high in front of him to hold his
sceptre, which was shown in paint. Walbank has suggested that this inscription and the honorary decree for Proxenides of Knidos (no. 68) were carved by the
same mason, but the reliefs do not appear to be by
the same hand.

<p>Found on Akropolis in 1864. Left edge of relief and inscription preserved. Taenia with first two lines of inscription and ovolo below relief. Inscribed surface battered but not worn, relief severely damaged. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.37, p.h. of relief 0.08, p.w. 0.33, th. 0.085,

</p>
<p>The inscription concerns the repayment of money
borrowed from the treasury of Athena in the course
of the Peloponnesian War and the creation of a reserve fund on the Akropolis. It was passed in the third prytany of the archon [Glauk]ippos of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange>
(lines 4-7).
</p>
<p>The relief is almost completely destroyed. At the
far left are the feet of a figure wearing a long garment.
The figure is turned toward the right, shifting its
weight on to the left foot and extending the right foot
to the side. Further right are the feet of another figure
also turned toward the right. There is space for at
least one more figure in the restored width of the
stele. Athena would almost certainly have been one
of the figures in the relief, and Erechtheus, who appears on other documents concerning Athena's treasury (nos. 8, 14, 20), would also be appropriate.

</p>
<p>The stele records two decrees concerning Athens and
Thracian Neapolis, a strategically important ally who
in this period remained loyal to Athens in her struggles with Neapolis' mother city Thasos. The first
decree (lines 4-46), passed in the sixth prytany of the
archonship of [Gl]aukippos and therefore in the winter of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (lines 4-6), honoured the people of
Neapolis for supporting Athens in its battle with
Thasos, which had been in revolt after the Sicilian
expedition (Thuc. 8.64). Two copies of this decree
were to have been set up at the expense of the Neapolitans, one apparently on the Akropolis and the
other in Neapolis in the sanctuary of the Parthenos
(lines 42-45). The second decree (lines 48-64), passed
after the recovery of Thasos in 407 (<bibl n="Diod. 13.72">Diod. 13.72</bibl>, 1;
<bibl n="Xen. Hell. 1.4.9">Xen. <title>Hell</title>. 1.4.9</bibl>), praises Neapolis for its continued
loyalty. Both the second decree and a line recording
an expenditure late in <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (line 47) were carved by
different hands and must therefore be later additions
to the stone. The stele was originally carved and set
up in the sixth prytany of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange>.
</p>
<p>On the right side of the relief stands an Athena of
the <term>angelehnte</term> type (cf. nos. 65, 76, 98) facing left,
leaning on her shield and extending her right hand,
which is broken off at the wrist. On the left side of
the relief stood a figure of whom only the right foot
is preserved. The ball of the foot rests on the ground
and the heel is raised, suggesting that the figure turned
toward Athena and clasped her extended right hand.
The figure is probably the Parthenos of Neapolis,
who is specifically mentioned in the inscription and
who appears on an Athenian decree of <dateRange from="-356-07" to="-355-06">356/55</dateRange> concerning the same city (no. 28). The elastic pose of Athena's body and the transparency of her drapery
are typical of works <term>ca</term>. 410, but the drapery does not cling like the drapery of the accounts of the treasurers of Athena of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (no. 8).

<p>Entire opisthographic stele found in Athens in 1788, taken
to Paris the next year by the Comte de Choiseul-Gouffier.
Sculpted panel on obverse separated from inscription by

</p>
<p>The stele, often referred to as the Choiseul Marble, is
inscribed on both sides with accounts of the treasurers of Athena. The distribution and interpretation
of the accounts are controversial, but the general
sequence of the work is clear. The accounts on the
obverse are for the year <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> and were carved at the
beginning of <dateRange from="-409-07" to="-408-06">409/8</dateRange>. The relief was carved at the same
time. The generally accepted date for the accounts on
the reverse (<title>IG</title> 13 377) is <dateRange from="-407-07" to="-406-06">407/6</dateRange>, but Pritchett has argued that the accounts of <dateRange from="-408-07" to="-407-06">408/7</dateRange> were also inscribed
there. Because the accounts on the reverse were inscribed by a different mason, they must have been a later addition to the stone.
</p>
<p>The relief depicts Athena and a bearded male figure,
probably Erechtheus, standing on either side of a bare
tree that probably once had painted leaves. Athena is
identified only by her characteristic dress, a belted
peplos, and her spear, held in her left hand and resting on her left shoulder. She turns slightly toward the
male figure on the right. He wears a himation and
holds a staff crutch-like under his left arm. He extends his right hand in a gesture of recognition or welcome. Unlike Athena, he is barefoot. This figure
and others like him on later records of the treasurers
of Athena have often been identified as Demos, but
there are no certain examples of the Athenian Demos
in document reliefs until well into the fourth century,
and the figures on the treasurers' documents do not
closely resemble the fourth-century figures, whose
longer hair and fuller beards make them seem considerably older (cf. nos. 38, 49, 54, 149, 167). In general type and stance the figure is very like some of the
eponymous heroes on the east frieze of the Parthenon (figures 18-28 and 43-46: Brommer, 255-56,
pls. 168, 171, 183, 184; Kron, <title>Phylenheroen</title>, 202-13,
pls. 30, 31). E. B. Harrison has identified the only
barefoot hero there as Erechtheus, his bare feet emphasizing his relationship to his mother Ge (‘Eponymous Heroes’, 71, 79). The tree between the two figures in the document relief, so emphasized by the
composition that it is surely Athena's sacred olive
tree , also supports the identification of the figure as
Erechtheus; the tree grew in the shrine shared by
Athena and Erechtheus on the Akropolis (<bibl n="Paus. 1.27.1">Paus. 1.27.1-2</bibl>; for another representation of Erechtheus standing
by a tree, see the fragmentary pelike of <term>ca</term>. 460 by
Hermonax: <rs key="Perseus:object:Agora P 8959">Agora P 8959</rs>: <title>ARV</title><hi rend="sup">2</hi> 486, 34; N. Weill,
<title>BCH</title> 86 (1962) 83-85, abb. 12, 13). As the autochthonous king of Athens reared by Athena, Erechtheus would be an especially appropriate guardian of Athena's treasury. On the inventory of the treasurers of
Athena and the Other Gods of <dateRange from="-398-07" to="-397-06">398/97</dateRange> (no. 14), a similar
figure appears again with Athena, and on the inventory
of the treasurers of Athena of <dateRange from="-377-07" to="-376-06">377/76</dateRange> (no. 20), Erechtheus may have been shown with his daughters.
</p>
<p>The transparent drapery of the relief, particularly
the delicate web of folds rhythmically slung across
Erechtheus' body, is closely related to the style of the
Sandalbinder from the Nike Temple Parapet (Carpenter, pl. XXVII). The opposing bowed curves at Athena's bent knee also occur in the Erechtheion korai (Ridgway, 106-7, fig. 82).

<p>Found by the Propylaia in 1837. Right, left edges, and top
preserved, back rough-picked. Taenia with first line of decree and ovolo separate relief from inscription. Upper corners of relief broken, upper moulding badly chipped. Surface uniformly weathered, with crack down centre. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.33, p.h. of relief 0.185, w.

0.013 (lines 1-2), 0.01 (line 3).
</p>
<p>Only three lines of the heading of the document are
preserved, but the name Kios inscribed over the head
of the male figure on the relief almost certainly indicates that the inscription concerned Bithynian Kios,
which appears regularly in the Tribute Lists. (Close
examination of the stone reveals no trace of an <title><foreign xml:lang="greek">*i</foreign></title> or <title><foreign xml:lang="greek">*s</foreign></title> in the crack to the left of the <title><foreign xml:lang="greek">*k</foreign></title>, suggested by Müller, Schöll, and Schöne.) The inscription is securely dated
to the year <dateRange from="-406-07" to="-405-06">406/5</dateRange> by its eponymous archon, [K]allias
of Angele (line 3). The editors of <title>ATL</title> suggested that
it may have been related to the Athenian ambassadors who had been held by the Persians and returned via Kios in that year (Xen. <title>Hell</title>. 1.4.7; <title>ATL</title> I, 502).
</p>
<p>The relief depicts the <term>dexiosis</term> of Athena and the
bearded figure identified as Kios, probably the companion of Herakles and founder of the city that bears his name (Strab. 12.4.3). Athena, turned in profile view toward the right, wears a peplos, aegis, shoulder
mantle, and Attic helmet, and carries her shield in her
left hand (cf. nos. 14, 69, 83). Kios, an older man
wearing a himation, is depicted in the somewhat
smaller scale often used in document reliefs for heroes and personifications. The figures are stiffer than those of the previous decade, their drapery plain and sober in contrast to the earlier rich transparency.

<p>Three non-joining fragments: a (EM 7010) found east of
Theatre of Dionysos, b (EM 7006) from Akropolis, c (Agora
I 7065) found built into wall north of tracks of electric
railway through Agora (J 5). Right and left edges preserved,
back rough-picked. Relief separated from inscription by

</p>
<p>The decree honours Epikerdes of Kyrene for his gifts
to the Athenian people. Demosthenes (20.41-45) cites
Epikerdes as an example of a patriotic benefactor who
came to the aid of Athens in times of need, both after
the Syracusan disaster and in the period before the
rule of the Thirty. This decree may concern the later
gift. It is securely dated to the year <dateRange from="-405-07" to="-404-06">405/4</dateRange> by its eponymous archon Alexias (lines 5-6).
</p>
<p>Epikerdes is the small figure on the left side of the
relief who raises his right hand in the gesture of a
worshipper. The drapery of his himation clearly reveals his body, but the material is more substantial
and less transparent than that of the previous decade.
Epikerdes faces a larger, apparently frontal figure on
the right, probably Athena, who alone bestows honours for Athens in this period. Only a small part of the very regular, tubular folds and zigzag edge of her peplos are preserved. There might have been room
for at least one more figure, perhaps a patron deity or
hero for Epikerdes, to the right.

</p>
<p>The inscription, which is securely dated to the year
<dateRange from="-405-07" to="-404-06">405/4</dateRange> by its eponymous archon Alexias (line 1), honours a <term>proxenos</term> whose name is probably to be restored as Polypos Menestheus; Wilhelm first suggested the restoration of the ethnic Gortynios. The inscription was apparently set up on the Akropolis (lines 8-10).
</p>
<p>On the right side of the relief is Athena, preserved
only from the thighs down. She is seated on a rock
facing left, with her shield lying on the ground beside
her (cf. nos. 2, 71, 72, 87, 90, 91). In the centre of the
relief are the feet of a smaller figure turned toward
Athena, probably the honorand Polypos accepting
honours from the goddess. On the left is a male figure, preserved only from the knees down, who turns
toward the other figures. He is smaller than Athena
and therefore perhaps a hero of the honorand's home
(cf. no. 72). If Polypos is from Gortyna in Crete or
Gortys in Arkadia, he may be the eponymous hero
Gortys (<bibl n="Paus. 8.53.4">Paus. 8.53.4</bibl>); cf. no. 9, depicting the eponymous hero of Kios.
</p>
<p>The drapery of the relief is plain, revealing the body
in broad, uninterrupted expanses and falling away
from it in very regular, tubular folds. The greater
interest in space in the last decade of the century is
evident in the shield at Athena's side, now considerably foreshortened, the motif probably suggested by the similar Athena on the Nike Temple Parapet
(Carpenter, pl. XIX).

<p>Nearly complete stele consisting of four joining fragments:
fragment a found on Akropolis, b and c found between
Theatre of Dionysos and Odeion of Herodes Atticus, provenance of d unknown. Top and sides preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered by antae supporting taenia and cyma reversa. Ghosts of painted meander visible on taenia. Surface well-preserved, with some corrosion, iron stains. White,
medium-grained marble. p.h. 1.71, h. of relief 0.50, w. 0.56,
th. 0.12, h. of letters 0.02-0.03 (lines 1-2), 0.013 (lines 3-4), 0.006 (lines 5 ff.).
</p>
<p>The stele records three decrees concerning Athens and
her important ally Samos. The first decree (lines 5-40), dated by its eponymous archon Alexias to <dateRange from="-405-07" to="-404-06">405/4</dateRange>, honours the Samians for their loyalty after the Athenian defeat at Aigospotamoi. The second (lines 41-55) and third (lines 56-75), voted two years later in
the archonship of Eukleides, reaffirm privileges, including Athenian citizenship for the loyal Samians,
granted in the first decree. The third also specifically
honours the Samian Poses and his sons. The heading
of the stele (lines 1-2) indicates that all three decrees
were inscribed in <dateRange from="-403-07" to="-402-06">403/2</dateRange>, when Kephisophon was secretary. One copy of the first decree was to have been set up on the Akropolis in Athens, and the Samians
were to inscribe their own copy in Samos (lines 38-40). The Athenian stele that originally carried it was probably destroyed by the Thirty.
</p>
<p>The relief, of which no. 13 is a copy, depicts the
<term>dexiosis</term> of Athena and Hera, patron goddess of Samos.
Athena stands on the right, wearing a peplos, himation,
aegis with small gorgoneion, and an Attic helmet. In
her left arm she cradles her spear pointed downward
in front of her. Behind her to the right is her shield,
resting against a bare tree stump, probably merely a
prop rather than her olive tree; cf. no. 8. (For leafless
trees and stumps as a convention of Greek relief, see
M. Carroll-Spillecke, <title>Landscape Depictions in Greek
Relief Sculpture: Development and Conventionalization</title>, European University Studies, Ser. 38, Vol. I I [Frankfurt am Main, Berne, New York 1985] 55.) Hera faces her on the left, her sceptre in her raised
left hand. She wears a peplos, shoulder mantle, and
stephane.
</p>
<p>The stele is a good example of the heaviness and
stiffness common in reliefs of the turn of the century.
Although their left legs are drawn aside, the figures
stand stiffly, with little shifting of their weight. The
turn to three-quarter view in Hera's upper body stops
abruptly at the waist, below which she is shown in
strict profile. The drapery folds, even those of Hera's
billowing mantle, have stiffened into hard, parallel
patterns. The relief as a whole has considerable depth,
created by the architectural frame, behind which
Athena's helmet crest disappears, and the overlapping
tree and foreshortened shield behind her.

<p>Two joining fragments from Akropolis. Top, both edges of
relief, left edge of inscription preserved, bottom broken.
Relief bordered above by taenia and cyma reversa, together
0.135 wide. Surface worn, flaked, corroded. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.70, p.h. of relief 0.51, w. 0.53, th. 0.115, relief h. 0.015, h. of letters 0.009.
</p>
<p>The inscription is the inventory of the treasurers of
Athena and the Other Gods who served in the
archonship of Laches, <dateRange from="-400-07" to="-399-06">400/399</dateRange> (lines 1-3). It was inscribed after their year in office, when the treasurers turned over their inventories to their successors.
</p>
<p>The relief is a copy of no. 12, which concerns
Athens and Samos and appropriately depicts Athena
and Hera. Scholars have been reluctant to accept the
figure on the left in this relief as Hera (see, for example, Süsserott, 17 n. 17, who called her ‘<term>eine nicht
sicher benennbare Göttin im Typus der Hera des
Reliefs von <dateRange from="-403-07" to="-402-06">403/02</dateRange>’</term>;), because she does not seem particularly appropriate to the inscription, but she must
have been intended here as a neutral representative of
the Other Gods. The full explanation for her presence in this relief lies in the sculptor's decision, itself puzzling, to copy the earlier relief; the relief of 399 is the only example of duplication in document reliefs.
The motif of  <term>dexiosis</term> on the inventory may refer to
the amalgamation, probably in <dateRange from="-406-07" to="-405-06">406/5</dateRange>, of the previously separate boards of treasurers of Athena and of the Other Gods.
</p>
<p>Although the treasurers' relief closely follows the
original, it lacks antae, and it is apparently by the
hand of another sculptor, whose Hera, with the exception of her too-high breasts, looks masculine.

<p>Two non-joining fragments: a (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1479">NM 1479</rs>) from 1876-77
excavations on South Slope, b (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 7801">EM 7801</rs>) found on
Akropolis in 1887. Top, both edges of relief, and left edge
of inscription preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered
above by taenia and ovolo, together 0.04 5 wide. Surface
fairly well-preserved, with some chipping, yellow-brown
stains. Grey-blue, fine-grained marble. p.h. 0.395, h. of relief 0.265, w. 0.39 5 (relief), 0.43 (inscription), th. 0.09, relief h. 0.01, h. of letters 0.01.
</p>
<p>The inscription records the inventory of the treasurers of Athena and the Other Gods who served in the
archonship of Euthykles, <dateRange from="-398-07" to="-397-06">398/97</dateRange> (lines 2-3). It would
have been inscribed immediately after their year in
office. Athena turns slightly toward the left, clasping
the right hand of a male figure of the same scale,
probably Erechtheus. She wears a peplos, aegis with
gorgoneion, and an Attic helmet, and carries her shield
in her left hand (for the shield-carrying type of Athena,
see also nos. 9, 69, 83). The male figure closely resembles several of the eponymous heroes on the east frieze
of the Parthenon (Brommer, pl. 183) and the figure,
also apparently Erechtheus, on two other records of
the treasurers of Athena (nos. 8, 20). He wears a
himation and leans on a staff propped crutch-like
under his left arm, while raising his left hand to his
chin. Of all the eponymous heroes Erechtheus, the
autochthonous king of the Athenians who shared
a shrine on the Akropolis with Athena, is the most
appropriate guardian of her treasury. It is strange that
there was no attempt in this relief to include a representative of the Other Gods (cf. no. 13, in which Hera apparently served that role).
</p>
<p>Although the figures transfer most of their weight
to their right legs, like other figures from reliefs of
this period they remain stiffly upright (cf. nos. 12, 13,
16). The folds over the upper bodies of both figures
have the rounded, doughy quality of drapery of the
Erechtheion frieze. M. B. Walbank, Classical Views
26 (1982) 262, attributes this inscription to the mason
of no. 96, but the reliefs are not the work of the same
sculptor.

</p>
<p>The document is a decree of the Athenian boule concluding an alliance between Athens and Eretria. The heading of the decree is usually restored to make the
Euboulide[s] of line 5 the eponymous archon, placing
the alliance in <dateRange from="-394-07" to="-393-06">394/93</dateRange>, when forces from Euboia fought
on the Athenian side in the Corinthian War (Xen.
<title>Hell</title>. 4.2.17; 3.1 5). Krentz has recently suggested an
alternative, that this was a decree of the Thirty in
<dateRange from="-404-07" to="-403-06">404/3</dateRange> and that Euboulides should be restored as
<term>epistates</term> rather than archon. The two dates are too
close together and the relief too poorly preserved for
the sculpture to contribute anything to the argument.
</p>
<p>Only the lower left corner of the relief is preserved.
Just above the moulding are the sandalled feet of a
seated figure facing right. The balls of the feet rest on
the flat surface of the ground; the heels are raised.
The figure appears to be seated on a rock. A seated
type of Athena is popular in reliefs of the late fifth
and early fourth centuries (see nos. 2, I I, 71, 72, 87,
90, 91), and she could appropriately face a representative of Eretria in this relief. The position of the feet is very similar to that of the Athena of the late fifth-century document concerning Athens and Samos (no. 71).

<p>Found in Theatre of Dionysos in 1862. Left edge of inscription preserved. Plain narrow taenia and ovolo below
relief. Possible traces of anta at lower left. Surface badly
worn, corroded, with vertical cracks. White, medium-grained
marble. p.h. 0.58, p.h. of relief 0.32, p.w. 0.47, th. 0.10,
relief h. 0.01, h. of letters 0.015.
</p>
<p>The document is a resolution of the Athenian <term>boule</term>
honouring Dionysios I of Syracuse, his brothers
Leptines and Thearides, and his brother-in-law
Polyxenos. (Leptines is perhaps the adopted Syracusan
father of the Alketas honoured in no. 21.) The inscription is securely dated to the sixth prytany of the archonship of Euboulides, <dateRange from="-394-07" to="-393-06">394/93</dateRange> (lines 1-2). None
of the provisions of the decree are preserved. Because
the proposer of the decree was apparently the poet
Kinesias and because it was passed at the time of the
Lenaea and according to its find-spot apparently set
up in or near the Theatre of Dionysos, Köhler suggested that the honours were in some way connected with Dionysios' well-known patronage of poets.
It comes from the beginning of a brief period of
<term>rapprochment</term> between Dionysios and Athens that was
marked by Dionysios' increasing involvement with
Athenian literary figures.
</p>
<p>The relief depicts the <term>dexiosis</term> of Athena and a female figure representing Syracuse or Sicily, a subject
more appropriate for an alliance than an honorary
decree. It is possible that, although framed as an
honorary decree, the document contained interstate
agreements of some sort, but it was not until the early
360s that Dionysios was given Athenian citizenship
(<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 103</bibl>) and contracted an alliance with Athens
(<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 105</bibl>). The Athena is an adaptation of the
Parthenos type, with her left hand resting on the rim
of her shield and a large snake coiled behind her (cf.
nos. 30, 65, 106, 132, 164). The figure opposite her
apparently wears a peplos and in her left hand holds
an object that thickens toward the top like a torch.
She has often been identified as Demeter, but the possibility that the object she holds is a torch and her somewhat smaller scale relative to Athena suggest that she is Persephone, whose head appears on the coins
of Syracuse.
</p>
<p>The relief is very badly worn, but the figures, like
others in reliefs of this period, remain stiffly upright,
the drapery over their weight legs falling in thick,
undifferentiated folds (cf. nos. 12, 13).

<p>Klazomenai had been a member of the Delian League
and was again under Athenian influence, for at this
time it was subject to the <term>eikoste</term>, the new tribute
imposed by the Athenian commander Thrasyboulos
in 389. In this decree, Athens commends Klazomenai
for its loyalty, resolves not to interfere in its trade or
other treaties, but confirms that it is still subject to
the tax. The decree is securely dated by its eponymous archon Theodotos to the year <dateRange from="-387-07" to="-386-06">387/86</dateRange> (line 1). It is usually placed in the fall of that year, for Klazomenai was claimed by Persia in the Peace of Antalkidas of
386 (Xen. <title>Hell</title>. 5.1.31).

<p>The relief depicts two animals, probably rams, facing each other. A walking or recumbent ram or a ram's head is the dominant device on the reverse of
Klazomenian bronze coins between <term>ca</term>. 387 and 300
(B. V. Head, <title>BMC: Creek Coins of Ionia</title> [1892] 21-26, pl. 4, nos. 14, 15, 16). Only three feet of the animal on the right are preserved. The animal on the left,
missing its head and part of its back, has a rather
shapeless body with tufts of hair indicated by a
bumpy-textured surface punctuated by short, sharp
incisions. Its tail is long and full, the hair indicated by
diagonal lines.

<p>Found on the Akropolis in 1889. Left edge of relief and
inscription preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered
on left by 0.045 wide anta, below by 0.06 wide moulding,
profile completely chipped away. Surface very weathered,

</p>
<p>The decree honours Hebryzelmis, the king of the
Odrysai, for his loyalty, and praises several others,
including his <term>strategos</term>. The Athenians had a history
of friendly relations with this Thracian kingdom, and
Hebryzelmis is here given all the honours that Athens had previously awarded his ancestors. The stele was to have been set up on the Akropolis at public
expense and a cost of thirty drachmai (lines 12-17). It
is securely dated to the year <dateRange from="-386-07" to="-385-06">386/85</dateRange> by its eponymous
archon Mystichides (line 1).
</p>
<p>The very poorly preserved relief depicts two horsemen, one on either side of a frontal female figure. The
Athenians generally associated Thracians with horses,
and depicted horses or horses and riders on the reliefs on most of their documents concerning Thrace
(nos. 27, 30, 46). The female figure, whose identity is
unknown, is preserved only from the chest down; she
wears a belted peplos or chiton and a veil or shoulder
mantle which flies out behind her on both sides. The
horse on the left is cut off in the middle by the anta
on the left side of the relief and above by the break
at the top of the fragment; only slight traces of its
rider and his chlamys are preserved. On the right,
only the forelegs of the horse and its rider's left foot
remain.

<p>Five fragments: a + b + c + d (together <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6907">EM 6907</rs>), from
Akropolis, e (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6907a">EM 6907a</rs>), provenance unknown. Left edge

<p>Chios had been one of the wealthiest members of
the Delian League, and in this document, securely
dated to the first prytany of the archonship of
[Diei]t[r]ephes, <dateRange from="-384-07" to="-383-06">384/83</dateRange> (lines 1-3), it again enters into
alliance with Athens. The stele was to have been set
up on the Akropolis by the agalma (lines 20-22),
which is usually taken to be the Athena Promachos
(cf. no. 84).
</p>
<p>On the left side of the relief is a frontal female
figure, preserved from the shoulders down. She wears
a chiton or peplos with a himation over it and stands
with her weight on her left leg, her right leg drawn
aside. Her very worn right hand is apparently held at
her breast; her left hand, enveloped in drapery, disappears behind her hip. In pose and dress she resembles the unidentified figure in no. 140. At the broken right edge of the fragment is part of the foot of another figure.
</p>
<p>The resemblance of the female figure to the figure
in no. 140 and the presence of the foot at the break
prompted Walter to suggest that this fragment joins
no. 131, the right half of a relief in the British Museum depicting Athena crowning a smaller male figure whose left foot is not preserved at the broken left edge. However, the British Museum relief, if it has
not been cut at the back, is not as thick as the Chios
relief, and it apparently had a moulding beneath and
wider antae at the sides. The composition resulting
from the association of the two fragments would be
more appropriate to an honorary decree for a single
individual than for an alliance with Chios.
</p>
<p>The relief is very worn, but the peculiar position of
the figure's arms, her shifting weight, and the slight
torsion in her upper body are early indications of the
freer movement and complex poses that appear more
frequently in the second quarter of the century (cf.
no. 24).

<p>Found west of Erechtheion in 1858. Top, right edge preserved. Relief bordered above and below by 0.065 wide
moulding consisting of taenia and ovolo. Surface somewhat
worn, chipped, corroded, with red-brown iron stains. White,
medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.55, h. of relief 0.45, p.w.
0.355, th. 0.12, relief h. 0.015, h. of letters 0.007.
</p>
<p>The inscription is the inventory of the treasurers of
Athena in <dateRange from="-377-07" to="-376-06">377/76</dateRange>; the board had been separated from
the amalgamated boards of the treasurers of Athena
and the Other Gods (nos. 13, 14) in <dateRange from="-386-07" to="-385-06">386/85</dateRange>. Only
part of the heading is preserved, but the restoration
of the eponymous archon Kalleas in line 1 is certain.
The inventory would have been inscribed immediately after the end of the treasurers' term.
</p>
<p>Seated on a rock at the right is a bearded figure,
probably Erechtheus. His left elbow rests on the rock
behind him, and he cradles a sceptre in his left arm.
He wears a himation and a fillet around his head.
Further to the left is a female figure, of whom only
part of the left arm and leg are preserved. She moves
swiftly toward the left as the ends of her himation fly
out behind her.
</p>
<p>In general type the male figure resembles the other
figures, apparently Erechtheus, on an earlier record
of the treasurers of Athena (no. 8) and on an inventory of the treasurers of Athena and the Other Gods (no. 14). The rocky seat of this relief, like the olive
tree of the treasurers' accounts of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (no. 8), may
refer to his rocky home on the Akropolis, where he
shared a shrine with Athena and guarded her treasury. The fragmentary female figure resembles the last
figure in the dancing triads of Nymphs and Charites
on late fifth- and early fourth-century Attic votive
reliefs (Mitropoulou, Corpus I, figs. 151, 152) and the
dancing figures related to them, usually identified as
Horai and Aglaurids, on neo-Attic reliefs (E. B.
Harrison, <title>AJA</title> 81 (1977) figs. 4-7, 10, 11). The iconography of the dancing triads was already flexible in
the late fifth century, however, and the figures could
also represent the daughters of Erechtheus. The restoration of the first lines of the treasurers' inventory leaves room for all three dancers in the missing left half of the relief.
</p>
<p>The drapery of Erechtheus, particularly the parallel, rounded folds over his lap and the folds falling between his legs, resembles late fifth-century drapery
and probably looks back to the models upon which
the figures were based (cf. no. 5).

<p>Two joining fragments from Akropolis. Broken along right
edge and bottom. Relief crowned by plain pediment with
badly damaged akroteria. Horizontal sima of pediment inscribed with name of archon; remainder of heading inscribed
in three lines on upper part of relief. Narrow, rounded
band separates relief from crown carved immediately below. Surface somewhat worn, with vertical cracks. White,
medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.1, p.w. 0.335, th. 0.08, relief h. very low, h. of letters 0.011.
</p>
<p>The document is an honorary decree for Alketas,
son of Leptines of Syracuse, undoubtedly the same
Leptines who was honoured along with his brother
Dionysios in no. 16. Foucart suggested that his son
was named after Alketas I, king of the Molossians,
who was an exile in Syracuse (<bibl n="Diod. 15.13">Diod. 15.13</bibl>), but it is
more likely, as Kirchner following Dittmar believed,
that this Alketas is the Molossian king himself, who
in exile had been adopted by Leptines. The date of
the inscription, set at <dateRange from="-373-07" to="-372-06">373/72</dateRange> by its eponymous archon
Asteios (line 1), also points to the Molossian Alketas,
for early in 373 Alketas, who apparently by this time
had joined the Second Athenian League (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 43</bibl>,
line B 13), assisted an Athenian force sent to Korkyra
(Xen. <title>Hell</title>. 6.2.10), and that winter he went on to
Athens to support the general Timotheus at his trial
(<bibl n="Dem. 49.22">Dem. 49.22</bibl>).
</p>
<p>The arrangement of the text, with three lines of the
heading inscribed on the relief, is unusual. In the centre of the relief, facing left, is a large horse standing
quietly on the narrow band representing the ground
line. Below the band is the upper part of a fragmentary
olive crown. Walter believed that the horse, depicted
in such close association with the crown, was a reference to an equestrian victory of Alketas rather than a
symbol of Syracuse or Epiros. The reliefs of the decree honouring the Molossian Alketas' son Arybbas
(no. 122) apparently also refer to equestrian victories.

<p>Only the bare outlines of the relief are still intelligible. On the left is Zeus, seated facing right. His left

holds an object; the second is barely visible. There

<p>In the 360s Athens made a sustained attempt to recover the strategically important city of Amphipolis,
which had maintained its independence after Athens
lost control of it at the end of the fifth century;
members of the Chalcidian League who had earlier
seceded from the Athenian League allied with
Amphipolis. This decree, securely dated to the sixth
prytany of the archonship of Charikleides of <dateRange from="-363-07" to="-362-06">363/62</dateRange>
(lines 2-3), honours Menelaos the Pelagonian for his
assistance in the war against the Chalkidians and
Amphipolis. He was probably a king or prince of the
Lynkestians, and it is likely that he was the same
Menelaos who fought Philip in Thrace in 351 (Dem.
4.27). He was apparently later made an Athenian
citizen (Tod II, no. 148).
</p>
<p>On the left is a small male figure, probably
Menelaos; only his lower legs remain. He turns right,
toward a larger male figure in a himation, probably
Demos or a patron deity, who is preserved only from
the knees down. At the far right is Athena, of whom
only a small fragment of drapery and the bottom of
her shield are preserved. The relief is rather crudely
cut, the drapery falling in coarse, heavy folds indicated by sharp, deeply cut lines.

<p>When Sparta refused to sign the peace treaty after the
battle of Mantineia in 362, the Peloponnesian states
that had alliances with the Athenian League through
their own alliances with Sparta had to deal with Athens separately. This decree is an alliance between Athens and Arkadia, Achaia, Elis, and Phleious, securely dated by its eponymous archon Molon to the
year <dateRange from="-362-07" to="-361-06">362/61</dateRange> (line 1). The relief, which is very similar
to that of the alliance between Athens and Korkyra
(no. 96), depicts three figures, of whom two are certainly Athena and Zeus. On the right is Zeus, enthroned facing left; his feet rest on a low stool. His
left hand, which is broken away, holds a thunderbolt,
of which only the end is preserved. His right hand,
also missing, was raised and probably held a sceptre,
of which a trace may be just visible above his right
thigh. The central figure turns toward him. Her right
hand is raised and holds the edge of her mantle in an
unveiling gesture. Her left hand holds her sceptre.
Her head is completely destroyed, but a long lock of
hair hangs over her right shoulder. Further left stands
Athena, turned toward the others, holding her spear
in her raised left hand. Her right hand rests on her
hip. Her shield stands at her left side.
</p>
<p>Scholars have long identified the central figure in
this relief as a personification of the Peloponnese, the
name used to refer to the allies in one place in the
inscription, but place personifications in document
reliefs are rare (nos. 66, 120), and both the dress and
the gesture and position of the figure with respect to
Zeus strongly suggest that the figure is Hera (cf. nos.
5, 96, perhaps no. 41). Zeus and Hera would be appropriate representatives of the Peloponnesian allies,
for the sanctuary of Zeus and Hera at Olympia was
the major sanctuary not only of the signatory Elis
but also of the entire Peloponnese. The enthroned,
thunderbolt-wielding Zeus is Zeus Olympios who
with Athena Polias heads the list of deities invoked in
the alliance.
</p>
<p>Although the figures of Zeus and Hera appear to
have been based upon late fifth-century models (cf.
no. 5), the higher-waisted proportions of the female
figures and the interest in such relatively naturalistic
effects as the buckling material at the knees of Zeus
and Hera and the pulling of drapery across Hera's
breasts are indicative of a new style phase. Hera closely
resembles copies of the approximately contemporary
Eirene of Kephisodotos (Palagia, Euphranor, fig. 42).

</p>
<p>The decree honours the <term>proxenos</term> Sochares, son of
Chares of Pontic Apollonia, for his assistance in the
battle for Methone, which fell to Philip in the summer of 354 (<bibl n="Diod. 16.31.6">Diod. 16.31.6</bibl>; 34.4-5). The decree is securely dated to the fifth prytany of the archonship of
[Kalli]stratos, <dateRange from="-355-07" to="-354-06">355/54</dateRange> (lines 2-4). Sochares himself was
to pay for the stele, which, like the decree for Philiskos
of Sestos of the same year (no. 30), was to have been
set up within ten days, apparently on the Akropolis
(lines 15-19).
</p>
<p>Apollo, the patron deity of Sochares' Apollonia, is
seated on an omphalos at the far right, with a female
figure, probably his mother Leto, beside and slightly
behind him on the left. Leto's right hand is raised to
her shoulder as though holding or adjusting her mantle (cf. the similarly posed figure with Artemis in the Villa Albani metope, Ridgway, fig. 11); her left hand
rests on her hip. Athena, who wears a peplos, aegis
with gorgoneion, and helmet, turns away from them
toward the left. She extends her right hand, perhaps
holding a crown, toward the broken left side of the
relief where Sochares must have once stood; the foot
of another figure is preserved beside the anta of the
fragment in Athens.
</p>
<p>Although Athena still has a curved fold running
along the contour of her bent left leg, her drapery
otherwise falls in straight, heavy folds. Leto's himation
is bunched around her waist in a manner resembling
the drapery of the standing figure in the decree of
<dateRange from="-347-07" to="-346-06">347/46</dateRange> honouring the Bosporan kings (no. 35).

<p>The fragmentary inscription is an Athenian decree,
securely dated by its secretary Dieuches of Phrearrhioi
(lines 2-3), who served in the archonship of Kallimachos, <dateRange from="-349-07" to="-348-06">349/48</dateRange> (IG II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 206). Its find-spot and the subject of its relief suggest that it concerned Eleusinian
matters (cf. no. 3). All that remains of the relief is a
figure of Demeter, preserved only from the waist
down, seated on a kiste facing left. Kore and perhaps
another figure or figures probably originally stood
on the left. The figure resembles figures of Demeter
who appear with Kore on other document reliefs from
Eleusis (nos. 127, 152), on fourth-century votive
reliefs (e.g. Neumann, <title>Weihreliefs</title>, pl. 47a; Walter,
<title>Beschreibung</title>, fig. 114), and on Panathenaic amphorae
(Jucker, figs. 22-24; Eschbach, 71-90, pls. 20, 21).
Kern and Jucker suggested that the types were modelled after an Eleusinian cult group, but details of the various versions of the type differ considerably.

</p>
<p>The Bosporan kingdom, an important source of grain,
had had friendly relations with Athens since the second half of the fifth century. After the death of its king Leukon, his sons Spartokos II and Pairisades I
sent envoys to Athens with a letter seeking assurance
that the relationship would continue, and this decree
is the Athenian response. In return for the export of
wheat and other unspecified services, Athens extends
to them all the privileges granted their father Leukon
and grandfather Satyros, and promises to crown each
of them with a 1000-drachmai gold crown at each
Greater Panathenaia. A rider provides that their
brother Apollonios be crowned as well. The decree is
securely dated to the eighth prytany of the archonship
of Themistokles, <dateRange from="-347-07" to="-346-06">347/46</dateRange> (lines 3 - 5). It was to have
been erected by the stele honouring Leukon and
Satyros at public expense and a cost of thirty drachmai
(lines 44-49); decrees concerning Leukon were set
up in Piraeus (Dem. 20.36), where this stele was found.
</p>
<p>The relief of the huge stele is unusual in its strong
characterization of the honorands and the deferential
absence of any representative of Athens. The two
figures on the left, probably the rulers Spartokos and
Pairisades, are seated together on a large, claw-footed
throne. The standing figure leaning on a staff would
be Apollonios, who did not share in their rule. The
brothers are depicted with beards, and Spartokos and
Pairisades have long hair falling over their shoulders,
an attempt at characterizing them as foreigners that
originally might have extended to their facial features
as well; in type and style, they resemble the freestanding figures from the Mausoleion of Halikarnassos and a mid-fourth-century colossal statue found at
Kertch, site of the Bosporan capital, possibly representing one of the Bosporan kings (G. B. Waywell, <title>The Free-Standing Sculptures of the Mausoleum of
Halicarnassus in the British Museum</title> (London 1978),

<title>Die Antiken Skulpturen der Hermitage</title> I (Berlin and
Leipzig 1928) 50 no. 36, pl. XVIII). In its high relief,
monumental figures disposed comfortably within the
deep space of the frame, and its voluminous drapery
with deeply carved folds, the relief more closely resembles the better contemporary grave reliefs than other mid-century document reliefs (cf. Diepolder, pls. 45, 46).

<p>Entered collection of the Venetian Nani in eighteenth century; acquired by Musée Calvet in 1841. Both edges preserved, broken top and bottom. Antae support moulding with first line of inscription, pediment. Surface worn. Reportedly Pentelic marble. p.h. 0.41, w. 0.41, th. 0.07, h. of

</p>
<p>The decree, of which only the heading is preserved, is
a grant of proxeny to Phokinos, Nikandros, and a
man whose name is probably to be restored as
Dexippos. Their dress suggests that they are being
honoured in connection with military activity. Phokinos may have been related, as Reinach suggested, to the fourth-century Megarian <term>strategos</term> Phokinos. The
decree is securely dated to the ninth prytany of the
archonship of [Theophra]st[os] I of <dateRange from="-340-07" to="-339-06">340/39</dateRange> (lines 2-3) by the coincidence of its secretary to that of <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 233</bibl>.
</p>
<p>The relief depicts the three men as warriors being
honoured by Athena. Athena stands on the far right,
her right hand holding a crown that she is about to
place on the head of the figure nearest her. She wears
a peplos and Corinthian helmet; her left hand rests
on the rim of the shield standing beside her. The three
smaller honorands all wear hoplite corselets over short
tunics. The first, tallest figure wears a helmet with a
crest. The position of his left hand suggests that he
carried a painted shield which is not preserved. His
right hand is raised, as are those of the other two
figures, in a gesture of adoration. The second figure
is slightly smaller and wears a helmet without a crest.
His raised left hand holds a spear which is lightly
incised on the relief ground. The third, still smaller
figure wears a cap-like helmet with a spike on top
and in his left hand carries a bow which is also incised on the background. It is not clear whether the differences in the scale of the honorands or their helmet types are significant. The relief is very crudely
carved, with details of the honorands sharply gouged
in the relief and cursorily incised into the relief ground.
In its low relief, flat frame, and figure types, it resembles a number of reliefs of the third quarter of the fourth century (nos. 38, 143-148).

and Alexander of Macedonia (Arr. <title>Anab</title>. 1.18.1;
Harp., s.v. Alkimachos). The decree is securely dated
to the sixth prytany of the archonship of Phryni[chos],
<dateRange from="-337-07" to="-336-06">337/36</dateRange> (lines 3-4). Only the badly damaged lower
left corner of the relief is preserved, depicting the
lower part of a seated figure, perhaps Athena, facing
right. It is possible to distinguish part of the seat, the
foot rest, and her lower right leg where bunched folds
emerge from beneath her himation. Alkimachos may
have stood facing her on the right.

<p>Only a few fragmentary lines of this inscription, a
dedication by a group of ephebes who had been honoured by the state, are preserved, but it is securely
dated to the year <dateRange from="-334-07" to="-333-06">334/33</dateRange> by its eponymous archon
K[te]si[kles] (line 1). At the left is Athena, turned
toward the right, her left hand resting on the rim of
the shield beside her. Her raised right hand originally
held a painted spear. She wears a peplos, aegis with
gorgoneion, and a shoulder mantle. There is room for
another figure or figures, perhaps a representative of
the ephebes and their patron, in the missing right side
of the relief. The frontality of the figure and her high-waisted proportions, with the part of the overfall below the belt longer than the part above, are typical of figures from the third quarter of the century. The
billowing shoulder mantle resembles that of the approximately contemporary Athena in no. 142.

</p>
<p>The stele carried three decrees, all dealing with
Archippos, probably the son of the Thasian Archippos
honoured in no. 86. His citizenship is reaffirmed in
the first two decrees; the third appears to restrict his
choice of phratry. The detailed deliberations concerning the mechanics of Archippos' citizenship suggest
that he actually intended to claim it; Osborne suggested that he moved to Athens when his pro-Athenian views became unpopular in Thasos. The first
decree is dated by its secretary to the archonship of
Ktesikles, <dateRange from="-334-07" to="-333-06">334/33</dateRange> (line 1). Fragment b begins with the
end of another decree that includes the provisions for
its publication. Line 6 of fragment b begins a third
decree with an abbreviated dating formula; the preceding decree would have had the complete one. The
dating formula of <dateRange from="-334-07" to="-333-06">334/33</dateRange> does not fit the third decree. Dow convincingly restored the secretary of <dateRange from="-333-07" to="-332-06">333/32</dateRange> for the third and therefore also for the second decree. All three decrees, carved by the same mason,
must have been inscribed together in <dateRange from="-333-07" to="-332-06">333/32</dateRange>. Osborne
estimates that the stele was a very large one, similar
in size to the stele honouring Herodoros (no. 59).
</p>
<p>Only the bottom left half of the relief is preserved,
depicting the feet of two figures who in their types
and relationship to each other resemble representations of Zeus and Hera in other document reliefs (nos.
5, 24, 96). The standing Hera on the left turns toward
the seated Zeus on the right, whose feet rest on a low
stool. Their placement in the relief is awkward, with
Zeus turning his back on the figure or figures who
must have been on the right side of the relief, but it
is probably dictated here, as elsewhere in document
reliefs, by an apparent desire to emphasize the relationship between Zeus and Hera (cf. nos. 24, 96). The awkwardness may have been mitigated by the presence of Athena, perhaps bestowing the 1000-drachmai
gold wreath awarded in the first decree; the restoration of the text indicates that the preserved relief fragment accounts for only about half the width of the stele. The pair would be appropriate patron deities if,
as seems very likely, the Archippos in question was
from Thasos. There was a sanctuary of Zeus Agoraios
in Thasos, and the reliefs of Zeus and Hera on the
city's gates must have been well-known (Pouilloux,
<title>Cultes de Thasos I</title>, 227, 230-32; C. Picard, <title>Études
thasiennes VIII</title> [<title>Les murailles I: les portes sculptées à
images divines</title>] [1962] 150-76, pl. XLII; P. Bernard,
<title>BCH</title> 89 [1965] 64-89).
</p>
<p>The arrangement of the drapery, with its contrast
of regular, rounded folds over Hera's weight leg and
clinging drapery over her free leg, recalls that of late
fifth-century peplophoroi, but the material is stiff and
heavy.

</p>
<p>The fragmentary relief depicts a sphinx and a Chian
amphora, symbols associated with the island's famous
wine, found on the coins, weights, and amphora

Inscribed on border above relief: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q*e*o*i</foreign> Surface worn, corroded. Deep horizontal cut, perhaps ancient attempt to separate relief and inscription, extends width of stele just below

</p>
<p>The decree of the deme Eitea honours Hippokles
Demokleous for his services to the deme; he is
awarded a 500-drachmai gold wreath. Whether the
deme is Eitea of Akamantis or of Antiochis is not
specified. Kaloyeropoulou suggested that Hippokles
was the father of Samakion Hippokleous Eiteaiou,
whose grave stele was found in the Kerameikos (<bibl><title>IG</title>
II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 6007</bibl>: A. Conze, <title>Die attischen Grabreliefs</title> III.1
(1906), no. 1430, pl. 295). The inscription is dated by
reference to the treasurer of the deme as an officer
serving in the archonship of Ni[ketes], <dateRange from="-332-07" to="-331-06">332/31</dateRange> (lines
16-18). The treasurer was to have published it at the
deme's expense, and it was to have been set up in the
sanctuary of Basile (lines 15-20).
</p>
<p>The relief depicts the small, bearded figure of
Hippokles being crowned by a larger female figure
who must be Basile, since the stele was to have been
erected in her sanctuary. Hippokles stands opposite
her on the left and raises his right hand in a gesture
of adoration. Basile is about to place the crown on
his head with her right hand. She wears a belted chiton
and himation; her hair is pulled back in a short, high
top knot.
</p>
<p>There is little evidence for the character of Basile,
often confused with Basileia. (For her cult in Athens
and elsewhere in Attica, see no. 4 and Shapiro, <title>ZPE</title>.)
Her role in the inscription and relief from Grammatiko suggests that hers was the major cult in the deme of Eitea at this time.</p>
<p>Kaloyeropoulou noted that the palmette was
normally used as a <term>terminus</term> of grave stelai rather than
official documents and that the stone was probably
originally intended for funerary use. The figures appear hastily cut, superficially resembling the types and style of the relief of the Athenian anti-tyranny decree (no. 38).

<p>The decree, proposed by Lykourgos, honours a
Plataian whose name is not preserved. It is securely
dated to the eighth prytany of the archonship of
Niketes, <dateRange from="-332-07" to="-333-06">332/3</dateRange> 1 (lines 2-3); it was passed on the same
day as no. 45, but the hands of neither the masons
nor the sculptors appear to have been the same. The
figures in the relief are too poorly preserved for identification. At the left are the bare lower legs of a male
figure, possibly the honorand, turned toward the right.
Next to him on the right stands a female figure in a
long garment, perhaps Athena, of whom only the
lower legs are preserved. The figure appears nearly
frontal, standing with her weight on her right leg.
The tiny fragment of relief preserved on fragment b
is probably part of the right anta.

<p>The decree honours Anphis (<term>sic</term>?) of Andros, whom
Wilhelm identified as the poet Amphis of Middle
Comedy. The <title>Suda</title> (s.v. Amphis) refers to him as an
Athenian, but Wilhelm supposed that his citizenship
was awarded at a later date. He is here awarded a
crown of ivy, appropriate for a poet because of its
association with Dionysos. The decree was passed on
the same day as no. 44, in the eighth prytany of the
archonship of [N]iketes, <dateRange from="-332-07" to="-331-06">332/31</dateRange> (lines 1-3), but it does
not appear to have been inscribed or sculpted by the
same men.
</p>
<p>The relief preserves the lower legs of two male figures wearing himatia. The smaller figure on the left turns in three-quarter view toward the right, advancing with his weight on his left leg. The larger figure
approaches him from the right, with his weight on
his right leg. The smaller figure undoubtedly represents Amphis, the large figure probably Demos, presenting a crown to the poet. The restoration of the
inscription indicates that there was no room in the relief for another figure. The workmanship is rough and clumsy.

left hand rests on the rim of her shield: her right hand

frontal male figure of the same or slightly smaller scale, but the fragmentary inscription does not provide a clue to his identity. He is bisected vertically by
the straight right edge of the fragment. His right arm
hangs at his side. He probably wore a himation; a
bulge at his hip seems to indicate a bunch of drapery.
The restored width of the inscription indicates that
there could have been at least one more figure on the
right side of the relief.

<p>Four joining fragments: <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 2811">EM 2811</rs> (with relief), composed
of three fragments, + <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 7180">EM 7180</rs>, found in 1838 between
Parthenon and Propylaia. Top and both edges preserved,
back and top rough-picked. Relief bordered by antae supporting entablature, below by taenia inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q*e</foreign>[<foreign xml:lang="greek">*o*i</foreign>] and
ovolo. Surface battered, corroded. White, medium-grained
marble. p.h. 0.62, h. of relief 0.35, w. 0.48. th. 0.175, relief

</p>
<p>The document is an honorary decree for Asklepiodoros, apparently an ambassador in treaty negotiations with Phokis, which joined the Greek revolt after the death of Alexander. The decree is often restored
to include a second ambassador, but the inscription is
too fragmentary for certainty on this point. The presence of a single honorand in the relief strongly implies that only one man is honoured, or at least that
the honours for Asklepiodoros take precedence over
any others that might have been given. The second
crown is not significant in this respect, as other stelai
with only one honorand and more than one crown
attest (no. 53; <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 360</bibl>). The decree is securely dated
to the third prytany of the archonship of [Kephisodoros], <dateRange from="-323-07" to="-322-06">323/22</dateRange> (lines 1-3) by the coincidence of its secretary with that of the first decree of <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 448</bibl>.  
</p>
<p>At the left stands Athena, holding a crown in both
hands. On the right a small male figure representing
Asklepiodoros is being crowned simultaneously by
two figures, almost certainly Demos and Boule, who
are slightly larger than the honorand yet smaller than
Athena. Boule conforms very closely to the type
attested for her by the inscription on no. 142. The
unusual arrangement of her himation, drawn over her
head like a veil, with a distinctive curved edge of
drapery running straight from the right shoulder to
the triangular overfold at the waist, is shared by both
figures. Demos also closely resembles a standing type
confirmed for him by inscription (no. 117), which
appears more frequently in document reliefs (nos. 54,
149, 150, 172) than figures of Boule,
</p>
<p>The relief is roughly carved, but the very high-waisted female figures and the pronounced swing in Demos' stance are consistent with stylistic developments of the late fourth century.

</p>
<p>The very fragmentary inscription records two decrees
honouring several people, apparently Bosporans, who
have given grain and some other gift or assistance
needed by Athens, perhaps to alleviate shortages
caused by the Lamian War. It is securely dated to the
eighth prytany of the archonship of Ke[phisod]oros,
<dateRange from="-323-07" to="-322-06">323/22</dateRange> (lines 2-3). Athens had earlier honoured the
kings of the Crimean Bosporos (no. 35) for their role
in providing Athens with grain.
</p>
<p>The wide, well-cut moulding above the inscription
must have supported a large, ambitious relief, but all
that remains is the foot of a single figure turned
toward the left in the centre of the panel.

<p>Found in 1952 Agora excavations in wall of medieval house

</p>
<p>The content of the inscription is not known; little
more than the heading is preserved. Meritt has shown
that the only year in which the lunar and conciliar
dates given in the inscription coincide is that of the
archonship of [Archipp]os, <dateRange from="-321-07" to="-320-06">321/20</dateRange> (line 2); the inscription belongs to the fifth prytany (line 4). On the right stands a female facing right, of whom only the
lower legs are preserved. Opposite her on the left is
a large dolphin with its snout down and its back
arched; most of the body and tail are broken away.
The stance and dress of the figure are archaistic. Her
weight is evenly distributed, the folds between her
legs are bunched in the central gathering common in
the dress of Archaic statues, and the diagonal line of
zigzag folds on her left side indicates the open side of
her peplos or end of her long diagonal mantle. The
archaizing style must have been used here to indicate
that the figure is a statue, presumably of the patron
goddess of the person, city, or cult with which the
decree is concerned (cf. no. 28, which depicts an
archaistic  figure representing the Parthenos  of
Neapolis). The dolphin must be one of her attributes
or a symbol of the party she represents.

a <term>phyle</term> (cf. nos. 107, 128, 138, 145, 157, possibly no.

<dateRange from="-318-07" to="-317-06">318/17</dateRange>, the two years with eponymous archons named
Archipp[os] (line 3).
</p>
<p>Athena or another figure holding a shield stood to
the left; only the shield is preserved. If the document
is a <term>phyle</term> decree and the figure with the shield is
Athena, the <term>phyle</term> hero may have stood further to the
left (cf. no. 138). The <term>epimeletai</term> are depicted on the
right as three small bearded men wearing himatia.
The first man turns toward Athena and raises his right
hand. The second figure is largely frontal. The third
man leans with his right arm on the shoulder of the
second, his right leg casually crossing the left. His left
hand rests on his hip.
</p>
<p>The small figures are crudely carved and very worn,
but the variety and combination of their positions
echo the relative complexity of composition in better
reliefs of the late fourth century (cf. nos. 47, 54).

<p>Complete stele found in Late Roman fortifications near Stoa
of Attalos during 1891 extension of Athens-Piraeus railway. Top, sides preserved, bottom set in modern base, back
smooth. Relief bordered by antae (0.0475 wide on left, 0.04
wide on right) supporting entablature with antefixes, below
by taenia and ovolo, together 0.085 wide. Surface worn,
particularly on right side, with accretions, iron stains; stele
had been used as drain cover. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 2.35, h. of relief 0.60, w. of relief 0.66, w. of inscription 0.60 (top), 0.65 (bottom), th. 0.30 (relief), 0.25 (top of inscription), 0.29 (bottom of inscription), relief h.

</p>
<p>The stele carries two decrees, the first a republication
of a decree granting Euphron, son of Adeas of Sikyon,
and his descendants Athenian citizenship for his alliance with Athens in the Lamian War, the second reaffirming the first and authorizing the republication.
Euphron had been responsible for ridding Sikyon of
a Macedonian garrison and establishing democracy
there shortly before his trip to Athens. The first decree (lines 2-34) was passed in the fifth prytany of
the archonship of Kephisodoros of <dateRange from="-323-07" to="-322-06">323/22</dateRange> (lines 1-2), but was rescinded and the original stele recording
it probably destroyed by the oligarchy which came
into power later that year. The second (lines 35-87)
is a resolution passed by the restored democracy in
the fourth prytany of the archonship of Archippos,
318 (lines 35-36). Euphron had since been killed resisting the Macedonians, but the reaffirmation was
necessary to ensure that the original honours would
be extended to his son. Two copies of the stele were
to have been set up, one on the Akropolis, the other
by Zeus Soter, a reference to the statue of Zeus
Eleutherios/Soter in the Agora (lines 68-70); copies
of the original decree were apparently set up in the
same locations (lines 26-28). The stele in the National Museum must be the Agora copy; a fragmentary, now lost inscription found on the Akropolis
(<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 575</bibl>) may have been a copy of the original
decree set up there (Osborne, <title>Naturalization</title>, D 41).
Both decrees stipulate that the treasurer of the <term>demos</term>
is to pay fifty drachmai for the publication (lines 29-31, 85 - 87), but the second decree has the unusual
provision that the friends and relatives of Euphron
contribute to the publication of the decrees (lines 72-73), probably because the honorand was deceased and
the decrees were being published in their interest.
</p>
<p>On the left stands Athena, wearing a chiton under
a belted peplos, a mantle over her raised left and lowered right arms, a collar aegis with gorgoneion, and a
helmet. Her raised left hand held her painted spear.
Next to Athena is a bearded figure who turns toward
the much smaller Euphron at the right. His extended
right hand probably held a crown representing the
1000-drachmai gold crown awarded Euphron in the
decree. The figure has often been identified as Zeus
Soter because one copy of the decree was to have
been set up by his statue, but the figure is slightly
smaller than Athena, suggesting that he is Demos
(cf. nos. 38, 49, 117, 133, 149, 150, 167, 172). Since
Euphron was the leader of the democrats in Sikyon
who had once before freed his city from Macedonia
and established a democracy there, Demos would be
an appropriate representative of the democracies he
had served in Sikyon and Athens.
</p>
<p>In an unusual instance of anecdote in a document
relief, Euphron is depicted as just having arrived in
Athens with his offer of alliance, the action for which
he is praised in the first decree. He stands before
Athena and Demos wearing a short chiton, a sword
on a strap fastened diagonally across his chest, and a
mantle thrown over his left shoulder. Behind him on
the right are his horse, just emerging from behind the
anta, and a small groom or servant actively restraining it. The horse's metal reins originally were attached
to the hole near its mouth. The groom wears a
chlamys. His right leg is missing; a small hole in the
break at his groin may be the result of an ancient repair.
</p>
<p>The figure of Athena in this relief is usually cited
as a copy of the original of the Castra Praetoria
Athena (Rome, Museo Nuovo Capitolino inv. 1829:
Helbig<hi rend="sup">4</hi>, 510-11 no. 1732; M. Bieber, <title>The Sculpture
of the Hellenistic Age</title><hi rend="sup">2</hi> (1961) figs. 210-I 2). Her pose,
proportions, and the mantle worn over both shoulders resemble details of the Castra Praetoria statue, but other differences in details of her drapery, the
position of her left arm, and her helmet type indicate
that the relationship is not very close.
</p>
<p>Although Euphron's relief is unusually large and
elaborate for a document relief, with metal attachments and figures carved in such high relief that some
of their limbs are entirely detached from the relief
ground, the figures appear small within their deep
frame, lacking the monumentality of the Bosporans
of no. 35 and many figures in contemporary grave
reliefs. The fans of roughly parallel, round, and revealing ridge-folds in the himation of Demos are typical
of much earlier works, but the way that they stretch
diagonally from ankle to hip is typical of the late
fourth century. Athena's high-waisted proportions,
with her belt beneath her breasts, are characteristic of
female figures of the end of the century (no. 59).

<p>The decree honours a man whose name is not preserved who served as an archon, perhaps as Meritt suggested, in one of the ‘Athenian overseas dependencies’. The man is honoured for his services in the
archonship of Eukrates, <dateRange from="-146-07" to="-145-06">146/45</dateRange> (line 4). The decree
dates from the following year, after his term had been
reviewed. On the right stands a figure, probably male,
preserved only from the knees down. He turns in
three-quarter view toward the left, where there is an
altar, of which two steps and part of a triglyph of the
superstructure are preserved. The figure may be a deity
or the honorand himself. What remains of the relief
appears to have been relatively high and carefully
carved.

<p>Three fragments found in Athens in 1933, in work on
Leoforos Syngrou near Church of Hagios Sostos. Top, both
edges preserved, back rough-picked. Considerable part of
relief missing between two joining top fragments and fragment with bottom of relief and inscription. In back, two
large, round holes, 0.08 diam., 0.04 deep, probably for reuse of stone. Relief bordered by architectural frame consisting of 0.055-0.06 wide antae supporting 0.06 wide taenia and 0.12 high pediment with akroteria. Relief somewhat worn, chipped, with accretions on upper fragment. Grey,

</p>
<p>The decree of the <term>orgeones</term> of Aphrodite honours their
<term>epimeletes</term> Serapion for his service to the cult and to
the <term>demos</term> of the Athenians. It is securely dated to the
archonship of Timarchos, <dateRange from="-138-07" to="-137-06">138/37</dateRange> (line 1). The stele
was to have been set up in the sanctuary of Aphrodite
(lines 19-20).
</p>
<p>The figure on the right side of the relief is larger
than the other figures and thus probably Aphrodite;
only her legs and a trace of the top of her head are
preserved. She turns toward the left and in her left
hand holds a sceptre, apparently resting on her shoulder. The two figures on the left are slightly smaller in
scale and therefore probably mortals, Serapion and
his wife or perhaps a priestess. Serapion, who wears
a wreath, is a portrait of a middle-aged man with a
round face, large nose, and short, curly hair. The
female figure wears a peplos or chiton and a mantle
pulled up over the back of her head like a veil. She
appears to raise her right hand almost to her chin. In
the centre of the relief is an altar and behind it a pillar
supporting a very small figure, intended as a statue in
the distance. The figure turns toward the right and
holds a crown or phiale in her extended right hand.
In her left hand she holds a spear. She wears a chiton,
himation, and diagonally draped aegis. Perched beside her on the pillar is a small bird or animal.
</p>
<p>The individualization of the honorand and the suggestion of deep space in the distant pillar reflect Hellenistic interest in portraiture and the depiction of illusionistic space in relief.

<p>The <term>prytaneis</term> of Pandionis are praised for their celebration of a <term>pannychis</term> during their term of office.
Meritt suggested that the goddess honoured was
Athena Ergane and that the festival was the Chalkeia.
The decree is securely dated to the archonship of
Lennaios, <dateRange from="-118-07" to="-117-06">118/17</dateRange> (line 1). Only a small section of
relief is preserved near the left edge of the inscription,
showing vertical drapery folds of a figure in a long
garment turned toward the right. Reliefs on prytany
inscriptions are rare (see no. 97).

   <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6820">Athens, EM 6820</rs> + 6820a  440s or 420s   Plate 33
</head>
<p>Three (?) fragments: a (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6820">EM 6820</rs>), found between Theatre
of Dionysos and Odeion of Herodes Atticus, + b (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6820a">EM
6820a</rs>), found in 1859 north of Parthenon. Walbank doubts
that c (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 5409">EM 5409</rs>) belongs. Right edge preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered on right by 0.0175 wide anta. Surface worn, battered. White, medium-grained marble. <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 6820">EM 6820</rs> + 6820a: p.h. 0.22 5, p.w. 0.24, th. 0.06, h. of relief 0.04, h. of letters 0.01.
</p>
<p>The fragmentary inscription is perhaps a grant of
proxeny for the sons of one Iphiades. The ethnic of
Iphiades and his sons is uncertain; Walbank notes
that the name is known in Samos in the fifth century
and in Abydos in the fourth.</p>
<p>All that remains of the relief is the lower right corner
consisting of a fragment of relief ground bordered on
the right by an anta. On analogy with several other
fifth-century stelai with blank spaces above their texts,
it has been suggested that the panel was painted rather
than sculpted, but in all the painted examples the blank
space is flush with the inscribed surface rather than
recessed and bordered by sculpted antae. The figures
would have been centred in the middle of the panel
(cf. nos. 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 28).
</p>
<p>Early dates between 450 and the early 430s have
been suggested on the basis of the letter forms by
Meiggs, Walbank, and Lewis, but Mattingly has argued that some of the names and phrasing place it in the late 420s. Very little of the inscription is preserved and restorations of its dating formula are speculative. The earliest securely dated document relief with
antae is the stele of <dateRange from="-403-07" to="-402-06">403/2</dateRange> honouring the Samians (no.
12), although several others (nos. 11, 67, 74) are probably somewhat earlier. (Cf. nos. 63, 66, reliefs whose
dates also depend upon the resolution of the controversy concerning the datable letter forms of this period.)

6593</rs> (b, found in south-facing wall of Akropolis near

</p>
<p>The decree honours an otherwise unknown Apollonophanes of Kolophon for responsibilities related to
the security of the harbour of Notion. It is generally
accepted that he is being honoured in connection with
events in Kolophon in 427, in which the Athenian
general Paches intervened against the pro-Persian
party besieging the harbour town of Notion and settled loyal Kolophonian refugees there (Thuc. 3.34).
</p>
<p>At the right stands Athena, a combination of the
Parthenos and <term>angelehnte</term> types, with a shield on her
left and a large coiled snake on her right. She rests her
left elbow, now barely visible, on the rim of her shield
and with her right hand crowns the smaller figure of
Apollonophanes who stands on the left, facing Athena
with his right hand raised. There might have been
room for a third figure on the left. The only area of
undamaged drapery reveals the straight, uniformly
rounded folds over Athena's weight leg and the curved
loop extending from the ankle of her free leg that are
characteristic of the peplophoroi of the 420s to the
end of the century (nos. 3, 7, 8); the relative thickness
of the drapery argues for a date close to that of the
Rheitos bridge decree relief (no. 3) and the frieze of
the Nike Temple. (For other versions of the Parthenos,
see nos. 16, 30, 106, 132, 164. For the leaning type,
see nos. 7, 76, 98.)

</head>
<p>Fragment seen in Athens by early 19th-century traveller
William Gell, subsequently taken to Netherlands by Dutch
colonel B. E. A. Rottiers and acquired from him by Rijksmuseum in 1826. Preserves part of top, otherwise broken
all around. Relief bordered above by taenia inscribed
[---]<foreign xml:lang="greek">*o*k*l*s *q</foreign>[---] and ovolo. Surface worn, corroded. p.h.
0.17, p.w. 0.10. Not examined.
</p>
<p>Standing on the left side of the fragment is a female
figure, of whom only the head, arms, and torso are
preserved. She turns in three-quarter view toward the
right and, as the prominence of her left hip indicates,
stands with her weight on her left leg. Her left arm,
broken off at mid-forearm, is extended at shoulder
level toward the right, and her right hand, broken off
at the wrist, is extended downward toward the right.
She wears a peplos with unbelted overfold and a heavy
head-dress like a polos consisting of a round, cushion-like base with a high, flaring crown above it. On
the relief ground just to the right of the head-dress
are the letters <foreign xml:lang="greek">*m*e*s*s</foreign>[<foreign xml:lang="greek">*i?</foreign>---, which usually have been
understood to identify the figure as a personification
of Messenia (cf. no. 120, a personification of Salamis).
Just below her right hand are traces of two letters, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*p*r?</foreign>
</p>
<p>The evidence for dating the fragment is inconclusive. Meritt and Wade-Gery forcefully argued that, owing to the presence of both the three- and four-barred sigma, a date much later than <dateRange from="-446-07" to="-445-06">446/45</dateRange> is to be
excluded; this is the generally accepted date for the
disappearance of the three-barred sigma in Athenian
public inscriptions.
</p>
<p>Proponents of this view have abandoned Wilamowitz's early restoration of the archon Philokles of <dateRange from="-459-07" to="-458-06">459/58</dateRange> in favour of Kirchhoff's restoration of an
unknown secretary, and have assumed that such a
mid-century document must have concerned the
Messenians sealed at Naupaktos rather than Messenia
itself, which was under Spartan control. It has long
been noted, however, that the style of the sculpture
seems much later. In the prominence of her left hip,
the degree of transparency of her drapery, and the
treatment of the V-folds between her breasts, the figure appears to belong between the peplophoroi of the
Parthenon frieze (Brommer, pls. 186, 187) and the
Erechtheion korai (Ridgway, figs. 82, 83), therefore
probably in the 4205 (cf. also no. 3). The style lends
support to the suggestion of Mattingly, following
Woodhead, and an earlier view put forward but ultimately rejected by Michaelis, that the document concerned not the Peloponnesian Messenia but the Sicilian Messana; the Attic form of the name is
Messene. Woodhead had accepted the traditional mid-century date, but Mattingly, a vigorous opponent of
the three-barred sigma rule, associated the relief with
an alliance apparently made between Athens and
Messana in <dateRange from="-427-07" to="-426-06">427/26</dateRange> (Thuc. 3.90.4). Beginning ca. 430
coins of Messana depict a female charioteer, sometimes with the label Messana just before her head, riding in a mule-car (Head, <title>Historia Numorum</title>, 153-54; C. M. Kraay and M. Hirmer, <title>Greek Coins</title> [1966]
pls. 17 fig. 55 0, 18 figs. 56, 57). The figure in the
relief may be the same Messana, her extended hands
holding the reins and urging her animals on (cf. no.
122). Any restoration of the formula identifying the
official on the moulding above her indicates that there
would have been sufficient room on the right side of
the relief for the mules.

<p>The fragmentary decree concerns a sacrifice to Apollo
in Athens. All that remains of the relief are the legs
of two figures standing on either side of the Delphic
omphalos set on a low base between its two golden
eagles. Although only the lower part of the relief is
preserved, Wolters demonstrated that it so closely
resembles the corresponding section of a completely
preserved Attic-style relief in Sparta that it can be
restored with reasonable assurance by reference to it,
assuming that the relief in Sparta is a copy of the
Athenian relief or that both were modelled on the
same source (Sparta Museum inv. 468: P. Wolters,
<title>AM</title> 12 (1887) pl. 12; Hausmann, fig. 35). In the relief
from Sparta the figure on the left is Apollo, turned
toward the right, his weight on his right leg, his left
leg advanced. In his left hand he holds his lyre, in his
extended right hand a phiale. The slightly extended
left leg and the bottom of his drapery are all that are
preserved in the document relief. The figure opposite
him in the Sparta relief is Artemis, turned in three-quarter view toward the left as she pours wine for Apollo's libation with her right hand. She wears a
chiton and himation draped loosely across her abdomen. In the document relief, the crinkly folds of her chiton are visible at the bottom of the relief, and the
lines of the himation, where they can be distinguished
at all, appear to correspond to those in the other relief. Svoronos and Binneboeßel restored a third figure,
Leto, on the far left of the document relief because
the restoration of the inscription indicates that approximately one-third of the relief is missing. Athena, who appears in almost all fifth-century document
reliefs, is another possibility.
</p>
<p>There is very little fresh surface remaining in the
relief from which to judge the style, but the deeply
cut, complex folds of the chiton of Artemis resemble
the drapery of some figures of the Nike Temple frieze
(Blümel, pl. I, figs. 1, 3) and the Nike Temple Parapet
(Carpenter, pl. i). Sokolowski dated the decree <term>ca</term>.
430 on the grounds that mention of the oracle at
Delphi called for a date before the Peloponnesian War
and Spartan influence in Delphi; a date during the
Peace of Nikias, as Hiller and others have proposed,
is more likely. The proposer Philoxenos is usually
identified as the son of Eruxis who was ridiculed in
Attic comedy in the late 420S (Ar. <title>Wasps</title> 84).

<p>Found on Akropolis in 1835. Both edges preserved, back
rough-picked. Original thickness preserved on right side
only. Relief slightly wider than inscription and separated
from it by plain taenia and ovolo. Surface slightly weathered, battered at extreme left. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.395, p.h. of relief 0.16, w. 0.415 (top), 0.38 (bottom), th. 0.102 (top), 0.085 (bottom), relief h. 0.015, h.
of letters 0.017 (lines 1-3), 0.01 (lines 4 ff.).
</p>
<p>The decree is a grant of proxeny to an otherwise
unknown Sotimos of Herakleia and his descendants.
The generally accepted date for the decree of 424 /23
depends upon the restoration of the name Neokleides
as secretary (lines 5-6) and the association of this
man with the Neokleides who appears as secretary in
other decrees of this year (<title>IG</title> J3 36 and 75). On that
basis, West argued that the Herakleia in question was
the wealthy Pontic city that only months before had
become a tributary member of the empire and that
Sotimos might have been honoured for assisting a
ship-wrecked tribute-collecting squadron under
Lamachos in the territory of Herakleia in the summer of 424 (<bibl n="Thuc. 4.75.1-2">Thuc. 4.75.1-2</bibl>; <bibl n="Diod. 12.72.4">Diod. 12.72.4</bibl>). The style
of the relief, however, suggests a later date; the loops
and viscous curves of Athena's drapery are characteristic of the drapery of dated reliefs of <term>ca</term>. 410 (nos. 7,
8) and of the Erechtheion frieze (P.N. Boulter, <title>AntP</title>
10 (1970), pl. 1).
</p>
<p>The relief depicts Sotimos and his city's eponymous hero Herakles standing before a larger figure of Athena seated on a rock at the left. Her shield is
propped up behind her, and she holds her helmet in
her right hand. A similar seated Athena also appears
on the Methone decrees (no. 2), on a number of other
late fifth- and early fourth-century document reliefs
(nos. 11, 71, 87, 90, 91) and on the Nike Temple
Parapet (Carpenter, pls. XIX, XXIV). Immediately to
the right of Athena stands the much smaller Sotimos,
of whom only the lower part of the legs and himation
are preserved. Further right are the nude lower legs
of the slightly larger Herakles. The broad end of his
club rests on the ground at his left and part of his lion
skin can be seen between the club and his left leg (cf.
no. 82). For other possible examples of Herakies as
eponymous hero, see nos. 111, 129, 133, 158.

<head>73. <title>Records of the Sanctuary of Artemis in Brauron</title>
   Brauron, Archaeological Museum i 172 (1058)   <term>ca</term>. 410  Plate 39
</head>
<p>Found in 1961 excavations of sanctuary of Artemis, Brauron.
Top, both edges of relief, and part of left edge of inscription preserved, back rough-picked. Modern rectangular cutting in middle of top and right side of bottom for attachment to wall. Relief bordered above by moulding consisting of plain taenia and ovolo, below by similar, wider
moulding with taenia bearing first line of inscription. Inscribed on relief ground above head of figures on left:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*q*i*l*o*m*i*f*i*l*o*m*e*l*o*s</foreign>. Surface very worn, stained red and
black, with accretions. White, medium-grained marble.
Dimensions unpublished.
</p>
<p>The unpublished fragmentary inscription below the
relief is a catalogue of dedications to Artemis, one of
a number found in the sanctuary of Artemis at
Brauron. On the far right stands Artemis, who turns
slightly toward the left, with her weight on her right
leg and her right hip pushed outward in a stance resembling that of the <term>angelehnte</term> Athena (cf. nos. 7, 65, 76, 98). Her right hand is lowered and extended; she may originally have held a painted oinochoe. She wears
a chiton and himation draped around her abdomen.
Her head slightly overlaps the moulding above the
relief. Approaching her from the left are five smaller,
bearded worshippers, lined up facing her in profile
view. They are probably officials of the sanctuary,
and they are likely to have been named in the inscription below. The letters of uneven size and intervals
inscribed above the heads of the five appear to be an
awkward attempt to identify one of them as Philomelos (cf. no. 83). The men wear himatia and proceed with left feet forward. The first, third, and fifth
figures raise their hands in adoration; the second and
fourth figures appear to hold objects in their lowered
hands.
</p>
<p>The style of the relief, with its broad expanses of
very transparent drapery and evenly spaced, tubular
folds, resembles that of Master B of the Nike Temple
Parapet (Carpenter, pl. VII) and of document reliefs of
ca. 410 (nos. 7, 8).

<p>Provenance unknown. Right edge of relief and moulding,

</p>
<p>On the right side of the relief stand four bearded
men, probably officials being honoured by Athena,
who would have stood in the missing left side of the
relief; the amount of space above the heads of the
figures indicates the presence of a larger figure next
to them. All four men wear himatia. The first is somewhat more frontal and taller than the others. His right
arm is broken off; his left arm hangs at his side. The
figure directly behind him turns in three-quarter view
toward the left; his left hand grasps the bunch of
folds at his waist. The third, more frontal figure is
further right and slightly in front of the second; the
end of his himation is draped over his left arm and
his right arm hangs at his side. The fourth man stands
still further right, slightly behind the third and in
front of the anta. He is turned in near-profile view
toward the left; his right hand is raised to shoulder
height and enveloped in his himation, which is
wrapped around his entire body and thrown back
over his left shoulder.
</p>
<p>Early scholars, probably noting the similarities
between the figures in this relief and some of the
male figures in the Panathenaic procession of the
Parthenon frieze, called this the ‘oldest document
relief’, and some even suggested a Periklean date, but
the resemblance is superficial. The treatment of the
folds and the degree of transparency in the drapery
more closely resemble the style of the relief of the
accounts of the treasurers of Athena of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (no. 8).

Crystalline greyish marble (Vermeule). p.h. 0.34, p.w. 0.21,

</p>
<p>None of the text is preserved. The relief depicts Athena
and another figure of the same scale, of whom only
the right arm and hand are preserved. Athena is
almost frontal, but with her head turned sharply
toward the right. She wears a peplos with belted
overfold, perhaps a shoulder mantle, and an Attic
helmet whose crest slightly overlaps the border above.
Her right arm is held a little away from her body,
perhaps holding the edge of her mantle; the relief is
broken at this point. Her left hand is extended somewhat toward the other figure, but she does not clasp his or her right hand.
</p>
<p>The drapery of Athena is closely comparable to
that of the Athenas of the decree concerning Athens
and Neapolis (no. 7) and the accounts of the treasurers of Athena of <dateRange from="-410-07" to="-419-06">410/9</dateRange> (no. 8). Frel attributed the relief to ‘the Myttion sculptor’, whom he identified as the sculptor of the Telemachos Monument, but the
drapery style of the document relief appears finer,
more transparent.

<p>The inscription records two decrees, the second (lines
9-18) conferring proxeny upon the Abderite Komaios
and his descendants, the first (lines 1-8) ordering the
publication of the second. It is usually dated to the
first quarter of the fourth century by the form of its
prescript, but it could as well date to the years soon
after 375, when Abdera was rescued by Athenian
forces after an invasion of the Triballoi and subsequently became a member of the Second Athenian League. (For  another relief possibly concerning
Abdera, see no. 179.)
</p>
<p>The relief is so worn that only the outline of the
figures is visible. On the right is Athena, preserved
only from the knees down, recognizable by the upright shield leaning toward her on the right. She turns toward the left, probably to crown the smaller
honorand Komaios, preserved only from the calves down, who turns toward her.

<p>The inscription sets forth provisions of an alliance
‘for all time’ between Athens and Korkyra. The document is usually considered a version of the conditions
pertaining to Korkyra resulting from the alliance
concluded between Athens and Korkyra, Akarnania,
and Kephallenia in the second prytany of the
archonship of Hippodamas, <dateRange from="-375-07" to="-374-06">375/74</dateRange> (Ic II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 96), but
the inscription is rare and troublesome in its complete lack of dating formula.
</p>
<p>The relief, which depicts Athena, Zeus, and Hera,
appears to have had more than the usual number of
details added in paint alone, and their disappearance
may have contributed to the confusion over the identities of the figures of Zeus and Hera, often called
Demos and Korkyra. Athena stands on the right, with
her left hand raised and holding her spear, which was
painted. Her right hand hangs down and slightly away
from her side, the fingers separated as though holding her shield, which must also have been added in
paint. She wears her himation draped diagonally from
under her right arm over her left shoulder, covering
most of her body. The crest of her Corinthian helmet
would also have been painted, overlapping the architrave above her. On the left side of the relief Zeus
and Hera turn toward each other. Zeus sits with his
right hand hanging down at his side, his left hand
resting on his thigh. His seat, which is now merely a
projection of the smooth surface of the anta behind
him, must originally have been distinguished from it
with paint. He may also have held a painted attribute
such as a thunderbolt (no. 24), or there may have
been a painted eagle in the large empty space by his
seat (cf. no.
</p>
<p>Hera stands very close to Zeus in a somewhat
awkward position probably intended to show torsion
in the upper body; her legs are turned slightly toward
the right, her torso is frontal, and her shoulders and
head are turned toward the left. She wears a peplos
and a mantle draped over her head and extended in
her right hand in the bridal gesture of unveiling. Hera's
identity is established by her dress, position, and gesture, which are traditional for Hera and which indicate an intimate relationship to Zeus (cf. nos. 5, 24, perhaps 41), and by her scale relative to Athena, characteristics which at the same time argue against the
usual identification of the figure as Korkyra. Although
place personifications are occasionally found in document reliefs (nos. 66, 120), patron deities representing
their cities are much more common. The cult of Hera
Akraia was the most important of Korkyra (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.24">Thuc.
1.24</bibl>; 3.75, 79-81; <bibl n="Diod. 22.48">Diod. 22.48</bibl>), while the only evidence for representations of Korkyra are Pausanias' reference (<bibl n="Paus. 5.22.6">Paus. 5.22.6</bibl>) to her as part of a group of Zeus
and Asopos with his daughters at Olympia and a rf.
pyxis depicting her in the pursuit of her sister Aigina
by Zeus (<title>LIMC</title> VI, 103 no. 7, s.v. Korkyra). The
presence of Zeus on Korkyra is attested by a fourth-century votive relief dedicated to Zeus Meilichios
(A. Spetsieri-Choremi, <title>All Corfu</title> (1988) fig. p. 16), but
his role in the document relief is probably primarily
as consort to Hera.
</p>
<p>The relief is a good example of a sculptor's use of models taken from different periods. The figures of
Zeus and Hera are based upon late fifth-century types
(cf. no. 5). This is particularly clear in the sharp distinction of Hera's transparently draped right leg from
her heavily covered left leg and in the billowing of
her veil. The figure of Athena, on the other hand, has
the more voluminous drapery of the figure of the
alliance with Chios (no. 19) of <dateRange from="-384-07" to="-383-06">384/83</dateRange>, as well as the
sturdier stance and reflective quality of the Athena
Rospigliosi (Binneboeßel, 54; G. B. Waywell, <title>BSA</title> 66
(1971) 373-80, pls. 67, 71b); the broad, sweeping lines
of her himation resemble the drapery of the latter
work. Walbank attributes this inscription to the
mason of no. 14, but the reliefs are not the work of
the same sculptor.

<p>Four joining fragments, all from Akropolis. Part of left edge

</p>
<p>The inscription is a dedication of the <term>prytaneis</term> of
Kekropis after they had been voted the best <term>prytaneis</term>
of the year. It was probably dedicated in the <term>heroon</term>
of Kekrops on the Akropolis. On the left stands
Athena, her right hand resting on the rim of her shield.
Her missing left hand was probably raised and held
a painted spear. She wears a Corinthian helmet and a
himation thrown over her left shoulder. Next to her
on the right is Nike, preserved only from the waist
down; the bottom of her wing is visible against the
relief ground behind her. She turns in three-quarter
view toward the right, probably crowning the small
male figure next to her, who represents the <term>prytaneis</term>.
His nude legs suggest that he wore a short chiton,
dress inappropriate for the <term>prytaneis</term> but suitable for
victors in military contests (cf. no. 150). Behind him
on the right is their prize, a large hydria, and above
and behind it two horizontal lines, perhaps the top of
an altar. The restored width of the inscription indicates that there was enough room on the right for another figure, perhaps Kekrops (cf. no. 138).
</p>
<p>The style of Athena's drapery, in particular the
broad and simplified yet still clinging expanse of her
himation, resembles that of the figure on the Athenian alliance with Chios of <dateRange from="-384-07" to="-383-06">384/83</dateRange> (no. 19), of Athena on the relief of the alliance with Korkyra of <term>ca</term>. 375 (no. 96), and of an unidentified female figure in a
relief from a document that concerned Aphytis (no.
104). Meritt and Traill suggested a date in the second
quarter of the century because one of the <term>prytaneis</term>
listed participated in the dedication of a statue of
Aphrodite shortly before 360 (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 2820</bibl>, line 5).

<p>Found on South Slope in excavations of 1876-77. Left edge,
part of top preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered
on left by anta, above by plain pediment with side akrotenon. Taenia inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*d*i*i*p*o*s*m*u</foreign>[---] and ovolo separate

</p>
<p>Only a few letters of a name in the first line of the
inscription and the left side of the relief are preserved.
Athena turns toward the right, leaning with her right
elbow on her shield, which stands on a step. Her
raised left hand holds her spear out in front of her.
Her right hand holds the end of her mantle, which is
draped over her left shoulder and brought around
under her right arm, cushioning it from the rim of the
shield. The direction of Athena's attention and the
restoration of the heading require at least one other
figure in the missing right side of the relief.
</p>
<p>The leaning Athena was a popular late fifth- and
early fourth-century type (nos. 7, 65), and the drapery of this figure retains some of the doughy transparency characteristic of early fourth-century drapery (cf. no. 14), but the figure's tall, slim proportions and
her more languorous, almost unstable pose (cf. no.
24) make a somewhat later date in the second quarter
of the century more likely.

<p>Found in April 1938 among marbles collected near south

</p>
<p>The fragmentary inscription concerns an agreement
between Athens and Siphnos regarding punishment
in cases involving Athenians at Siphnos. At the left
are the lower legs of a female figure, perhaps Athena,
seated on a rock facing right. She sits with her right
leg slightly extended, her left leg drawn back. Coming from beneath her himation are traces of her peplos.
Woodhead thought that the agreement might be related to similar <term>symbolai</term> with Keos and Naxos in the
years before or after the Social War. A date even earlier
in the second quarter of the century is also possible
for a document concerning a member of the Second
Athenian League (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 43</bibl>, l. 126). The rounded,
doughy folds of the drapery call for a date no more
specific than the first half of the fourth century (cf.
nos. 14, 16, 18).

<p>Found in 1840 excavations at south wing of Propylaia. Top,
both edges of relief, part of right edge of inscription preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered by tapering
0.05-0.055 wide antac supporting 0.06 high entablature,

</p>
<p>The very fragmentary inscription is an honorary decree, apparently for a man from Kroton. On the right stands an Athena of the Parthenos type, turned slightly toward the left (cf. nos. 16, 30, 65, 106, 164). In her
extended right hand she holds a small, frontal Nike,
with wings extended and right hand raised. Athena's
left hand rests on the rim of her shield. On the ground
beneath her extended arm is a large, coiled snake.
Opposite her on the left is a bearded figure of the
same scale who leans on a staff held crutch-like under
his arm. His right hand rests on his hip. His large
scale indicates that he is not the mortal honorand, but
either Demos, whose type he resembles and who is
also shown leaning on a staff in other document reliefs (cf. nos. 117, 150), or more probably Asklepios, an appropriate representative for Kroton, a city famous for its doctors (Hdt. 3.13 I; cf. Svoronos, pls. 35
(<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1345">NM 1345</rs>), 38 (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1334">NM 1334</rs>), votive reliefs with similar
figures of Asklepios); the snake is an attribute of
Asklepios as well as of Athena.
</p>
<p>The contrast between Athena's hidden weight leg
and her nearly profile free leg is common in the mid-fourth century (cf. nos. 28, 29), but her high waistline is more characteristic of figures of the third quarter
of the century (cf. nos. 36, 40, 46).

<p>Nothing remains of the body on the inscription, but
the apparent traces of the invocation <term>theoi</term> on the frame
of the relief suggest that it belonged to a public document, probably an honorary decree. All three figures preserved in the relief, Athena, Herakles, and Demos, are identified by labels on the entablature above them.
On the right, Herakles, probably the hero of the
honorand's home (cf. nos. 72, 111, 129, i58), turns
slightly toward the left and with his right hand places
a crown on Athena's head. Although deities and heroes usually crown mortals in document reliefs, the figure of Athena crowning Ares in a roughly contemporary deme decree of Acharnai (no. 143) provides at
least one other parallel for the crowning of a deity,
and on the Athenian anti-tyranny law of <dateRange from="-337-07" to="-336-06">337/36</dateRange> the
personification of Demos is crowned by Demokratia
(no. 38). Herakles' left hand rests on his club held at
his hip; his lion skin is draped over his forearm. Athena
is also turned toward the left. Her raised right hand
held her painted spear. She wears a peplos, aegis with
gorgoneion, and a helmet. Her left hand rests on the
rim of her shield. Still further left is the seated figure
of Demos, facing left as well; only his upper torso is
preserved (cf. nos. 38, 167). He is turned forward in
his chair so that his upper body is seen in three-quarter view; his left arm rests on the back of the chair. The direction of all three figures' attention
indicates that there must have been at least one more
figure, probably an honorand, further to the left.
</p>
<p>The tall, slim proportions of the figures and
Athena's high waistline in particular call for a date in
the third quarter of the fourth century (cf. nos. 36,
40, 46).

<p>The subject of the relief indicates that it came from
an honorary decree. On the right stands Athena; only
her head, torso, and arms are preserved. She turns
slightly toward the left and with her right hand crowns
a smaller figure who is not preserved. Her left hand,
broken off at the wrist, probably rested on the rim of
her shield. She wears a peplos and an aegis without
gorgoneion draped diagonally over her right shoulder and under her left arm (for this type see no. 140). The high placement of her belt and the weight and
thickness of the drapery place the relief in the third
quarter of the fourth century (cf. nos 36, 38, 40).

</p>
<p>The subject of the relief suggests that its lost inscription was an honorary decree. On the far left the figure identified by inscribed label as Boule turns slightly toward the right. Her left hand is raised to shoulder
height and holds the edge of the himation she wears
like a veil over her head. The same arrangement of
drapery, continuing over the right upper arm and held
with a triangular overfold at the waist, also occurs on
another figure in a document relief (no. 49), who is
accompanied by Demos and is therefore almost certainly also Boule. Next to her on the right is Athena, also turned slightly toward the right. Her raised left
hand holds her spear; her right hand is propped on
her hip. She wears a peplos, aegis with gorgoneion, a
shoulder mantle, and Corinthian helmet. Both figures
direct their attention toward the small male figure in
a himation, probably the honorand of the missing
inscription, turned toward them on the right. He raises
his right hand in adoration. To judge from the remains of the pediment above the relief, there would have been room for at least one more figure, almost
certainly Demos, on the far right; Boule is very unlikely to have been depicted without him.
</p>
<p>Although the spelling Bole for Boule generally dies
out after the middle of the fourth century, the thick,
coarse folds of the drapery with interior creases and
the tall, high-waisted figures argue for a date in the
third quarter of the fourth century (cf. nos. 38, 40, 46, 49).

letters 0.004-0.006 (line 1), 0.009 (line 2), 0.006 (lines 3ff.).
</p>
<p>The decree of the deme Acharnai concerns the construction of altars to Ares and Athena Areia at their
sanctuary in Acharnai, which is where the stele was
probably originally set up; no. 177, which was found
with it, was dedicated by the priest of the sanctuary.
The relief depicts Athena crowning Ares, who is
shown in hoplite armour (cf. nos. 125, reportedly
found in Acharnai, and no. 139, from Athens, which
probably also depict Ares). There are at least two
parallels in document reliefs for the motif of deities
or personifications crowning others of their rank (nos.
38, 133). Athena stands on the right and turns slightly
toward the left. She wears a short-sleeved chiton,
peplos, aegis with gorgoneion, and an Attic helmet.
With her right hand she places a crown on Ares' head.
Her left hand rests on the rim of her shield. Ares is
a beardless figure of the same scale who turns slightly
toward Athena. He wears a short chiton, cuirass, and
a chlamys draped over both shoulders, and he once
held a painted spear in his raised right hand. His left
hand rests on his shield.
</p>
<p>The  tall, slim,  high-waisted figures, the flat,
unrevealing drapery with its straight, sharply etched
folds, the coarse featured heads, and the flat frame of
the relief are characteristic of a number of document
reliefs from the third quarter of the fourth century
(cf. nos. 36, 38, 145-148). The figure types particularly resemble those of the relief of <dateRange from="-340-07" to="-339-06">340/39</dateRange> honouring Phokinos, Nikandros, and Dexippos (no. 36), but the
clear differences in the quality of the two reliefs
suggest a workshop relationship rather than the presence of a single hand. The Athena, however, is so close to the Athena of no. 144 that the two reliefs
may have been the work of the same sculptor.

<p>The very fragmentary inscription concerns honours
for the Poimenidai and other Megalopolitans. On the
right stands Athena, preserved only from the hips up,
turning slightly toward the left. She wears a peplos,
aegis, and Attic helmet. Her right arm, broken off
just below the elbow, was extended, perhaps to crown
one or more of the honorands on the left. The opaque
drapery with sharply cut lines radiating from Athena's
belt is characteristic of the plainer drapery style that
begins in the middle of the fourth century (cf. nos.
28, 29). The Athena type, the low relief, and flat frame
link the relief with several others from the middle to
the third quarter of the century (nos. 36, 143), of
which no. 143 may be by the same hand.

<p>Two (?) non-joining fragments: <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 2958">NM 2958</rs> (with relief), from
Akropolis, <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 7166">EM 7166</rs> (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 417</bibl>), found in 1839 west of

wide anta supporting 0.035 high entablature, below by 0.045
wide moulding consisting of taenia and ovolo. Architrave
inscribed: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*e*u*t*a*c*i*a</foreign>. Surface slightly worn, chipped. White,

</p>
<p>The moulding and the continuation of the stele below it indicate that the relief belonged to an inscription, but it is uncertain whether its usual association
with <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 417</bibl>, a list of two men from each <term>phyle</term>
concerned with a liturgy called the <term>eutaxia</term>, is correct.
</p>
<p>The female figure on the right is identified by the
inscribed label on the architrave above as Eutaxia, a
personification of the discipline of the military and
the gymnasium, a quality particularly associated with
the ephebes. By the late fourth century it was also a
term for a liturgy, which Palagia interpreted as sponsorship of a festival event involving armed contestants (<title>JHS</title> 95 [1975] 181-82). Eutaxia is frontal, her head turned in near-profile view toward the left. Her
weight has shifted to her left leg in such a way that
her left hip swings outward emphatically. She wears
a high-girt chiton with shoulder cords and a himation
with a triangular overfold draped low across her torso.
Her right hand is raised and points toward the left. In
her left hand she holds a broken, unidentified object.
</p>
<p>Further left is a male figure of the same scale, also
wearing a himation with triangular overfold, who leans
on a staff held crutch-like under his left arm. His
right arm, completely broken off, was raised and
probably crowned the smaller male figure on the left.
His head is entirely broken away but appears to have
been inclined toward the honorand. Kron suggested
that the figure is a <term>phyle</term> hero because the <term>eutaxia</term> was
a <term>phyle</term> responsibility, but because the liturgists for
all ten <term>phylai</term> were listed in <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 417</bibl>, the figure is
more likely to be Demos (cf. nos. 49, 54, 117, 126,
150, 172, possibly nos. 23, 45).
</p>
<p>On the far left is a much smaller male figure whose
upper body and head are broken away. He wears a
short chiton and a mantle draped over his left arm;
his left hand rests on the rim of his shield. If the relief
belongs with <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 417</bibl>, this figure should represent
the victors being honoured by Demos and Eutaxia;
his dress and the tripod mounted on a column in the
background refer to the contest. Cf. the similar relief
from a dedication of victorious <term>prytaneis</term> (no. 97), in
which a single figure represents the <term>prytaneis</term> and a
hydria in the background represents their prize.
</p>
<p>The very high-waisted, pear-shaped figure of
Eutaxia, her torsion, and the pronounced outward
swing of the hips of both Demos and Eutaxia are
characteristic of reliefs of the last quarter of the fourth
century (cf. nos. 47, 49). Palagia has noted the close
resemblance of the two male figures to figures in no.
149. As she pointed out, if the relief concerns a liturgy, it should date before Demetrios of Phaleron abolished the festival liturgies between <dateRange from="-317-07" to="-316-06">317/16</dateRange> and
<dateRange from="-309-07" to="-308-06">309/8</dateRange>.

next to him on the right turns toward the right. At
the broken right edge of the fragment is the foot of
an apparently smaller figure, perhaps an honorand,
turned toward the left. The identity and relationship
of the figures are unclear; there should have been
something on the the left side of the relief engaging
the attention of the figure who has turned in that
direction. The relief is too crude and fragmentary to
be dated by its style, but its <term>handwerkliche</term> quality
would not be out of place toward the end of the
fourth century (cf. nos. 43, 45).

<p>Two joining fragments of complete stele: upper fragment
found in Eleusis in 1883 excavations of Greek Archaeological Society; lower fragment found in Eleusis in 1888. Relief
bordered above by plain taenia and moulding, together 0.045

</p>
<p>The decree, set up by the deme of Eleusis, honours
Smikythion for his services to the deme as <term>peripolarchos</term> or patrol commander and awards him a gold
crown. The demarch is charged with the responsibility of having the decree inscribed and set up in an
appropriate location (lines 27-31). Smikythion is
shown as a small bearded figure standing on the far
right, his right hand raised in adoration; his left hand
holds the end of his himation. He looks toward the
much larger figures of Demeter and Kore on the left.
Demeter, facing left, sits on a <term>kiste</term>. She wears a chiton
and himation. Her right hand holds the extended left
hand of Kore, standing before her on the left, or
perhaps they held a painted crown between them.
Kore is a nearly frontal figure holding a torch in her
right hand. She wears a chiton and over it a himation
completely covering her body and knotted under her
left arm. Demeter and Kore resemble the figures on
a decree of Eleusis honouring Derkylos of Hagnous
(no.  127), on votive reliefs, and on Panathenaic amphorae, all apparently dating from the second half of the fourth century. No. 34, an Athenian decree from
Eleusis, also depicts Demeter seated on a <term>kiste</term>. The
positions of the figures relative to each other vary,
but the figure types are similar and perhaps derived
from an Eleusinian cult group, as Kern and Jucker
have suggested. The very high-waisted proportions
of the figures and the generalized treatment of their
heavy drapery call for a date in the last quarter of the
fourth century (cf. nos. 45, 150, 153).

<p>Found near Hephaisteion in 1891 construction of Athens-Piraeus railway. Top, both edges of relief, and right edge of

wide antae supporting 0.055  high entablature with antefixes,
architrave inscribed: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*a*m*f*i*a*r*a*o*s *a*r*t*i*k*l*e*i*d*h*s *u*g*i*e*i*a</foreign>. Below, 0.0375 wide moulding inscribed [<foreign xml:lang="greek">*q*e*o</foreign>. Surface worn, flaked, with dark stains, accretions. White, medium-grained

0.007.
</p>
<p>All that remains of the inscription is a fragmentary
heading, but the relief indicates that it is an honorary
decree for an otherwise unknown Artikleides, probably for his services to the cult of Amphiaraos. On
the right stands Hygieia, who turns slightly toward
the left and with her right hand places a crown on
Artikleides' head. In her left hand she holds an
oinochoe. She wears a high-girt chiton and himation
with a triangular overfold. The much smaller figure
of Artikleides stands behind a low altar. His right
arm, broken off at the elbow, is extended and may
have held a phiale. His association with the altar lends
some support to Kutsch's suggestion that he was a
priest. On the other side of the altar is Amphiaraos,
who leans on a staff held crutch-like under his left
arm. His right hand, broken off at the wrist, is extended and may also have held a phiale. His himation is wrapped around his left arm and crosses his torso
with a triangular overfold. The figure closely resembles an Asklepios-like type for Amphiaraos represented by two fragmentary fourth-century statues
found at the Amphiaraion at Oropos (B. Petrakos,
<title>Ho Oropos kai to Hieron tou Amphiaraou</title> (1968) 120
nos. 10, 11, pls. 34b, 35a; cf. also no. 132.). The statue
of Amphiaraos that Pausanias (1.8.2) saw in the Agora
may also have been of this familiar type and could
have provided the model for the relief, which its find-spot suggests was erected nearby. (Cf. <rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, NM 1383">NM 1383</rs>, Svoronos, pl. 38.4, a fragmentary votive relief depicting Hygieia that was found at the same time.)
</p>
<p>Although the inscription has been dated to the first
half of the fourth century on the basis of its letter
forms, the very tall, slim proportions of the figures,
the very high-waisted Hygieia, and the emphatic
outward swing of Amphiaraos' hip suggest a date in
the last quarter of the fourth century. The three figures resemble the honorand, Demos, and Boule in
the more crudely worked relief of the honorary decree for Asklepiodoros (no. 49) dated <dateRange from="-323-07" to="-322-06">323/22</dateRange>, and the
stance of Amphiaraos is also close to that of Deloptes
in the decree of the <term>orgeones</term> of Bendis of <dateRange from="-329-07" to="-328-06">329/28</dateRange> (no.

<p>The decree of the deme Aixone honours Auteas son
of Autokles and Philoxenides son of Philippos, successful <term>choregoi</term> for their <term>choregia</term> in the local Dionysia,
and awards each of them a 100-drachmai gold crown.
The stele was to have been set up in the local theatre
(lines  11-13 The relief depicts a young satyr carrying
an oinochoe toward a seated figure of Dionysos, who
holds a kantharos in his right hand. The satyr is depicted as a nude boy with a short tail. The youthful
Dionysos sits on a rock, with his left hand raised and
holding a sceptre. A long lock of hair hangs down
over his left shoulder, and he wears a wreath. Carved
in low relief on the architrave above the relief panel
are five comic masks.
</p>
<p>The decree was  passed  in  the archonship   of
Theophrastos, but whether this is the archon of <dateRange from="-340-07" to="-339-06">340/39</dateRange> or of <dateRange from="-313-07" to="-312-06">313/12</dateRange> is not specified. Its editors accepted
the later date to which for prosopographical reasons
Kirchner assigned the contemporary decree from
Aixone that has the same archon, proposer, and
demarch (no. 155); the only other choregic decrees
from Aixone are dated <dateRange from="-326-07" to="-325-06">326/25</dateRange> and <dateRange from="-317-07" to="-316-06">317/16</dateRange> (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
1198</bibl>, 1200). Webster, however, has since argued for
the earlier date because the masks on the architrave
more closely resemble those of Middle than of New
Comedy. He also cited prosopographical arguments
to counter those for the later date, but they are not
conclusive. The style of the relief, with its stiff drapery and poorly articulated anatomy, is more consistent with the later date, although its frame with
flattened anta capitals resembles those of a group of
somewhat earlier reliefs (nos. 38, 143-148). It is not
by the same hand as no. 155.

</p>
<p>The deme of Aixone honours Kallikrates son of
Glaukon and Aristokrates son of Aristophanes for
their service to the deme. The decree was to have
been set up by the deme in the theatre of Aixone
(lines 18-21), which was the site of an active rural
Dionysia (see also no. 154 and <bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1198</bibl> and 1200).
The subject of the relief and the location of the stele
suggest that the honours were related to the festival.
Whitehead's suggestion that these were the <term>choregoi</term>
who lost to Auteas and Philoxenides (no. 154) in the
festival's competition is unconvincing because Kallikrates and Aristokrates are awarded the more expensive 500-drachmai wreaths.
</p>
<p>Two figures face each other on either side of a small
altar. The figure on the left, whose head is missing, is
a satyr or silenos whose furry body is visible above
and below his himation. Meyer suggested that his goat-like character was intended as a play on the name
Aixone; the Greek word for goat is <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ic</foreign> The figure
steps toward the altar and with his right hand prepares to pour from an oinochoe into the kantharos
held by the other, larger figure, probably Dionysos,
who is preserved only from the waist down. He wears
a himation and in his left hand holds an object which
may be his thyrsos. Other traces of relief at the upper
edge of this fragment have been interpreted as a scroll,
but it is difficult to see how this would be held, and
these may instead be traces of drapery thrown over
the figure's shoulder. The large krater in the left corner of the relief, appropriate for its function as a wine-mixing bowl, probably represents a prize in the Dionysia's dramatic competition (cf. no. 97).
</p>
<p>The decree dates from the archonship of Theophrastos and thus from either <dateRange from="-340-07" to="-339-06">340/39</dateRange> or <dateRange from="-313-07" to="-312-06">313/12</dateRange>. Köhler in
<title>IG</title> II and Kirchner following him in <title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> chose the
later date largely for prosopographical reasons: a
brother of the proposer Glaukides is mentioned in a
catalogue of <term>ca</term>. 320 (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1955</bibl>; <title>KirchPA</title> 12784),
and Aristokrates himself proposed a decree in honour of Demetrios of Phaleron in 317 (<bibl><title>IG</title> II<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 1201</bibl>).
Webster, however, has argued for the earlier date for
no.  54, which was passed at the same time, primarily
on the basis of the style of the relief, the types of
masks depicted on its architrave, and some inconclusive prosopographical arguments. The drapery of the figures and the emphatic swing in the satyr's stance suggest that the later date is the more likely (cf. nos.
47, 49).

<p>Found in 1866 near port of Zea in Piraeus. Both edges, top
preserved, broken (?) bottom set in plaster, back smooth.
Stele capped by 0.04 high moulding consisting of rough
taenia and ovolo. Unbordered relief panel in upper right

</p>
<p>The inscription is a lease in which Eukrates, son of
Exekias of Aphidna, rents a shop and outbuildings in
Piraeus from eight Kytherian meritai, probably officials of the Attic deme of Kytheros rather than the distant island Kythera. The stele was to have been set
up ‘by the hero’ (lines 24-25), presumably the statue
of the hero for whom the Philippides of lines 1-2 was
priest.
</p>
<p>The relief is very unusual in its position in the upper
right corner of the stele. On the right is a bearded (?)
figure, probably the same hero, seated on a chair
turned toward the left. In his extended right hand he
holds a kantharos. Opposite him on the left is a standing female figure. In her right hand she holds an
oinochoe, preparing to pour from it into the
kantharos. The lack of specific designations for the
priest and the hero in the document suggest that
they were well known to all concerned and that the
figures are representations of the hero and perhaps
the heroine of a local cult. Libation scenes are commonly found on votive reliefs dedicated to heroes
(B. Mitropoulou, <title>Libation Scene with Oinochoe in
Votive Reliefs</title> [1975]); in this context the libation may
refer to an oath and libation with which the business
of the lease was concluded.
</p>
<p>The very tall proportions, the high-waisted female
figure (cf. nos. 45, 150, 553), and the superficial, generalized workmanship are characteristics of late fourth-century relief. The composition and the very flat, summary execution of the figures suggest that the
relief was carved by a sculptor of minor grave stelai
and marble lekythoi (cf. Schmaltz, pls. 41, 44).

<p>Found in 1922 in house foundations in neighbourhood of
Dourgouti, south of Fix brewery and on left bank of Ilissos.
Broken at bottom of inscription, back rough-picked. Relief
bordered by tapering 0.035-0.042 wide antae, above by
pediment, below by plain taenia and flattened ovolo, together 0.045 wide. Surface very worn, chipped, with red-brown iron stains. White, medium-grained marble. p.h. 0.63, h. of relief 0.36, w. 0.36 (relief), 0.31 (inscription), th. 0.10

</p>
<p>The decree records the honours of the elder <term>epilektoi</term>,
members of an elite corps of the infantry, of the <term>phyle</term>
Antiochis for their taxiarch Prokleides; he is given a
gold crown. On the right stands the nude frontal figure of Herakles, whose head is slightly turned toward the left. His right hand holds the top of his
club; its lower end rests on a rock. His lion skin is
draped over his left forearm (cf. no. 158). Opposite
him is a bearded figure wearing a himation who probably represents his son Antiochos; his large scale indicates that he is not the mortal honorand, and the
eponymous hero of the <term>phyle</term> bestowing the honours
is the most appropriate identification. His raised left
hand held a painted spear or staff. His right hand
rests on his hip. No standard type for Antiochos
emerges from known representations of him, but
E. B. Harrison has pointed out that in at least two
vase paintings he is shown with his hand on his hip
(‘Eponymous Heroes’, 78). Herakles is probably
present in the relief not only as the father of Antiochos
but also because the <term>heroon</term> of Antiochos was apparently associated with or even in the Herakles sanctuary in Kynosarges. This decree is one of at least three of Antiochis (<title>SEG</title> 3.115-17) found in the area of the
south bank of the Ilissos where the Herakleion is
believed to have been located, one of which (<title>SEG</title>
3.115) was to have been set up in the <term>heroon</term>. See also
no. 145, a document relief found there that must also
represent Antiochos.
</p>
<p>The squat figures with their large, almost caricatured
facial features and the stiff, straight drapery folds are
characteristic of the sometimes <term>handwerkliche</term> quality
of document reliefs in the second half of the fourth
century (cf. nos. 36, 43, 45). The pose of Herakles,
with his hip swung outward, suggests a date toward
the end of the century (cf. nos. 46, 47, 49). For other
<term>phyle</term> decrees, see nos. 53, 107, 128, 138, possibly 148.

<p>From Akropolis. Part of left edge of relief and moulding
preserved, back rough-picked. Relief bordered on left by
0.03 wide anta, below by taenia with first line of inscription
and ovolo, together 0.045 wide. Surface very worn, flaked,

</p>
<p>The decree, of which only part of the first line is
preserved, is apparently a grant of proxeny for a man
whose name has been restored as Sostratos. On the
left stands the frontal figure of Herakles, probably
the hero of the honorand's home (cf. nos. 72, 111,
129, 133), leaning on the small end of his club held at
his hip with his right hand; the other end rests on a
rock. His lion skin is draped over his left arm (cf. no.
 57). On the right is a female figure of the same scale,
probably Athena, of whom only the contour and
lower part of the right leg are preserved. She held her
spear in her right hand and probably turned toward
the honorand, who would have been in the missing
right side of the relief. The emphatic outward swing
of his hip is common in figures in the last quarter of
the fourth century (cf. nos. 47, 49).

<p>According to Wilhelm, the very fragmentary inscription apparently concerned the leasing of a temenos. Because its orator lacks both patronymic and demotic, Henry suggested that it was a tribal or deme decree.
Kirchner in <title>IG</title> dated the inscription to the end of the
fourth century. Two male feet were all that remain of
the relief.

<p>None of the inscription is preserved, but the subject
of the relief indicates that it belonged to an honorary
decree. All that remains is the right arm of a figure,
perhaps Athena, extending a crown toward the left
where the honorand must once have stood. Walter
believed that the deeply cut contours around the relief indicated unfinished work.

<p>The body of the inscription is not preserved. On the

are no folds of an undergarment showing beneath
the himation. He appears to be leaning somewhat
forward, with his right hand resting on the rocky seat.
The figure is too worn for even an approximate dating.

<p>Four fragments: a (<rs key="Perseus:object:Athens, EM 8043">EM 8043</rs> + 8044 + 8045) found in

</p>
<p>The partially preserved decree is apparently a reaffirmation for Telesias of Troizen of the Athenian citizenship previously given to one of his ancestors.
Although the decree is securely dated to the eighth
prytany of the archonship of Hagnotheos (line 9),
<dateRange from="-140-07" to="-139-06">140/39</dateRange>, Osborne suggested that the monument itself
may be considerably later, for in some of the crowns
below the text are records of Telesias' positions in
Athenian state religion that he could not have held
without citizenship.
</p>
<p>The relief refers particularly to Telesias' Athenian
citizenship. The only surviving example of mythological narrative in a document relief, it depicts
Theseus lifting the rock which covered the <term>gnorismata</term>
by which he would prove his own Athenian citizenship, an event that took place in his youth in Troizen. In the centre of the relief the nude Theseus turns
toward the right and pushes against a tall, oblong
rock, revealing on the ground beneath it the sword
and shoes of his father Aigeus, king of Athens. There
was a bronze statue of Theseus lifting the rock on the
Akropolis (<bibl n="Paus. 1.27.8">Paus. 1.27.8</bibl>), and the deed is also depicted
in vase painting. Although the stele is ambitious in
size and ornament, the relief itself is crudely cut, the
anatomy distorted, and the shoes and sword barely
recognizable.
