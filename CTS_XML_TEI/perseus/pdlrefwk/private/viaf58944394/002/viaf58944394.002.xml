        <p>Beazley called the Kleophrades Painter the greatest pot-painter of the Late Archaic
          period, giving him precedence over his contemporary, the Berlin Painter, an artist whose
          best works are among the masterpieces of Attic vase-painting.<note anchored="true" n="1">

              black-figure work, see <bibl>Kunze-Götte 1992</bibl>.</p>
          </note> The two painters are frequently compared and discussed in tandem, but although
          they shared a common background and were close in their early careers, they possessed
          different temperaments and developed markedly different styles. Of the Kleophrades
          Painter, Beazley remarked that "he may be said to play a kind of Florentine to the Berlin
          Painter's Sienese."<note anchored="true" n="2">
            <p><bibl>Beazley 1918, 40-41</bibl>.</p>
          </note> Although this statement says as much about Beazley as it does the Kleophrades
          Painter, there can be no doubt what he meant. He was a painter of power, whose vital,
          robust figures, whether naked, armored, or swathed in luxurious drapery, are imbued with
          intelligence and will. The firm lines and clear compositions of his paintings were founded
          on careful designs, worked out in extensive preliminary sketches.<note anchored="true"
            n="3">
            <p>For example, the satyr holding a shield on the neck-amphora <rs
                key="Perseus:object:Harrow 55" type="vase">Harrow 55</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 183,
              11</bibl>) was originally sketched holding a cuirass; see <bibl>P. E. Corbett,
                "Preliminary Sketch in Greek Vase-Painting," <title>JHS</title> 85 (1965) 16-28
                (Harrow amphora: pls. IIb and III)</bibl>. On another amphora of this type, <rs
                key="Perseus:object:Villa Giulia 47836" type="vase">Villa Giulia 47836</rs>
                (<bibl>ARV2, 184, 18</bibl>), the youth on the obverse was sketched holding a hare
              for the boy on the reverse, but the gift was omitted in the final drawing.</p>
          </note> In his earliest works, from the last decade of the sixth century, the influence of
          Euthymides is strong, and there can be no doubt that the Kleophrades Painter trained under
          him in the Pioneer workshop, where he would also have been exposed to the works of
          Phintias and Euphronios. The Berlin Painter had a similar training, though he was perhaps
          closer to Phintias than to Euthymides, whose influence on the Kleophrades Painter is so
          great that Beazley originally attributed to the older painter some works he later assigned
          to the pupil.<note anchored="true" n="4">
            <p>E.g. two very early psykters: <rs key="Perseus:object:Louvre G 57" type="vase">Louvre
                G 57</rs> and <rs key="Perseus:object:Compigne 1068" type="vase"
                >Compiègne 1068</rs>; <bibl>Beazley 1925, 64, nos. 8 and 7</bibl>;
                <bibl>ARV2, 188, 65-66</bibl>. It was Richter who, when she attributed the Harvard
              calyx-krater to the Kleophrades Painter (discussed below), recognized that the
              psykters must also be his (see <bibl>Richter 1936</bibl>). For Euthymides, see
                <bibl>ARV2, 26-30 and 1620-21</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 323-24, 509, and 520</bibl>;
                <bibl>Beazley Addenda 2, 155-56</bibl>; <bibl>Hoppin 1917</bibl>; <bibl>L. Talcott,
                "A Stand signed by Euthymides," <title>Hesperia</title> 5 (1936) 59-69</bibl>;
                <bibl>M. Wegner, <title>Euthymides und Euphronios</title> (Münster

                (Stuttgart 1990)</bibl>.</p>
          </note> His career lasted over thirty years, ending in the late 470s, before the Berlin
          Painter's latest works, which are so poor that one is thankful the Kleophrades Painter
          quit when he did.</p>

        <head>Identity</head>

        <p>The Kleophrades Painter was named by Beazley after a potter's signature in black glaze on
          the foot of a kylix in Paris (<rs key="Perseus:object:Paris, Cab. Md. 535/699" type="vase"
            >Paris, Cab. Méd. 535/699</rs>; <bibl>ARV2, 191, 103</bibl>). The fragmentary
          inscription was restored by Jan Six as <foreign xml:lang="xgreek">Kleophrades epoiesen amasios
            huus</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*L*E*O*F*R*A*D*E*S *E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N
            *A*M*A*S[*I*O*S &epig-rough;*U*U]*S</foreign>, "Kleophrades, the son of Amasis, made
            it").<note anchored="true" n="5">

                >&epig-rough;uio/s</foreign>, "son."</p>
          </note> This reading has been confirmed by a fragmentary cup foot in the Getty museum with
          the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">...[*A*m*a]*s*i*d*o*s
            &epig-rough;*u*u*s</foreign>.<note anchored="true" n="6">

          </note> The potter Kleophrades was therefore the son of the mid-sixth century potter
          Amasis, who has lent his name to the Amasis Painter. Like Amasis, whose vases were
          decorated by both the Amasis Painter and the Taleides Painter, Kleophrades not only made
          cups for the Kleophrades Painter but also signed two cups by Douris, including one in
          Malibu which includes the patronymic: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*l*e*o*f*r*a*d*e*s
            *e*p*o*i*e*s*e*n *A*m*a*s*i*d*o*s</foreign>.<note anchored="true" n="7">

                <bibl>von Bothmer 1985, 230-31</bibl>; and <bibl>D. Buitron-Oliver, "A Cup for a
                Hero," <title>Greek Vases in the J. Paul Getty Museum</title> 5 (1991) 65-74</bibl>.
              His signature on the foot of <rs key="Perseus:object:Berlin F 2283" type="vase">Berlin
                F 2283</rs> or <rs key="Perseus:object:Berlin F 2284" type="vase">Berlin F 2284</rs>
              (it is not clear to which cup the foot belongs) lacks the patronymic (<bibl>ARV2, 429,
                21-22</bibl>). Bothmer suggests that the fragmentary foot in the Getty signed by
              Kleophrades, mentioned above (<rs key="Perseus:object:Malibu 80.AE.54" type="vase"
                >Malibu 80.AE.54</rs>), may belong to one of the Berlin cups. For the question of
              the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)poi/hsen</foreign> — potter or
              workshop owner? — see <bibl>M. Robertson, "The Pioneers in Context," in
                  <title>Euphronios und seine Zeit</title> (Berlin 1992) 132-39</bibl>.</p>

        <p>After Beazley had given the name Kleophrades Painter to the anonymous artist, he
          attributed to him the pelike <rs key="Perseus:object:Berlin F 2170" type="vase">Berlin F
            2170</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 185, 28</bibl>), a late work but indisputably from the painter's
          hand (<figure n="1992.07.0200" rend="float"/>). On either side is a figure of a goddess
          and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*I*K*T*E*T*O*S *E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>
          ("Epiktetos painted it") (<figure n="1992.07.0210" rend="float"/>; <figure
            n="1992.07.0211" rend="float"/>; <figure n="1992.07.0212" rend="float"/>). Because this
          was also the name of another vase-painter, an older contemporary of the Kleophrades
          Painter who specialized in cups, the name Kleophrades Painter was retained in the
          literature, but usually with "Epiktetos II" following it in parentheses (e.g. <bibl>ARV2,
            181</bibl>). The signatures on the Berlin pelike, however, were shown by Boardman to be
          modern, and we are once again in the dark as to the artist's real name.<note
            anchored="true" n="8">
            <p>For the signatures on the Berlin pelike, see <bibl>Richter 1936, 112-115</bibl>; and

        <p>Beazley ultimately attributed 113 red-figures vases to the Kleophrades Painter, and also
          21 black-figure works, including several Panathenaic prize amphorae. One of the red-figure
          fragments has been found to join a stamnos by the Triptolemos Painter,<note anchored="true"

          </note> but additional attributions have brought the red-figure total to about 135 (even
          more, if one accepts some of the more controversial attributions mentioned below). Several
          of the new works are fragments from the Kerameikos, including the painter's only
          column-krater and parts of two loutrophoroi and two calyx-kraters, as well as additional

        <p>The earliest years of the Kleophrades Painter's career have been the object of recent
          study, but there is disagreement as to which works should be included in his oeuvre; for
          example, Robert Guy believes the vases of Beazley's Pezzino Group are by the young
          Kleophrades Painter, but Robertson disagrees.<note anchored="true" n="19">

              collection (<bibl>ARV2, 1621, 3 bis</bibl>). Guy also adds to the Group the
              neck-amphora <rs key="Perseus:object:Vienna 3723" type="vase">Vienna 3723</rs>

              in his earliest period and thought the Harvard kalpis recalled Euthymides and the
              earliest Kleophrades Painter. Richter (<bibl>Richter 1936, 109-112</bibl>) attributed
              the Vienna amphora to the Kleophrades Painter himself (as does Guy). For the Pezzino

        <head>Phases of the Kleophrades Painter's Career</head>

        <p>Beazley divided the painter's red-figure works into four main categories: very early,
          early, later, and late. In addition, three vases are described as "earlyish" and one as
          "latish." No middle period is defined, but there are twice as many "later" works as there
          are in any other category, and one can easily see the differences between the "early"
          calyx-krater <rs key="Perseus:object:Harvard 1960.236" type="vase">Harvard 1960.236</rs>,
          the "later" neck-amphora <rs key="Perseus:object:Harrow 55" type="vase">Harrow 55</rs>,
          and the "late" pelike <rs key="Perseus:object:Berlin F 2170" type="vase">Berlin F
          2170</rs>. In general, the amphorae of type A with framed pictures, the pointed amphorae,
          the psykters and volute-kraters, the hydria of black-figure shape, a third to half of the
          calyx-kraters, at least two of the kylikes, some of the stamnoi, and perhaps two of the
          kalpides with framed pictures on the shoulder may be confidently assigned to the first
          half of his career. Those from the second half include the neck-amphorae and pelikai, the
          loutrophoroi and the amphorae of Panathenaic shape, a skyphos, the kalpides with unframed
          pictures and most of those with framed pictures, and a portion of the cups, stamnoi, and
          calyx-kraters. A <foreign xml:lang="la">terminus ante quem</foreign> of sorts is provided for
          the fragments from the Kerameikos, some of which are inscribed with the name of Megakles,
          the son of Hippokrates, who faced ostracism in 487/6 B.C. Two of these are from a
          calyx-krater with black palmettes on the rim,<note anchored="true" n="20">
            <p><bibl>Knigge 1970, pl. 1</bibl>.</p>
          </note> identical to those on the "early" krater <rs
            key="Perseus:object:Tarquinia RC 4196" type="vase">Tarquinia RC 4196</rs> and on some of
          the "very early" amphorae of type A. However, the Kerameikos fragments also include part
          of a pelike, a shape otherwise assigned to the painter's "later" or "late" period, and a
          calyx-krater described by Beazley as "later."<note anchored="true" n="21">

          </note> It seems, therefore, that the Kerameikos fragments, which should date around 490
          B.C., may be a point of departure in defining a middle period for the Kleophrades Painter,
          characterized by the presence of both earlier and later elements.</p>

        <p>Although there is debate about the exact nature of the painter's style at the very
          beginning of his career, his hand soon becomes distinctive, remaining so over the years
          despite various changes in his drawing habits. As already mentioned, his figures tend to
          be large, big-boned, and full-blooded, but never lumpen or crude. One of his most
          distinctive habits is the occasional outlining of the lips with relief lines, often just
          the lower lip, but sometimes both (<figure n="1990.01.1353" rend="float"/>). Early figures
          have deeply hooked clavicles (<figure n="1990.01.1346" rend="float"/>; <figure

        <p>The Kleophrades Painter did paint a few smaller vases, and his few cups are among his
          finest works, but he was primarily a painter of larger pots such as kraters, amphorae,
          hydriai, and pelikai. His range is wide, with all of the major krater types represented
          and most of the amphorae. Most numerous are the calyx-kraters, over twenty of them, which
          may be painted with figures in continuous procession around the vase, isolated on two
          sides by the floral ornament over the handles, or with only two figures on either side and
          large black areas above the handles.<note anchored="true" n="37">

        <head>Harvard 1960.236: The Return of Hephaistos</head>

        <p>The subject is the Return of Hephaistos to Olympus. Because of his lameness, the god of
          fire was not respected by his parents Zeus and Hera, who flung him out of Olympus so that
          he fell to earth (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.590">Hom. Il. 1.590-94</bibl>; <bibl
            n="Hom. Il. 18.395">Hom. Il. 18.395-97</bibl>). To trick them into recalling him,
          the crafty god sent Hera a throne; she sat on it and was unable to rise, and only
          Hephaistos knew how to release her. Ares was sent to bring him back, but Hephaistos drove
          him off with hot coals. Dionysos succeeded with a gentler method, getting him drunk on
          wine, putting him on a donkey, and bringing him back amid a raucous procession of satyrs.
          A comic version of the story was included in the <title>Komastai</title> of Epicharmos, a
          Sicilian contemporary of the Kleophrades Painter,<note anchored="true" n="49">

        <p>A continuous procession circles the vase to the right, as on the painter's later version
          of the subject (see below), but the central placement of Dionysos and Hephaistos on
          opposite sides divides the frieze into two halves. On the side with Dionysos, the satyr at
          the far right is, like all the satyrs on the vase, nude and ithyphallic, but unlike the
          others, who have thick hair and long flowing tresses, he is bald on top and has shorter
          hair (<figure n="1990.01.1339" rend="float"/>). These traits and the position he occupies
          may be intentional hints that this satyr is at the head of the procession. The satyr's
          lower body is in profile to the right, but he twists around to tickle the testicles of the
          satyr behind him (<figure n="1990.01.1342" rend="float"/>).<note anchored="true" n="51">

          </note> There is a red wreath in his hair, and with his left arm he clutches a large and
          apparently full wineskin, which like all the animal skins on the vase (except the
          flute-case) is tinted brown with dilute glaze. The tickled satyr throws his head back as
          he plays the double-pipes (<foreign xml:lang="xgreek">auloi</foreign>); a leopard skin covers
          his shoulders (<figure n="1990.01.1327" rend="float"/>). Behind him, at left, Dionysos is
          striding to the right while looking back to the left, a grapevine with leaves of added red
          in his left hand, a black-bodied kantharos in his right. He wears a leopard-skin over his
          short chiton and has a himation slung over both shoulders; the brown, spotted skin makes a
          handsome contrast with the stylized folds of the cloak (<figure n="1990.01.1317"
            rend="float"/>). There are laced shoes on his feet (tinted brown with dilute glaze) and
          a wreath of ivy with reserved leaves on his head. In physique, he is every bit as stocky
          and thick-limbed as the satyrs, a powerful figure in which the influence of Euthymides is
          at its most evident. The satyr to the left of Dionysos is playing a barbiton, striking the
          strings with a plektron attached to the lyre by a red cord (<figure n="1990.01.1403"
            rend="float"/>). His head is thrown back and his mouth opened in song (<figure
            n="1990.01.1405" rend="float"/>). Like the piper, he wears a red wreath and a spotted
          leopard-skin; in this case, the head of the cat can be seen hanging at his shoulder. Next
          in line is a satyr carrying a large volute-krater, the handles of which overlap the rim
          above (<figure n="1990.01.1400" rend="float"/>).<note anchored="true" n="52">

        <milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>

        <p>The scene on the other side begins with the next satyr in line. He has his hands full,
          for he is holding the red lead strap of Hephaistos' donkey and at the same time is
          carrying a large pointed amphora on his shoulder (<figure n="1990.01.1379" rend="float"/>
          and <figure n="1990.01.1382" rend="float"/>). He twists around to look backwards, his lips
          parted in what may be a salty oath directed at the donkey. A flute-case (<foreign
            xml:lang="xgreek">sybene</foreign>) hangs from his left arm (<figure n="1990.01.1385"
            rend="float"/>). Hephaistos rides serenely along, simply clothed in a himation and red
          wreath. The top of the god's head overlaps the rim, and his face has been drawn directly
          on the beveled slope below (<figure n="1990.01.1372" rend="float"/>). The tool resting on
          his shoulder may be a double-headed hammer, a particular attribute of his, but it is so
          sharply indented in the center and so clearly different from the hammers carried by the
          satyr that it may instead be the axe with which he struck the head of Zeus to release the
          newborn Athena (<figure n="1990.01.1373" rend="float"/>).<note anchored="true" n="54">

          head bowed in concentration (<figure n="1990.01.1363" rend="float"/>). Accompanying him is
          another satyr, at left, who not only plays the double-pipes but also carries an enormous
          goat-skin bellows over his left shoulder, its wooden nozzle hanging down like a spent
          phallus (<figure n="1990.01.1355" rend="float"/>). The furry texture of the bellows is

          which stood within kraters filled with cold well water or mountain snow. All three
          examples are among his earliest works and all are of the unlidded variety, with no lugs or

          by the feet of Herakles and Dionysos. The latter stand amidst a row of satyrs, who kneel

          figures in a variety of postures (<figure n="1992.09.0020" rend="float"/>), but the
          Kleophrades Painter is generally less fond of such experiments than his teachers. The
          komasts on the reverse of another type A amphora, in the Vatican (<bibl>ARV2, 182,
          3</bibl>), have something of the ponderous grace of Euthymides, while the various postures
          adopted by Theseus and his opponents on the kylix <rs

          their contortions. On the obverse of the Würzburg amphora (<figure
            n="1992.09.0009" rend="float"/>), a departing warrior reads the omens in the liver of a
          sacrificial victim, watched by his wife and child, and by a warrior in exotic oriental
          garb (<figure n="1992.09.0011" rend="float"/>). The obverse of the Vatican vase shows not
          a departure, but the arrival of Herakles in Olympus, where he his greeted by his
          patroness, Athena.</p>

        <milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>

        <p>The painter's other amphora of type A, the fragmentary <rs
            key="Perseus:object:Wrzburg L 508" type="vase">Würzburg L 508</rs> (<bibl>ARV2,
            182, 5</bibl>), is later than the others and has a different decorative scheme, with two
          pairs of unframed figures: Phoenix and Ajax, and Hektor and Priam (<figure
            n="1992.09.0048" rend="float"/> and <figure n="1992.09.0059" rend="float"/>). The two
          warriors are being separated at the conclusion of their dual, Ajax carrying the sword he
          received from Hektor (<figure n="1992.09.0062" rend="float"/>) and Hektor holding the belt
          given by Ajax (<figure n="1992.09.0058" rend="float"/>). The source is <bibl
            n="Hom. Il. 7.273-312">Hom. Il. 7.273-312</bibl>, but the painter substitutes Phoenix
          and Priam for the heralds Talthybios and Idaios. The tension between the two antagonists
          is almost palpable, despite their being on opposite sides of the vase. As Beth Cohen has
          noted, such unity of decoration on an individual, two-sided vase was not the rule in Attic
          vase-painting of the period and is one of the innovations which sets the Kleophrades
          Painter apart from his contemporaries; examples can be found throughout his oeuvre,
          particularly on the neck-amphorae and those of Panathenaic shape, such as <rs

        <p>Some of the finest works of the painter's maturity are his neck-amphorae with twisted

          </note> The Berlin Painter and his imitators, such as the Harrow Painter, also favored
          these large, well-potted vessels. Like the Berlin Painter, the Kleophrades Painter placed
          single, unframed figures on either side, but unlike him he made them part of the same
          spatial and temporal continuum. Thus two satyrs bring up the armor which Dionysos will
          wear in the battle with the Giants, Herakles attacks a rock-wielding centaur, and Apollo
          confronts Herakles as he steals the Delphic tripod.<note anchored="true" n="81">

          killing Priam, who sits on the altar holding his bleeding head, his dead grandson Astyanax
          in his lap. Trojan women and warriors cower and fall on either side. The naked Cassandra
          is pulled from the statue of Athena by the lesser Ajax, who does not notice Aeneas
          escaping with his father Anchises. On the opposite side, the sons of Theseus rescue their
          grandmother Aithra, and a Trojan woman attacks a Greek with a corn-pounder. The
          composition is sweeping and complex, with even the subsidiary ornament — running
          spirals above, slanted palmettes below — contributing to the sense of rolling
          destruction. The air of grief and pathos are a departure for the painter and indeed for
          Attic vase-painting up to this time; in this sense, the Naples hydria is a harbinger of
          the Early Classical style.<note anchored="true" n="98">

        <p>The painter's neck-amphorae do not date from his earliest period and are possibly as late
          as 485-480, which would make them contemporary with his Panathenaic prize amphorae.<note
            anchored="true" n="115">
            <p>For the dating of the Panathenaics, see <bibl>Matheson 1989, 110</bibl>. They thus
              pre-date the prize amphorae of the Berlin Painter, which Beazley assigned to his
              latest period, after 480; <bibl>Beazley 1986, 87</bibl>.</p>
          </note> Attribution of the neck-amphorae is facilitated by comparing the figures to those
          in the chariot and athletic scenes on the reverses of the prize amphorae, for the Athenas
          on the obverse are clearly from his hand. These massive, striding goddesses, with outlined
          lips and skin of added white, have an air of menacing purpose (<figure n="1990.02.0047"
            rend="float"/> and <figure n="1990.05.0519" rend="float"/>). The shields they carry have
          the same device, a flying Pegasos in added white (<figure n="1990.02.0052" rend="float"
          />), which Robertson suggests may have been dictated by in the contract between the state
          and the workshop.<note anchored="true" n="116">

          wears an Attic helmet with a stilted crest and no cheek-flaps. She always wears the

        <head>Provenances of His Works</head>

        <p>The Kleophrades Painter was a great artist, but like all Attic vase-painters, he was
          probably a man of humble status, possibly even a slave, who worked with his hands for a
          living. He and his fellow vase-painters toiled to produce painted pottery not only for
          domestic consumption but also for export to foreign markets, particularly Italy. A
          relatively large percentage of the vases attributed to him, some 82%, have known
          provenances. Of these, over half (54%) were found in Italy: 43% in Etruria and 11% in
          South Italy and Sicily. The rest were found in Greece, the vast majority in Athens or
            Attica.<note anchored="true" n="123">
            <p>My count is 40 from Etruria, 5 each from Sicily and South Italy (including Nola and
              Salerno), 38 from Athens or Attica, two from Corinth, and one each from Delos
              (Rheneia) and Kamiros).</p>
          </note> Of those from Etruria, well over half are from Vulci (63%), including not only
          most of his early works with provenances, but a few late works as well.<note
            anchored="true" n="124">
            <p>Vulci also predominates among the Etruscan provenances of the Berlin Painter, perhaps
              indicating a Vulcian taste for pots over cups rather than a connection between the two
              workshops.</p>
          </note> A few works, both early and late, have been found at Tarquinia and Cerveteri, and
          a few others at Chiusi and Viterbo. The relatively small number of pieces from Greek
          southern Italy and Sicily attests the continued dominance of the Etruscan market during
          most of the painter's career, a balance that shifted in the following decades. The large
          number of pieces from Athens may indicate that our appreciation for the painter's talents
          was shared by his compatriots, who purchased his works for dedication on the Acropolis and
          for inclusion among the goods buried with their kinsmen in the Kerameikos.</p>

        <head>Followers of the Kleophrades Painter</head>

        <p>The Kleophrades Painter was too talented an artist not to be without followers and
          imitators, though his influence was more limited than the Berlin Painter, whose cooler
          style may have been more congenial to young artists of the Early Classical period. Among
          his later red-figure followers is the Troilos Painter, named after the scene on the hydria
            <rs key="Perseus:object:London 1899.7-21.4" type="vase">London 1899.7-21.4</rs>
            (<bibl>ARV2, 297, 15</bibl>; <figure n="1990.14.0065" rend="float"/>). He actively
          imitated the master's style in the late 480s and early 470s, outlining the lips of his
          figures and draping them in "Cleophradean" himatia.<note anchored="true" n="125">
            <p>For the Troilos Painter, see <bibl>Beazley 1912, 171-73</bibl>; <bibl>ARV2, 296-97,
                1643, and 1705</bibl>; <bibl>ABV, 400</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 175 and 356</bibl>;

                <bibl>Padgett 1989, 305-320</bibl>.</p>
          </note> Beazley reported that a stamnos by the Kleophrades Painter (<rs
            key="Perseus:object:Vatican, Astarita 735" type="vase">Vatican, Astarita 735</rs>) was
          found in the same tomb as another by the Troilos Painter (<rs
            key="Perseus:object:Williams 1964.9" type="vase">Williams 1964.9</rs>; <figure
            n="1990.09.0023" rend="float"/>); the vases are of the same model and apparently by the
          same potter, so it seems certain the two artists were working side-by-side.<note
            anchored="true" n="126">
            <p>See <bibl>ARV2, 1632, 58 bis and 1643, 10 bis</bibl>. With these were also found a
              pair of pelikai by the Syleus Painter: <rs
                key="Perseus:object:Vatican, Astarita 731-732" type="vase">Vatican, Astarita
              731-732</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 1639, 17 bis and 17 ter</bibl>). Philippaki assigns most of
              the stamnoi by the Troilos Painter to the workshop of the Kleophrades Painter, which
              also produced the stamnoi decorated by the Hephaisteion Painter and the Dokimasia
              Painter; see <bibl>Philippaki 1967, 52-56</bibl>. Like the Kleophrades Painter, the
              Troilos Painter may also have decorated some black-figure neck-amphorae (<bibl>ABV,
                400</bibl>).</p>
          </note> Despite the obvious influence of the Kleophrades Painter, however, the Troilos
          Painter was a distinctly poorer draughtsman and there can be no real confusion between
          them.</p>

        <p>The Kleophrades Painter's worklife came to an end sometime in the late 470s, but just as
          there is disagreement about the beginning of his career, there is also some question about
          its end. The Boot Painter, a red-figure cup-painter active in the late 470s and early
          460s, was said by Beazley to continue the late style of the Kleophrades Painter; in
          discussing one of his cups in Cyprus (<rs key="Perseus:object:Nicosia V 414" type="vase"
            >Nicosia V 414</rs>; <bibl>ARV2, 821, 1</bibl>) Beazley even wondered "whether cups like
          ours might not be the work of the Kleophrades Painter in his very latest phase."<note
            anchored="true" n="127">
            <p><bibl>J. D. Beazley, <title>Some Attic Vases in the Cyprus Museum</title> (London
                1948) 43</bibl>. For the Boot Painter, see <bibl>ARV2, 821-23</bibl>; <bibl>Para.,

              155</bibl>.</p>
          </note> The Boot Painter's lively figures, with large eyes, and occasionally outlined
          lips, do indeed owe a debt to the Kleophrades Painter, but it seems unlikely that they are
          from his hand. As Robertson so well puts it, "the doubt is a good example of the problems
          that beset us in studying a very ill-documented field in which the practitioners are at
          one and the same time commercial pot-decorators and serious artists, working over a period
          of profound and rapid change in visual perceptions."<note anchored="true" n="128">
