                    <date>800-760 B.C.</date>
                </p>
                <p>Lent by The Detroit Institute of Arts; Founders Society Purchase, Dr.
                    Lester Cameron Bequest Fund (65.82).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. with lid 18.4 cm; H.
                    without lid 11.3 cm; W. 25.0 cm; D. of lid 18.0 cm; D. of mouth 15.8 cm; D. of
                    base 17.2 cm. Body and lid broken and repaired; some minor repair and
                    repainting. Torus body with flat lid (flat pyxis). The shape of the knob on the
                    lid is a somewhat smaller version of the pyxis itself, but on a stand and with a
                    conical lid. The edge of the lid and lip are pierced with four holes; the holes
                    are ancient.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The focus is a central
                    zone of large meander pattern with interior hatching; above this central motif a
                    fine band, first of zigzags, then of chevrons, each separated by three careful
                    lines in dilute; below the meanders two narrow bands, first one of zigzags, then
                    one of rays, again each differentiated by three fine lines in dilute glaze. This
                    same design of thin lines accentuates the mouth and the base, just over a thick
                    band at the base which gives weight and balance to the entire decoration of the
                    vase. The lid at the center has a wide band, a thin zone of zigzags, then one of
                    dots and, near the edge, a band of rays (pointing in); again each motif is
                    separated from the next by well-spaced triple lines (two lines on the edge
                    itself). The knob has banding on the cone, chevrons on the widest part, and
                    bands on the ribbed shaft. The bottom of the vase is reserved, the resting
                    surface, now worn, was glazed; the interior is reserved except for the sunken
                    lip which is glazed. The underside of the lid is reserved and has an "X"
                    graffito near one of the tie holes, at the edge.</p>
                <p>The hatching in the meander-zone and other motives seem to have been
                    made with brushes which had multiple hairs, perhaps in one case with fourteen or
                    fifteen limbs and in another with nine. There are noticeable puddles of glaze at
                    the end of each stroke and, as Prof. Coldstream has said of the period (infra,
                    pp. 23-25), the outlines of the meander pattern are not consistently neat. Knobs
                    in the shape of a vase are a pleasing touch not infrequent in Greek ceramics,
                    some of the most elaborate of which are found in late Hellenistic pottery from
                    Centuripe (Sicily) and on South Italian bombylioi. As basic reference: <bibl

                    Late Geometric in Corinth
                    ca. 750-720 B.C.</p>
                <p>Lent by The Detroit Institute of Arts; Founders Society Purchase,
                    William H. Murphy Fund (76.97).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 22.6 cm; W. 21.0 cm;
                    D. of mouth 5.8 cm. Broken and repaired; large portion of the underside repaired
                    and toned; portions of lower edges repaired and repainted and minor retouching
                    on upper surfaces. Underside of vase reserved, center section depressed, some
                    signs of wear and minor pitting. Fine, pale yellow-buff clay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Closely spaced,
                    fastidiously drawn bands covering the neck and body are interrupted by zones of
                    careful geometric motives: lozenges accentuated with dots, in two places on the
                    neck and one on the body; upright double triangles, the inner portion of which
                    is hatched, in a zone on the body near the base of the neck; around the middle
                    of the neck, a frieze of horizontal zigzags with extended points. The outside of
                    the handle is decorated with horizontal bands, the inside glazed. The trefoil
                    mouth is glazed inside and out, the edge in reservation, with a swastika
                    contained in a reserved circle on both sides. The interior of the neck is
                    reserved.</p>
                <p>This vase can broadly be compared to one illustrated and discussed by
                    Prof. Coldstream (<bibl>Coldstream 1968, 98-101 and
                        pl. 19d</bibl>). The finely spaced bands, a characteristic feature of
                    Corinthian vase decoration in the Geometric period, adds lightness and variety
                    to an otherwise rather heavy shape; for the lekythos-oinochoe these schemes are
                    already set in the previous period (p. 96). The swastika is a common motif on
                    Greek Geometric pottery (see <rs type="vase">Madison 68.19.1</rs>
                    and <rs type="vase">Columbia 71.113</rs>). The motif in Greece
                    seems to be an invention of its own artists, a variant of the meander with two
                    elements of the pattern arranged around a central point. For this design it is
                    tempting to see influence from Central Europe, during the Iron Age, where the
                    swastika had some religious associations. However, the very nature of the
                    geometric style in Greece is to build a rather elaborate vocabulary of motives
                    from a few simple basic forms. This process of generation perhaps explains the
                    appearance of the swastika in China and in Meso-America, at Pashash.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Three metopes around
                    neck: bird (r.), doe (l.), and bird (l.). The bodies of the animals are lined
                    and the filling ornament is basically the same in each frame: dotted rosettes
                    and circles with "x"-centers surrounded by dots, sometimes with tails or stems
                    of dots. Three glazed bands on the interior of the vase near the top; lines in
                    triplicate abound on the vase to define and separate each metope from a vertical
                    band of zigzag, which in turn is bordered by vertical glazed lines. This
                    "triglyph and metope" frieze is enhanced above by two pairs of lines and a row
                    of dots and below by four lines, a row of dots, and three more lines. On the
                    belly, a row of connected or running dots and five evenly spaced, well-drawn
                    lines; then a zone in black glaze at the bottom. There are three lines on the
                    handle-strut and two "x"-filled metopes on the handle-face, having nine lines
                    above the first metope, three lines between the two metopes and nine lines
                    between the second and the bottom of the handle. Two mugs at The Metropolitan

                    D. of mouth 33.8 cm; D. of base 27.5 cm. Assembled from numerous fragments, with
                    many areas restored in plaster, especially on base, lower body on B, and neck on
                    A. Contour lines of figures in both panels are modern. Glaze misfired to rust
                    red on all of B. Yellow-brown clay with red-brown slip and overcoating. High
                    neck on ovoid body and conical foot; double handles. Wheel-made in sections,
                    body in two parts joined just beneath handles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Wide zone of thick,
                    vertical, wavy lines on foot, lower body and upper neck; above and below such
                    zones are varying numbers of well-spaced finely-drawn lines in glaze. Broad
                    areas in slip mark the join of the neck to body and body to foot; side of rim
                    and lower edge of foot are black; inside of neck glazed (to a depth of 6 cm),
                    otherwise the interior is reserved; two rows of wild, wavy lines under the
                    handles (side A/B also has random dots); handles are completely painted in slip;
                    stripes, lengthening toward the bottom, accentuate handles' join to the vase. On
                    the lower neck and upper part of the body there is a band of large dots
                    connected tangentially, with smaller dots staggered above and below. The picture
                    area between the handles on either side of the vase is framed by a vertical row
                    of double contoured lozenges, the inner element of which is latticed; this
                    scheme is bordered by dotted circles and framed by vertical lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Panels:</hi> the scene is the same on
                    both sides of the vase. A warrior, wearing a helmet which is decorated with
                    latticing, sword and sheath at his waist, stands between two horses facing him.
                    Under each of these large horses is a small horse (facing right). The one on the
                    right, in each scene, seems to be nursing. Above the large horses are two goats,
                    both with heads turned back, to the left (if the details on B can be applied to
                    A). As is typical in early Boeotian painting, the horses have extended muzzles,
                    strikingly thin legs in contrast to their heavy hoofs, and thick, tasselled
                    tails. There is much filling ornament: swastikas, herringbone, small stars,
                    lozenges (many of these latticed), small dots and circles. <hi rend="ital"

                    the average height for Boeotian amphorae is between 45-55 cm. This vase and
                    another (<rs type="vase">Amsterdam 3283</rs>, <bibl
                       >Ruckert, <title>infra,</title> BA 38</bibl>)
                    are nearly twice this size at 91 cm. Such monumentality, the motif itself of the
                    warrior between horses, and other features of the vase-design, seem Attic in
                    inspiration. Scenes of a warrior and animals are more common on small Boeotian
                    vases, e.g., oinochoe Athens 236 (Canciani, <hi rend="ital"
                    >infra,</hi> pl. 67, fig. 19) but are rare on large pieces (Ruckert, <hi
                        rend="ital">infra,</hi> BA 38 and 39). The panel probably
                    depicts a member of the warrior-aristocracy, standing as lord over some of those
                    beasts from which he derived his food, clothing, sport and (possibly) defense.
                    That the nobleman is armed indicates that these resources were coveted, raided,
                    and had to be defended.</p>
                <p>The pictures on this vase can best be understood in light of a
                    passage from the <hi rend="ital">Iliad</hi> (<bibl
                        n="Hom. Il. 11.676">Hom. Il.
                    11.676-684</bibl>) in which the aged Nestor reminisces: </p>
                <l>"exceedingly abundant was the booty we drove out of the
                    plain together, fifty herds of cattle, as many droves of swine, as many herds of
                    goats, and a hundred and fifty bays, all mares, and many with foals following
                    underneath."</l>
                <p>That Homer may have described his own time as well as Nestor's, and
                    that between the late Bronze Age and the Homeric there was a basic similarity in
                    the ordering of society and the management of its resources is entirely
                    believable. Ethnologist Karl Meuli (<bibl>Kahane,
                            <title>infra,</title> p. 184</bibl>) found striking
                    similarities in social make-up between post-Dorian Greeks, i.e. those of Homer's
                    time, on the one hand, and pastoral tribes and cattle-breeding nomads from the
                    southern Steppes, whose traditions go back to the Bronze Age, on the other.</p>
                <p>In the religious realm, both groups share the importance accorded the
                    cult of the dead and given to ancestors; each has funerary ceremonies with
                    races, horse races, wrestling, etc., which resemble those given by Achilles for
                    Patroklos (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.259 ff">Hom. Il.
                        23.259 ff</bibl>); the heroes, ancestors and victors in these games were
                    praised in hymn and song, with such festivals often repeated yearly with pomp
                    and for numerous guests. Society for each is arranged in eponymous clans. The
                    Greeks of Homer's time, mid-eighth century B.C., seem not very different from
                    those of whom Nestor spoke in Book XI; furthermore, scenes like those on the
                    Elvehjem vase may be witness to that "agonistic" milieu out of which the
                    Olympian games once emerged. Peter Kahane in a recent article <hi rend="ital"
                       >(infra,</hi> p. 186) connects the painter of this Boeotian vase
                    stylistically to the "Painter of the Cesnola Krater from Kourion" and, in
                    addition to the more apparent Attic and mainland influences, he posits a
                    Euboean-Naxian influence in the "profusion of animals and the atmosphere of the
                    outdoors." From the evidence of newly excavated material from Thebes and
                    neighboring Paralimui, Anne Ruckert concurs, in an exhaustive study of shapes,
                    fabric, and schemes of subsidiary declaration, that Cycladic as well as mainland
                    influences contributed heavily to the art of early Boeotia. More generally:

                <p>Prof. Amyx and, independently, the author, made the attribution to
                    the Painter of Vatican 73. The variety of animals, certain groupings of them,
                    their energetic poses and the schemes for rendering their anatomy are typical of
                    the painter's hand. On his olpai, as a focus for the top and third bands, the
                    painter prefers an arrangement of Sphinxes and a swan. Characteristic too, the
                    cats' ears resemble a notched ivy-leaf and the configuration for their brow is
                    heart-shaped. There are other olpai by this hand in the Midwest: University of
                    Missouri-Columbia (<rs type="vase">Columbia 60.13</rs>), The Toledo
                    Museum of Art (<rs type="vase">Toledo 1963.22</rs>), and Indiana
                    University Art Museum (<rs type="vase">Bloomington 75.22.2</rs>).
                    On this olpe, as Prof. Amyx tells us, the pupils of the panthers' eyes are
                    incised, an uncommon feature with this painter. Two other pieces (<bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, A25 and A26</bibl>), notably a
                    fragment from Megara Hyblaea, show the same feature. Also, the panthers' heads
                    are of a broader, heavier design. The incised pupils and thicker proportions
                    remind one of the Sphinx Painter who, as Professor Amyx believes, was an
                    associate of the Painter of Vatican 73, perhaps during the latter's later
                    period. There is a certain angularity and compression of the schemes and less
                    care to the alignment of the central motives in each band, front and back. The
                    shoulder enclosure for the cats here is apt to be a closed shape, and in this
                    regard and others, one can compare the painter's olpe in Gotha (<bibl
                       >CVA, Germany 24, Gotha I, pls. 6-8</bibl>).
                    Recurring characteristics of his hand are the greaves or chaps which follow the
                    contour of the front of the belly-stripe. Still very much in the elegant
                    tradition of the Protocorinthian, the painter pays attention to specific detail,
                    whether the braiding of the bull's tail or the knobbing on horns or antlers. The
                    Painter of Vatican 73 is one of the foremost decorators of his time and takes
                    his name from an olpe in the Vatican (<rs type="vase">Albizatti
                    73</rs>). In his earliest style he is close to the painter of an olpe (<rs
                        type="vase">Boston 375</rs>), and the Sphinx Painter and
                    Painter of Berlin 1136 are contemporaries and probably associates, or students.</p>

                <p>This vase belongs to a group which has been discussed by <bibl
                       >J.G. Szil√°gyi (<title
                            >Vazafest√©szet, infra</title></bibl>). As this important book is
                    in Hungarian and difficult to locate we paraphrase his discussion. The scale
                    design had its origin in local ware, bucchero (<hi rend="ital"
                        >ibid.,</hi> p. 87), but its extensive use in this group of
                    Etrusco-Corinthian painting was largely because of the popularity of the motif
                    in Corinthian pottery, especially on pointed aryballoi. Because scholars thought
                    the scales on Etrusco-Corinthian vases to be of Middle Corinthian influence,
                    they tended to date vases such as this one from the Nelson Gallery, to the sixth
                    century. In fact the Corinthian scales of this period are different insofar as
                    they end in two incised strokes and almost invariably are facing down. In
                    Corinth, scales occur on a few vases as early as Early Protocorinthian (<bibl
                       >Johansen, <title>Les Vases
                            Sicyonien</title> [Paris 1923] pls. 22,I and 23,2E</bibl>). The motif is
                    ultimately an ancient eastern one, and Payne(<bibl
                        >Payne 1931, p. 19, n. 2</bibl>) mentions the affinities of the alternating
                    coloration with Assyrian painted bricks. Scales are found in Greece in the
                    Mycenaean period, and scales appear in Cretan geometric ware (<bibl
                       >Boyd, AJA 5 [1901] 146, fig. 9</bibl>) from which the motif
                    could easily have become Corinthian.</p>
                <p>This amphora is a product of the seventh century B.C. The hands of a
                    few masters have been ascertained among the III pieces of the Scale-amphora
                    Group, but Szil√°gyi's work on this group, as he himself admits, is still
                    provisional. Some sixty-six vases have known provenience, all from Caere save
                    one (<bibl>Montelius, <title>La
                            Civilisation Primitive en Italie</title> [Stockholm 1895-1910] plate
                        274, n. 4</bibl>). It is likely, because of their size, that the group was
                    actually made there, "the total product of a single workshop" <bibl
                       ><title>(Vazafest√©szet, infra,</title>
                        p. 83</bibl>). Szil√°gyi argues that toward the end of the seventh
                    century the Etruscan oil industry became independent of the Greek, and that
                    these amphorae, with their very thick walls and strong handles, may have been
                    made to hold such a heavy liquid, or possibly grain <hi rend="ital"
                        >(ibid.,</hi> pp. 82-83). Besides these elaborately decorated vases there
                    are many undecorated examples made in this workshop which still need to be
                    collected and studied. Professor Szil√°gyi argues that it is this group of
                    undecorated vases which was made in imitation of the Attic "SOS" amphorae, not
                    the Scale-amphora Group, which is "rather a local shape transformed by Greek
                    characteristics" (<hi rend="ital">ibid.</hi>, p. 81). He mentions
                    that locally made amphorae and canteen-shaped vases (a shape which was made
                    later in the group's production) have been found with subgeometric decoration,
                    but he says that the earliest Etruscan developments of the group have yet to be
                    discovered (<hi rend="ital">ibid.,</hi> p. 87). The neck-amphora
                    was not a shape native to Italy. The pithos, with its lower center of gravity
                    and similar but less sharply pointed pyriform base, does exist in Villanovan
                    pottery. Late Protocorinthian and Transitional Corinthian aryballoi, though very
                    much smaller, are similar in design.</p>
                <p>Szil√°gyi was not able, at the time of his writing, to assign a
                    place to the Kansas City amphora within the context of his "miniaturist" style
                    ‚Äî the first of three phases of decoration which he identified in the
                    group's production. The figure-style here is stiff and ill-defined and suggests
                    a period past the phase's prime, c. 610 B.C. for this vase. However, the shape
                    ‚Äî with a wide belly curving marvelously to an extremely narrow base
                    ‚Äî is characteristic of the earliest pots of his miniaturist style, that
                    is c. 620 B.C. The dotted rosettes also argue for the earlier date.</p>
                <p>The closest vase in form and style is an amphora in Toronto, <rs
                        type="vase">Royal Ontario Museum 969.224.1</rs>. Slightly
                    smaller in size, the Toronto vase is identical in form and figure style. The
                    Toronto vase has dual friezes and the centaurs are naked, in good Corinthian
                    fashion, not clothed as here.</p>
                <p>The style of the vase at the Nelson Gallery as well as that at
                    Toronto is similar to the earliest work (Ricci, <hi rend="ital"
                        >MonAnt</hi> 42 [1955] 525) of the Le Havre Painter-named after vase 16 in
                    the Nouveau Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts ‚Äî whose work spans the entire
                    period of the miniaturist style. A certain roundness of the jaw of his animals,
                    an unforgettable muzzle or beak, spindly legs, oddly drawn wings, incised
                    contours of the figures and their tendency to march routinely in the same
                    direction, all characterize the earliest work of the Le Havre Painter. The only
                    element not in accord with Szil√°gyi's characterization of this master's
                    work is his lack of filling ornament. Whether created by this hand or that of a
                    student, the Toronto and Kansas City amphorae were contemporary with the Le
                    Havre Painter's work and in proximity to it. The miniaturist style ends with the
                    final vases of this artist. After this, the Scale-amphora workshop's production
                    is dominated by the work of the Bearded Sphinx Painter and the "elongated" style
                    which he introduced (<bibl><title

                    ca. 620-610 B.C.</p>
                <p>Lent by the Indiana University Art Museum (73.59.2).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 46.0 cm; D. of body
                    29.5 cm; D. at lip 13.0 cm; liquid contents c. 14.5 liters. The clay is of a
                    rather porous structure, close to tile fabric, medium-hard to soft. Its color is
                    7.5 YR 7.5/3 pinkish-gray-white to pink (Munsell). Added red and off-white have
                    been widely used. The neck-amphora stands on a high, conical foot with steep
                    sides, its underside is a straight ring, the bottom slightly hanging. The rather
                    pointed, broad, egg-shaped body leads over a wide, evenly rounded shoulder into
                    the solid, slightly conical neck. The rim opens outwards in a strong
                    echinus-curve, its interior is hollowed as if to fit a lid. The handles rise
                    from below the middle of the shoulder and connect with the neck at its middle,
                    forming a wide, sharp arc. They are flattish oval in section. The vessel has
                    been deformed, apparently before the firing in the kiln: the rim is sagging
                    towards Side B, and further below, the whole side of the body has warped and
                    caved inwards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The base of decoration
                    consists of somewhat unevenly applied brown glaze which has worn off in certain
                    areas. With the exception of a narrow reserved band below the cable pattern in
                    the center, the band of the frieze itself, and the underside of the handles, the
                    exterior of the amphora is fully painted. The main decorative pattern consists
                    of a continuous scale pattern which covers most of the body. These scales, each
                    of a fair size, are compass-drawn. The insertion marks are very distinct,
                    forming, in themselves, a subsidiary pattern. Emphasizing the body structure of
                    the vase, the scales of the lower half are directed upwards against the frieze.
                    Those of the upper section point downwards. The even, carpet-like cover of the
                    scales is gently interrupted only twice by a tongue-pattern: once at the
                    beginning of the body above the foot, where it is rising, and again at the
                    neck-shoulder join where it is directed down. Like the scales, these tongues are
                    painted alternately red and off-white. The color decoration of the scales
                    consists of large dots alternately red and off-white. These dots are arranged in
                    an oblique, spiralling fashion, creating long arcs across the body, as the
                    colors create long sequences emphasizing the centers of the scales.</p>
                <p>The largest abstract design, a simple cable (guilloche) pattern below
                    the main frieze, has been woven from inter-twining red and off-white bands.
                    While not always fully symmetrical in its construction, this cable pattern has
                    also, like the scales, been created with the help of the compass. Three circle
                    segments, centered closely on the same line ‚Äî roughly in the center of
                    each "cable eye" ‚Äî combine to bring about the sinewy, forward-moving
                    pattern.</p>
                <p>The frieze is a broad reserved band with a cover of creamy slip; on
                    Side A, in the center to the left, there is a kneeling centaur with human
                    forelegs. Over his shoulder he carries a tree formed from tendrils which he
                    grasps with his left hand. His right hand is raised in a gesture of apparent
                    excitement. His medium-long hair is coarsely incised and was originally
                    encircled by a fillet in added red. His face shows a solid, strong profile, his
                    chin juts forward, the frontally rendered eye is slanting outwards. His kneeling
                    front legs have strong haunches, supported by rather delicate calves, resting on
                    elongated, slender feet. The horse's body is attenuated; the legs appear
                    somewhat short. His genitals are clearly marked; the tail falls down in a
                    triangle, touching the ground. He is positioned in front of a group of three
                    animals ‚Äî two deer and a panther. The latter attacks the central deer
                    from behind, biting it in the hindquarters. This deer, in turn, hangs its
                    foreleg over the back of the one in front of it. The remaining figures of the
                    animal frieze are less active. They stalk in rhythmic gait without engaging in
                    much noticeable activity. In front of the centaur parades a panther, following a
                    griffin. Continuing clockwise around the vessel proceed a Siren, a lion, another
                    panther (whose hindquarters are now partially missing), a goat, a ram, another
                    panther, another lion and a Sphinx which comes up to the tail-end of the panther
                    of the central group behind the centaur.</p>
                <p>Characteristic of all animals are their stretched, rubbery-appearing
                    bodies, rendered in firm, gently undulating lines. They walk on solid, heavy
                    legs in which some of the tendons are incised, while claws and paws are always
                    sharply outlined. Their tails, if present, curve up in swan-neck curves and end
                    in tassels which often resemble the stylized heads of waterfowl. Particular
                    sections of the body, the neck and the wings are set-off in added red. Eyes
                    appear in diluted brown, a rendering which gives them a more staring appearance.</p>
                <p>In comparison to Corinthian vases the vessel's shape appears less
                    elegantly designed and thought through, while on the other hand, it displays a
                    more robust air and a higher degree of simple functionality. The drawing of the
                    figures, likewise, lacks the graciousness and refinement customary in Greek
                    vases. A hallmark, however, is the rustic quality of the animals, especially the
                    centaur.</p>
                <p>The Etrusco-Corinthian problem has been discussed by <bibl

                        type="vase">Kansas City 47-43</rs>). Among the vessels
                    mentioned there, this amphora stands very close to two similar ones in the Villa
                    Giulia (<bibl>P. Mingazzini, <title

                    the other one with a decoration of scale and cable. For an amphora with three

                <p>This is another vase from the "Scale-amphora Group" which is not far
                    in its particulars from the amphora in the Nelson Gallery. The group is not
                    discussed in its entirety, except in Hungarian, by J. G. Szil√°gyi, in
                        <bibl><title>Etruszko -
                            Korinthosi Vazafest√©szet</title> (Budapest 1975)</bibl>, so we
                    give a discussion of the development of the group here.</p>
                <p>Szil√°gyi defines three phases of decoration in the
                    Scale-amphora Group. The Bloomington amphora belongs to his first style, termed
                    "miniature," where the frieze seems secondary to shape and geometric designs
                    which cover the vase. The work of one artist spans the entire period of the
                    miniature style, from its beginnings (<bibl>Ricci,
                            <title>MonAnt</title> 42 [1955] 525-526, no. 1, fig.
                    127</bibl>) through its height (<bibl><title
                           >Hesperia Art Bulletin</title> 47 [1969] A. 22</bibl>) to
                    a "degenerate" phase (<bibl>CVA, Belgium 3, Brussels
                        3, IV B, pl. 1, 1a-b</bibl>). Called the Le Havre Painter after his name
                    vase (<bibl>16 Nouveau Mus√©e des
                    Beaux-Arts</bibl>), his earliest piece, according to Szil√°gyi <hi
                        rend="ital">(supra,</hi> p. 70), is indistinguishable from the
                    work of the Cambridge group, which centers on the vase at the Museum of
                    Classical Archaeology (<rs type="vase">Cambridge CE 2</rs>). Some
                    pieces of this later group, Szil√°gyi feels, will be found to be the work
                    of the Le Havre Painter, since neither the Cambridge group nor the Le Havre
                    Painter used filling ornaments. The figures on this earliest vase of the Le
                    Havre Painter bear a similarity to those on the Nelson Gallery amphora (see <rs
                        type="vase">Kansas City 47-43</rs>). The Le Havre Painter is
                    the prime master of the miniaturist phase.</p>
                <p>The second phase of the "Scale-amphora Group" is a period
                    characterized by an elongation of the figures and a slimming of the amphora
                    shape. The development is especially important in the "Scale-amphora" workshop,
                    because it marks the introduction to the style of a master whose skill was
                    already well practiced at Vulci - the Bearded Sphinx Painter. According to
                    Szil√°gyi <hi rend="ital">(supra,</hi> p. 84-85),"The Bearded
                    Sphinx Painter at mid-point in his production, changed shops to one which
                    provided opportunities for his artistic abilities and one in which he was
                    satisfied with pupils who follow his example." Because the Bearded Sphinx
                    Painter had not worked with the masters of the miniature style, his art is not a
                    development from the first phase of the group.</p>
                <p>It is a student of the Bearded Sphinx Painter who breaks with
                    tradition, and decorates many different shapes, amphorae being in a minority.
                    Named the Canteen Painter, after an unusual shape (<rs type="vase"
                        >Berlin Inv. 31270</rs>), he is related to the Bearded Sphinx Painter,
                    possibly as his student. Szil√°gyi suggests that perhaps the two are
                    identical, but while there are many similarities in style, none of the known
                    pieces of each allows verification of this identity <hi rend="ital"
                        >(supra,</hi> p. 84).</p>
                <p>The last phase of the group, according to Szil√°gyi <hi
                        rend="ital">(supra,</hi> p. 77-78), is a definite development
                    and even a continuation of the elongated style. The figures now are clumsier and
                    coarser -they are done with a "heavy hand." Individual masters are the most
                    difficult to identify in this "heavy" style, because of the poor and inaccurate
                    drawings, but Szil√°gyi is confident that artists will some day be
                    defined, "even with the low quality of painting."</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 8.3 cm; d. of foot 1.3
                    cm; w. of body 4.9 cm; d. at rim 3.6 cm; liquid contents 45.0 cc. Complete, a
                    small chip on the side of the base and a piece of the rim have been repaired in
                    plaster. Fine, dense Corinthian clay, sandy structure, very few pores and some
                    inclusions, medium hard. 2.5Y 7.5/4 pale yellow in color (Munsell color chart).
                    The glaze is black to brown, added red has been amply used.</p>
                <p>The vessel stands on a flat base, hollowed underneath. The stretched
                    ovoid body is topped by a narrow neck, widening gently towards the broad, flat
                    disk-rim. A short handle, rectangular in section, connects the side of the
                    shoulder with the edge of the rim.</p>
                <p>A narrow circle runs around the underside of the base. Around the
                    lower body stand twenty-two slender, round-topped petals, which correspond to
                    twenty similar ones decorating the shoulder, hanging down from the neck. This
                    motif occurs a third time on the lip with thirty lancette-like petals radiating
                    from the pouring hole. They are accompanied by a thin circle at the outer rim
                    edge. On the outside of the handle runs a sharp zigzag, its interstices accented
                    with one dot; on the sides is painted a row of rather large dots. The petals on
                    the body, below and on the shoulder, are overlaid with added red, some of it
                    rather worn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Lower frieze:</hi> shows three dogs, in a running
                    position, two to the right, one to the left. In the latter's back a single small
                    rosette, incised and with added red, has been placed. The dogs' bodies are
                    elongated and this elongation is emphasized by precise and vigorous incision,
                    especially in the hindlegs. The heads on strong necks appear somewhat squarish.
                    Their silhouettes, including the nostrils and the ears, have been carefully
                    outlined; the separation between the head and neck, the jaw line, ear, eye, nose
                    and mouth have been incised. Sections of the legs, front and back, as well as
                    the neck of the dog, have been painted red, as have portions of the tails.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Main frieze:</hi> topped by a band of
                    leftward-running z-pattern between a double line, it features eight men running
                    to the right. They move with long, swift strides, their heads are in profile,
                    their torsos turned frontally with arms extending angularly at either side. From
                    the hips down, their sharply bent legs are also in profile. The background is
                    filled with rosettes of different sizes, all quickly and irregularly drawn with
                    the leaves incised in quick, imprecise lines, some with added red. The incision
                    within the figures is more precise and sure. The details within the bodies are
                    few and not all are standard: calf and thigh muscles, knee caps, genitalia,
                    lower edge of sternum, the muscles separating arm and shoulder (drawn across the
                    full width of the biceps to the outside of the arm). Careful setting of lines
                    serves also to separate the intertwined limbs of the various runners. A downward
                    pointing bow-line separates neck and shoulders, indicating the clavicles. From
                    it ascends the hairline, turning into the volute-like ear. A short line connects
                    the ear with the forehead, a broad fillet sits on top of the head. The eyes are
                    large and circular; extending short lines at either side indicate the corners.
                    Nostrils and mouths are sometimes indicated. Added red often covers the whole of
                    the upper torso; it also can cover parts of the belly and especially the thighs.</p>
                <p>The eight men are all of relatively even size except for the one
                    squeezed in under the handle where the artist had to close a gap. An impression
                    of speed and swiftness is created by the interlocking and overlapping of the
                    widely thrown-out limbs, by the frequent projecting of heads above the topline.
                    The bodies possess a solid massiveness and are rendered with a sober,
                    well-established routine. A particular characteristic of the artist's figures
                    are their long, attenuated hands and feet, almost fin-like in their appearance.</p>
                <p>The theme of foot-races does not occur often in Corinthian
                        ceramics.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true">

                <p>The general fullness of the body, as well as the rather low neck,
                    place this pointed aryballos late within the shape-series which covers the whole
                    span of the seventh century. The shape conforms principally with <bibl
                       >Payne, <title>supra</title> p.
                        22, fig. 8A</bibl>, with which it shares the same lower body and shoulder
                    decoration. The type and placing of the rosette suggest a date in the Early
                    Corinthian period. Considering the sureness of the drawing as well as the
                    routine in the alignment of the runners, one finds this to be a competent artist
                    whose roots, however, seem to go back into the Transitional period, possibly the
                    Late Protocorinthian, judging from the frieze of hounds below, an abbreviated
                    version of the rabbit chase, cf. <bibl>Payne 1933,

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 20.3 cm; d. of mouth
                    5.0 cm; d. of base 6.7 cm; w. 10.2 cm. Complete. Chip on rim, some surface
                    abrasion and pitting; paint missing near base, especially in area below cock's
                    left wing. Typical Corinthian alabastron with flat mouth, pinched handle, small
                    neck, bulbous body and flat base. The mouth is decorated with three concentric
                    bands on the top followed by a series of small dots on the rim. Eleven bold rays
                    enliven the shoulder; most of the handle is also painted. Four horizontal bands
                    separate the figure frieze from the neck rays. The ground line is formed by two
                    horizontal lines followed by a wide band at the alabastron's base. Under the
                    base, a series of concentric rings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> A large cock struts to
                    the right. His left wing is dramatically opened in front of his breast while his
                    right wing trails behind his body. The elaborate tail plumage unfurls into a
                    field of numerous large rosettes. The wings and body of the bird are enhanced by
                    a multitude of parallel incisions to indicate feathers. The field is crowded
                    with small dots and incised rosettes. <hi rend="ital">Added
                    red:</hi> the cock's comb and wattle, alternate tail feathers, central area of
                    outstretched left wing; large dots on both wings.</p>
                <p>This alabastron, whose syntax and shape are particularly common in
                    the Middle Corinthian period (cf. <bibl>P. Ure,
                            <title>Aryballoi and Figurines from Rhitsona</title>
                        [Cambridge 1934] pl. VI, 86.5-86</bibl>), is a worthy example of the
                    colorful, ornamental quality of much good Corinthian pottery. The painter has
                    filled almost the entire frieze with a large cock whose wings and feathers
                    spread out to encircle the alabastron. Comparable vases with cocks or Sirens

                    shape for the seventh century B.C., with broad, flat mouth, small, deep opening
                    and a perforated-pinched handle. Typical ornaments painted in dark glaze on the
                    mouth, neck and base. A zone of 15 solid rays radiate from the mouth; a row of
                    21 irregularly-spaced dots decorate the rim.. Six long rays enhance the neck
                    with one, larger than the others, on the handle. Twelve rays, similar to those
                    on the mouth, radiate from a small depression at the base. (These ornaments do

                    alabastron, a large figure representing Typhon faces right. His hair and beard
                    are long and wavy; he wears a small cap and a short-sleeved chiton decorated
                    with borders of wavy lines at the waist and shoulder. His colorful sickle-shaped
                    wings unfurl from his waist and back; a snaky tail emanates from the waist,
                    curves to form a circle below, then spreads upward under his right arm and
                    trails behind. The left arm and hand are held parallel to the waist; the right
                    arm drops at an angle. On the back, under the handle, a large swan walks to the
                    right. Incised lines indicate the beak, head and plumage. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red:</hi> Typhon's neck, central portion of his snaky

                <p>Alabastra are among the most popular Corinthian vase shapes. The Iowa
                    example is distinguished by its subject, not its shape. Hesiod (<bibl
                        n="Hes. Th. 820">Hes. Th. 820 ff.</bibl>)
                    provides the earliest account of Zeus's struggle against the monstrous Typhoeus
                    or Typhon, the offspring of Earth and Tartaros. The vivid literary descriptions
                    of this bizarre hybrid would tax any vase painter's skill and, indeed, most
                    showed a tamed, simplified creature compared to the prodigy imagined by the
                    poets. A Chalcidian hydria by the Inscription Painter (<rs type="vase"

                    Typically, the latter combines human and animal elements. He has a man's torso,
                    arms and bearded head (albeit with pointed ears) but the wings of a large bird.
                    Two snake tails emanate from his waist. He is not to be confused with
                    fish-tailed monsters such as Nereus: <rs type="vase">Athens, NM

                <p>The Typhon of Corinthian pottery is similar to that described above,
                    except that he has normal human ears and only one snake-tail. The wings are
                    almost always sickle-shaped. He never holds attributes (cf. <rs type="vase"

                        8, pl. 1, 3</bibl>). The motif itself appears in the Transitional Period but
                    is most common in the Early Corinthian period among artists of the Delos Group
                    (see <bibl>Benson 1953, 29, 38</bibl>). On
                    alabastra, Typhon may appear with a lion (<rs type="vase">Louvre CA

                       >Langlotz 1932, pl. 10</bibl>). The adaptability of Corinthian
                    motives is evident when vase painters press into service Typhon's sickle-shaped
                    wings and decorative chiton for figures of the <hi rend="ital"
                        >Potnia Theron</hi> (e.g., <rs type="vase">Louvre E 588</rs>:

                <p>Perhaps the most refined depiction of Typhon is on an alabastron in
                    the Scheurleer Museum (<rs type="vase">Scheurleer APS 715</rs>:
                        <bibl>CVA, Netherlands 1, The Hague 1, pl. 4,
                    2</bibl>). Here the elegantly coifed and elaborately dressed creature is more
                    dapper than frightening. The Iowa alabastron, like most, shows a less complex
                    rendition, especially in the simple treatment of incised detail on the chiton.
                    The most unusual feature of the depiction is the manner in which the tail curls
                    into a circle; all other examples known to me are S or U-shaped.</p>

                    with red stripes, above a band of abbreviated guilloche, s-curves with dots.
                    Band of rays at bottom and the sides of the shoulder are decorated with
                    impressive pendant rays, alternately red and black. Outline drawing for the

                    corner, pendant oval, hatched triangles, swastika, concentric circles with dots,
                    checkered triangle. Below the handle there is a rectangular panel with
                    horizontal wavy lines; the area above this is plain. Two vertical lines are on
                    each side of handle, the outer thin, the inner broad, with added red. At the
                    junction of the neck and shoulder, and on neck and mouth, black bands with added
                    red stripes. On the exterior of the mouth there are reserved triangles at the
                    base of the indentations of the trefoils, with smaller black triangles inside
                    these. For the handle, the center roll is black, the outer rolls are decorated
                    with short horizontal strokes; the rotelles are hatched on the outer face, black
                    on the handle side.</p>
                <p>R. M. Cook (1973) dated this oinochoe, and suggested an origin in or
                    near Chios. Indeed, several elements of decoration, when taken together, support
                    this: the white slip, the pinkish-buff clay, the sparse and neatly drawn filling
                    ornament ‚Äî particularly the pendent oval and the hatched triangle ‚Äî 
                    the goat's reserved belly-stripe with interior row of dots, the broken cable
                    pattern on the neck ‚Äî especially as it hooks from right to left ‚Äî
                    the extensive use of rays, and the size and configuration of the oinochoe. Chian
                    pottery of this period is of consistent, high quality; it has finesse and
                    control (compare <rs type="vase">Bloomington 72.144.4</rs>).</p>

                        >capra aegagrus,</hi> has wide distribution over Asia Minor, on Crete,
                    Rhodes, and many of the other Cycladic islands. Similar goats are depicted on
                    ancient Luristan and Scythian metalwork, see <bibl

                    Greek vases may have been inspired by designs from Near Eastern minor arts and
                    tapestries: see a row of reindeer on a rug from a Scythian tomb, <bibl

                <p>Pottery of similar East Greek style first came to light in modern
                    times at Naukratis in Egypt and it was dubbed "Naucratite," suggesting the place
                    of origin. But when more pieces of this fabric were discovered in yet earlier
                    archaeological contexts on Chios, the latter was seen as the pottery center.
                    There is controversy as to whether Chios was the exclusive place of manufacture
                    or whether, as Boardman feels, it was also made in Naukratis (<bibl

                    excellent. The top of the lid slopes gently up to a knob in the center. The knob
                    has a purple center; radiating from it are seven petals. Seven stepped triangles
                    fill in the spaces and are surrounded by three circles. A band of chevrons
                    covers the top and sides of the knob, with a wide black band below. Rays radiate
                    from the base of the knob, terminated by a checkered band framed by purple
                    lines. Below the frieze of animals is a purple band. The side of the lid is
                    vertical in profile. The underside of the lid is flat for 2 cm, and then a
                    sloping edge of 2 cm fits inside the mouth. Inside the sloping edge, the lid is
                    hollow. A broad stripe of black decorates the flat lip. Below are stripes of red
                    and black on the underside of the lip. Then three black bands and a band of
                    separated meanders in the form of "Z's" in reverse, with a dot in between. Then
                    three black, a wide red, and a double band, with another red above, frame the
                    main frieze. Below, many thin stripes of red and black surmounting black rays
                    which spring from the black base. Underneath the base, there is a flat base
                    ring, recessed 5.0 cm, which serves as the resting surface of the base. In the

                    consisting of an angle above, seven horizontal lines and an inverted angle
                    below. An arrangement of bands of purple, wide red, and another purple is placed
                    above the first animal frieze, between the two friezes and beneath the second
                    animal frieze. The lowest frieze consists of opposed vertical "S" loops
                    connected by crossed lines and a double horizontal line with inserted leaves.
                    The base of the egg-shaped amphora tapers up to a sharply molded rim. Around the
                    outer edge of the base there is a sharply raised molding which reflects the
                    shape of the lip. Around the base a red band is flanked by two white bands.
                    Underneath the base there is a flat ring base with a conical recess ‚Äî to
                    a depth of 4.5 cm ‚Äî with a slightly convex center.</p>

                <p>The style of the St. Louis Painter was identified by Professor J.
                    Szil√°gyi and of the three vases presently given to the painter, besides
                    the name vase here, another is in the Midwest: <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 24.872</rs> (<bibl>CVA, USA 15,
                        Cleveland 1, pls. 41.1 and 42.1</bibl>). Both vases‚Äîand a third in
                    Paris, <rs type="vase">Louvre E 634</rs>‚Äîare potted by the
                    same hand. "The twofold technique which the St. Louis Painter uses to render the
                    inner details of the animals is particularly characteristic: surprisingly thin
                    lines of incision on the hindquarters and head, sometimes the ribs as well, and
                    white added dots on the chest" (<bibl
                        >Szil√°gyi, "St. Louis Painter," <title>infra</title>,
                        p. 8</bibl>). Dots on the necks of animals appear in East Greek
                    vase-painting (see <rs type="vase">Columbia 71.113</rs>) but the
                    St. Louis Painter's use of white dots seems to bring out, in a unique way, the
                    inner structure of the chest, shoulders and back (<hi rend="ital"
                        >ibid.</hi>)</p>
                <p>In his article (difficult to locate in American libraries)
                    Szil√°gyi provides insight into the numerous stylistic forces which bear
                    upon the Etrusco-Corinthian vase-painter's craft. For instance, a Chimaera on
                    the Paris amphora appears to be unique as a particular type in
                    Etrusco-Corinthian vase-painting and closely follows Corinthian models. Another
                    motif, the "kneeling bull," on the Paris amphora, is an old and wide-spread
                    motif in Near Eastern art and it originally seems to have indicated an attacking
                    gesture in a fight with a beast or hero. In Greece this motif appears variously,
                    e.g. an archaic pediment found on the Acropolis of Athens (<rs type="sculpture"
                       >Athens, Acr. 4</rs>).</p>
                <p>On the Cleveland amphora the rendering of the eye of a grazing stag
                    (in the top frieze) is reserved, with a black dot for the pupil, in a way known
                    in East Greek pottery. Grazing here is indicated not only by the inclined head
                    but by the leaf in the stag's mouth and this motif exists in orientalizing
                    Etruscan art and elsewhere. However, the motif on the Cleveland vase is unique.
                    Instead of eating the usual vegetable matter, the stag grazes on a petal of the
                    large rosette directly in front. "The large rosette... is transformed from a
                    space-filling decoration into something alive: it sprouts small rosettes and the
                    leaf as well which the stag is about to chew off" (<bibl
                       >"St. Louis Painter," <title>infra,</title> p.
                        9</bibl>). This active genre group is repeated on the Paris amphora. The
                    ornamental motif which, in this configuration, fills the bottom register on the
                    St. Louis vase and on the other two amphorae as well, appears to be unique.</p>
                <p>That the St. Louis amphora and the Paris vase were by the same hand
                    was noticed by Betty Grossman (<bibl><title

                    <hi rend="ital">Animal frieze:</hi> Three bands, two of animals
                    separated by one with scale designs. The uppermost band consists of two panthers
                    facing a central Siren (r.) and the bottom frieze has two panthers facing a stag
                    (r.) with an additional panther (r.). The scales around the middle of the vase
                    are large and compassdrawn; each is doubly incised, and decorated alternately
                    with diagonal rows of small white and large red dots. Various encircling lines,
                    tongues at base of neck, series of dots on edge of mouth, small depression
                    underneath vase.</p>
                <p>This vase belongs to a large and fairly hospitable Group, one main
                    feature of which is its use of bands of scale pattern, and of "incised
                    verticals" in combination with animal friezes. The shapes are mainly alabastra
                    and round and flat-bottomed aryballoi. As Payne observed (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, 63</bibl>), the Group "derives directly from the
                    early period," but its origins can be traced as far back as the Transitional
                    (see his remarks [p. 286] on nos. 169-170 as antecedent to the style of nos.
                    457-458, which are now believed to be early works of the Scale Painter).</p>
                <p>The two leading artists of the Group are the Scale Painter and the
                    Hermitage Painter. The Milwaukee alabastron was decorated by one of the less
                    prolific artists of the Group, thus far known from only two pieces, this one and
                    the name-vase, Stockholm 1654. However, the quality is very good, and further
                    attributions may in time be expected.</p>
                <p>The Group remains active throughout the Middle Corinthian period, and
                    apparently into Late Corinthian I, but the later works tend to be perfunctory or
                    nondescript.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> In animal friezes,
                    reading rightward from handle: Upper: Siren to right, wings raised above back;
                    flying bird to right, between seated Sphinxes with raised sickle-shaped wings,
                    between panthers; standing women to left. Lower: panther facing stag; floral
                    cross between lion and panther; small owl between lion and panther; goat facing
                    lion. Red is freely used for interior details of animals and floral cross.
                    Varied filling ornament, consisting mainly of incised rosettes (eight, six, and
                    four petals; none with centers), "sheaf rosettes," irregular blobs, dots. There
                    are some minor oddities and inconsistencies of rendering. Details of floral
                    pattern are not symmetrical; goat has incised "collar" (two parallel lines,
                    zigzag line between them); paired horizontal strokes often appear on legs of
                    quadrupeds; Sphinxes' wings have incised feathers lying far <hi rend="ital"
                       >within</hi> black-glazed areas which determine their contours;
                    the two back-to-back lions have intertwined tails, but lion at left has no base
                    to his tail (this area is damaged, but not enough to account for this
                    peculiarity). In both friezes, there is a tendency to crowd the figures, a
                    feature which is cleverly exploited in one instance, where a lion is made to
                    bite into the goat's horn.</p>
                <p>There are two distinct types of broad-bottomed oinochoe. One (A) has
                    a broad, short neck and a wide mouth; the other (B) has a tall narrow neck and
                    small mouth, and a plastic "collar" around its neck. (The name "oinochoe" is
                    conventional, and the two types may have been designed for different uses.) The
                    Bloomington oinochoe is of type B. Its fairly steep shoulder and slightly
                    inward-curving lower body allow it to be placed reasonably accurately within the
                    series. Typologically, it is slightly more developed than the Early Corinthian
                    examples which were decorated by the Duel Painter (<bibl
                       >D. A. Amyx <title>CSCA 2</title> [1969] pl.
                    3</bibl>), the Heraldic Lions Painter (<rs type="vase">Athens, NM
                        927</rs>, <bibl>Payne 1931, no. 746,
                    unpublished</bibl>), and the Royal Library Painter (<bibl

                        [1969] 21, no. 18, unpublished</bibl>). On the other hand, it is distinctly
                    earlier than any of the large mass of such oinochoai which were produced in the
                    Dodwellian school (see <rs type="vase">Madison 70.3</rs>), and
                    apparently even earlier than the flashy, double-rayed specimen in Taranto by the
                    Nimes Painter (<bibl><title>AS
                        Atene</title> 21-22 [1959-60] 135-139 and figs. 111b, 113-114</bibl>), which
                    must stand at or very near the beginning of Middle Corinthian. On the
                    Bloomington vase, in spite of some early-looking features, such as the two tiers
                    of vertical wavy lines on the neck and the painted guilloche on the handle-back,
                    both of which were already at home in Protocorinthian and tended to die out in
                    Early Corinthian, there are other indications which point to a later date, as
                    was suggested by the shape. The size and number of the base rays, as well as the
                    somewhat slurred rendering of the checkerboard pattern of "dicing" between the
                    two animal friezes are, as is the figure style, indicative of a position on the
                    border-line between Early and Middle Corinthian.</p>
                <p>The style, thus far, is uniquely represented on this vase. No other
                    work by this hand has as yet been found. It is, however, a very distinctive
                    style, and attributable pieces, when they do appear, should be easy to
                    recognize. The rendering of the Sphinxes and of the panthers seems to be
                    especially diagnostic. The style is somewhat "wild" and unorthodox, but
                    thoroughly competent. It is coarser and bolder than that of the mature Early
                    Corinthian "refined" practitioners, such as the Royal Library Painter (<bibl
                       >CSCA 2 [1969] 19-22, List E</bibl>) and the
                    Heraldic Lions Painter (<bibl>AJA 70 [1966]
                    297</bibl>), but not so rough as that of the Nimes Painter (<bibl
                       >AJA 65 [1961] 9f</bibl>). On the bold side of Early
                    Corinthian, there are generic likenesses to the works of such artists as the

                    the one in the center hold a drinking-horn in the right hand. In front of each
                    couch, there is a table laden with food. Between every two couches, a lyre hangs
                    on the wall. A young servant approaches at left, an oinochoe in his right hand,
                    his left arm extended. <hi rend="ital">Side B,</hi> three horsemen
                    moving to left: they wear helmets and carry round shields decorated with
                    whirligig blazons, and two spears. Behind each rider, a bird flying to left. At
                    right a snake (?). Beneath each handle, a pair of confronted seated panthers
                    with heads turned back. <hi rend="ital">Lower,</hi> animal frieze:

                <p>This vase is the name-piece of the Detroit Painter, a companion and
                    follower of the Medallion Painter. Six other vases, all of them column kraters,
                    have been attributed to his hand by D. A. Amyx (<bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 196-197, A, nos. 1-3 and 5-7</bibl>): <rs

                        >Villa Giulia 46197</rs>; Riehen, Private (once Basel market). Of these
                    pieces, <rs type="vase">Louvre E 630</rs>, offers the closest
                    comparable decorative scheme to that of the krater in Detroit. Possibly by the
                    Detroit Painter, according to Amyx, are the fragment <rs type="vase"
                       >Bonn 374.19</rs> and <rs type="vase">Cerveteri,
                        BUF 999/67622</rs>, both column kraters (<bibl
                        >Amyx 1988, p. 197, AP, nos. 1-2</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Detroit Painter exhibits a loose and careless style, which is
                    redeemed only by the rather better workmanship on the krater in the Villa
                    Giulia. His favorite subjects are: the banquet scene, with which he decorated
                        <rs type="vase">Louvre CP 10479</rs>, <rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre E 630</rs>, and the Detroit krater; horsemen, which
                    appear on all his known works; the animal frieze. On the krater in New York, he
                    also illustrated, among other themes, a version of the wedding of Paris and
                    Helen, complete with inscriptions.</p>
                <p>Our painter was first recognized by J. L. Benson, who placed him in
                    the manner of his "Three Maidens Painter" (<bibl
                        >Benson 1953, 50, sub List 82</bibl> [<hi rend="ital">"Art des
                        Dreim√§dchenmalers"</hi>]). On Benson's "Three Maidens Group," see most
                    recently <bibl>Amyx 1988, 294</bibl>). In a later
                    publication, Benson named the artist the "Banquet Scene Painter," after the
                    principal subjects on the two Louvre kraters mentioned above and the krater in
                    Detroit (<bibl>AJA 60 [1956] 228 and n. 63</bibl>).
                    It was Amyx who first suggested the name "Detroit Painter" which has now become
                    fixed in the literature (<bibl>AJA 65 [1961] 1of.,
                        n. 31</bibl>). This scholar pointed out the close relationship between the
                    Detroit Painter and the Medallion Painter, a distinguished Middle Corinthian
                    artist with a long career and several followers. Both vase-painters are members
                    of the Gorgoneion Group, an important cluster of Middle Corinthian painters of
                    column kraters and cups, which was put together by H. Payne (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, 103 and 311f.</bibl>) and later expanded by Amyx
                        (<bibl>AJA 65 [1961]1-15</bibl>). Although the
                    career of the Medallion Painter extends into the Late Corinthian I period, that
                    of the Detroit Painter seems thus far to be entirely Middle Corinthian.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 18.3 cm; W. 16.5 cm.
                    Intact: much of the glaze on neck and mouth has crackled and flaked; applied red
                    ranges in color from cherry to rust-brown and the black glaze itself is vitreous
                    in places but also granular and dull. Areas are obviously repainted and lines of
                    earlier incision are visible on the bottom of the wing of the Siren (right) in
                    the small animal frieze.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Large animal frieze:</hi> central lion (r.) flanked
                    by a pair of stags, panthers, and goats (all facing the lion); a swan (r.) under
                    the handle. <hi rend="ital">Small frieze:</hi> centrally placed
                    swan (r. with reverted head) with pairs of facing Sirens, goats, and swans (both
                    l. but one with reverted head); zone of 98 rays at base.</p>
                <p>The vase is a broad-bottomed oinochoe, a shape favored in the Middle
                    Corinthian period especially by the Dodwell Painter and his circle; certain
                    aspects of style also show the Elvehjem Painter's proximity to this group (see
                        <rs type="vase">St. Louis 174.1924</rs>). The shoulder
                    enclosure for the felines, designed like a great bean, and the "arrested" pose
                    in which the cats have been cast, with the front legs fixed and together, the
                    massive hind legs astride, are characteristic features of the Dodwell Painter
                    and those near him. The Madison hand is further determined by the feline's
                    shoulder-casing which is often partially open at the bottom, over the near
                    foreleg, and rounded at the top, having a single line of incision for interior
                    accent and two parallel strokes which run down the length of each foreleg, from
                    the lower shoulder to the first joint or ankle. Based upon the few vases
                    attributed to him, the Elvehjem Painter does not represent the human form ‚Äî
                     except perhaps for a charming doodle of a woman's head on a vase in Munich
                        (<bibl>Moon, <title
                        >infra,</title> p. 386, fig. 12</bibl>) ‚Äî and even in his repertoire
                    of animals and fabulosi he is not venturesome with unusual types. His filling
                    ornament is spidery and careful on earlier pieces. Ruminants are common and are
                    designed with high croupers, three broad arcs on the hind flank and a small
                    reverse are often in advance of these, two concentric arcs at the front of a red
                    bellystripe, a single sweep of the graver for the shoulder, and three or four
                    vertical lines for the ribs (see <rs type="vase">Chicago

                    heights at the base line; in the very center, below, a somewhat abstract
                    palmette; on top, a hanging half rosette (with a triangular interior subdivision
                    and an outer border of small squares in between a double line); at the left, a
                    large, now rather faded, quatrefoil rosette. Spoked-wheel rosettes, dot-rosettes
                    and cross-designs are scattered, spaciously. Three registers of "crescents," the
                    middle one in reverse direction, each register separated by a row of dots
                    bounded by thin lines. A row of simple strokes (tongue patterns) at the base of
                    the neck, and a meander band on the neck. There is a square, in brown glaze,
                    drawn at the base of the handle and the reverse is otherwise decorated with
                    rays. There are now only traces of added red on the decoration. For a brief

                    <hi rend="ital">Panel:</hi> Siren (r.) with raised wing. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added red:</hi> a broad area of red for the chest,
                    neck, back and face of Siren, fillet in hair and wide stripe at base of tail;
                    alternate petals and cuff of palmette configuration directly behind Siren,
                    alternate petals and centers of rosettes, for opposite pairs of petals for the
                    star-florals on the left side of picture panel only. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> dots between petals of palmette and rosettes,
                    on the inner edge of Siren's wing; tiny dots accentuating the jewelry-chains
                    binding hair; others, larger, for earring and tear duct. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Reverse:</hi> reserved triangles, perhaps suggesting an eye.</p>
                <p>The beige slip and filling ornament recall earlier Corinthian pottery
                    and the Siren brings to mind the seventh century, dominated by fabulous
                    creatures and uncommon animals. The Gorgon Painter depicts only one Siren
                    instead of a parade, as in Corinth, of natural or fabulous beasts; this sense of
                    focus is chiefly Attic. This is the time in vase-painting when the human figure
                    is put into its own register or panel, when animals are increasingly relegated
                    to a position of secondary importance and when, with a new sense of order,
                    elements not belonging together are at last separated. The Gorgon Painter is one
                    of the first decorators for whom we have vases of sufficient number and quality
                    with which to follow these developments (<bibl
                        >Scheibler 1961, p. 24</bibl>). His great dinos in Paris, <rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre E 874</rs> (<bibl>ABV, 8,
                        no. 1</bibl>), is ample illustration. Nonetheless, the Kansas City Olpe
                    seems later in his career and even in his maturity the Gorgon Painter still
                    displays much that is old-fashioned. Compared to the artistry of Sophilos, the
                    KX and KY Painters (see <bibl>Moon 1979,
                    no.24</bibl>), his work seems stiff and formal; that same impulse toward
                    monumentality and concentration on a single motif denied a certain vigor.</p>
                <p>The vase was attributed by E. Paribeni and this identification was
                    accepted by Beazley (<bibl>Para., 7, no. 13
                    quater</bibl>.) Even though his production lasted only twenty years or so the
                    Gorgon Painter throughout favored the olpe and there was a noticeable change in
                    the shape of the vase from his earliest to latest. An olpe at Athens, found at
                    Vari (<bibl>ABV, 9, no. 16</bibl>), is
                    characteristic of his first olpai in that the form rises more quickly and closes
                    less noticeably with a wide mouth. The rosettes and filling ornament are
                    symmetrical, the petals trim and neat; the designs are not yet in panels. In the
                    next decade, both in Athens and in Corinth, the olpe became taller, the neck
                    more distinct (<bibl>Hopper 1949, p. 237</bibl>).
                    The Kansas City olpe belongs here along with, among others, an olpe in Hamburg,
                    Museum f√ºr Kunst und Gewerbe (<rs type="vase">Hamburg
                    1960</rs>; <bibl>Para., 7, no. 13 bis</bibl>). The
                    filling elements are now spidery. Many more of the olpai date to his later
                    periods and these vases were frequently imitated by students, the Gorgon Painter
                    having apparently established what was a large workshop (<bibl
                       >Scheibler 1961, p. 20</bibl>). Certain details of style on
                    the Kansas City olpe are difficult to trace in the master's work: the pointed
                    nose, sharp chin, and the Siren's small head and elongated body. The top of this
                    Siren's head seems too flat, the hairband is at an odd angle and the layers of
                    hair at the nape of the neck seem somewhat wooden. The Sirens on a plate in
                    Baltimore, <rs type="vase">Walters Art Gallery 48.215</rs> (<bibl
                       >ABV, 9, no. 18</bibl>), are comparable in some
                    respects but the faces and shape of their heads are noticeably different:
                    rounded crown, pronounced lips, and protruding jaw. These differences may be
                    accountable to qualitative or chronological change or, as one suspects, the olpe
                    in Kansas City may have been decorated by a very talented student. For the olpai
                    of the Gorgon Painter, see <bibl>Scheibler

                <p>Band of nine broadly spaced rays at base. Each animal frieze is
                    bounded, above and below, with a pair of added stripes: a wide red and a fine
                    white. Inside neck at top: three stripes, a wide red between two white. The top,
                    edge and underside of lip are reserved, except near the rotelles (ears) in back
                    which are glazed. Inside of neck glazed, handle glazed (thinly on the inner
                    side), rotelles glazed with spidery rosettes in white. Three white star-rosettes
                    randomly on neck, one, near handle, in a circle. White daubs on the ridge
                    (raised fillet) which separates the neck from the body; red stripe on outer edge
                    of base, the underside of which is entirely reserved, with the central half
                    slightly indented.</p>
                <p>The vase is finely potted, the body made in two equal sections with
                    the point of join at the upper border of zone three. The three ribs on the strap
                    handle were made by a sharply-wedged tool or comb; the indented circle under the
                    base gives added strength and refinement. The shape and schemes of decoration
                    were obviously inspired by Corinthian olpai, such as those in the exhibition by
                    the Painter of Vatican 73 (see <bibl>Moon 1979, no.
                        5</bibl>). Unlike many Corinthian clays, the fabric here is not friable
                    ‚Äî the designs have not flaked ‚Äî and it is stronger ‚Äî which
                    allows for larger vase shapes. Only at first glance do the animals seem
                    imitative of Corinthian; their open mouth and occasionally puzzled expressions
                    (especially of the animals in the second frieze), their lack of uniformity and
                    the lack of attention to detail in their rendering, seem essentially Etruscan in
                    spirit. There is something comical in these lumbering forms. Some (doe and ox in
                    zone two) practically defy identification. The popularity of Corinthian styles
                    among the Etruscans is discussed in description of <rs type="vase"
                        >Kansas City 47-43</rs>. The olpe was in the Hearst collection and was sold
                    as item no. 96 in the Parke-Bernet auction, 1963. Many of the animals have
                    "nozzle noses" which seem to be reminiscent of Corinthian artists like the
                    Ampersand Painter (see <rs type="vase">Chicago 1905.343</rs>), in

                    pyxis with upright handles. Characteristically his ruminants forage, noses to
                    the ground (often they have peculiar noses shaped like nozzles) with their
                    croups very high in the air; felines have a type of ear-marking resembling a "w"

                    small and compact, having almost insect-like qualities of staring eyes and
                    pointed muzzle; in the shoulder enclosure of the quadrupeds there is frequently
                    a row of red dots following its contour and, rarely, a similar progression of
                    dots on the stems of some florals.</p>
                <p>The newly christened Elvehjem Painter (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Madison 70.3</rs>) is stylistically very close to the Ampersand
                    Painter. Both were perhaps from the same workshop, that of the Dodwell Painter,
                    the foremost practitioner in the city of Corinth during the Middle Corinthian
                    period of vase-painting. The shoulder complex for the felines, which is shaped
                    like a giant bean, the "arrested" pose of the cats, i.e., with front legs fixed
                    and together and with massive hind legs astride, and the cat's alert stare are
                    highly indicative of the Dodwellian group of painters.</p>
                <p>The Elvehjem Painter uses dots of glaze in series as ornament in the
                    field, near the shoulder enclosure of many of his animals, while the Ampersand
                    Painter, with similar effect, occasionally uses dots in added red inside the
                    enclosures. For the development of the pyxis at Corinth: <bibl

                    broken and mended from seven fragments; small repair in plaster above head of
                    lioness, some repainting over joins; some loss of paint, especially in area of
                    hindquarters of lioness. Convex rim grooved near the edge and pierced twice for
                    suspension above head of lioness; double base-ring. Decoration in dark brown
                    (black) and red paint on buff ground. On obverse, concentric black and red
                    bands-three around figural tondo and three along rim; on reverse, two concentric
                    black bands directly beneath rim, six concentric black and red bands within
                    base-ring, which is painted black and red.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Within tondo, the
                    monumental figure of a lioness crouching to the right with her head turned back
                    and her front paws pressed against the edge of the tondo. Around her in the
                    field are one single and seven double rosettes. The lioness has been given a
                    mane, perhaps to emphasize her monumentality. <hi rend="ital">Added
                        red:</hi> details of head and ruff, neck, part of shoulder enclosure, ribs,
                    lower part of belly, and stripes on flank; cores and alternate petals of
                    rosettes.</p>
                <p>The plate was attributed to the Chimaera Painter by Dr. Herbert A.
                    Cahn. It is one of thirteen plates decorated by this artist, who was one of the
                    finest draughtsmen in Corinthian black-figure. Nine other vases have been
                    attributed to his hand, including one aryballos, four pyxides, and four lekanoid
                    bowls. In the power and balance of its composition and the precision of its
                    drawing, the Cincinnati plate ranks among the best works of the Chimaera
                    Painter.</p>
                <p>Our vase finds its closest parallel in a plate in the Louvre, from
                    Corinth, attributed to the artist by Payne (<bibl
                        >Payne 1931, no. 1041</bibl>; <bibl>Amyx 1988,
                        168, no. A-14</bibl>). The crouching lioness within the tondo of this piece
                    is an almost exact counterpart of the feline on the Cincinnati plate. As a
                    floral accompaniment to the Louvre lioness, however, the Chimaera Painter has
                    chosen a single large lotus placed beneath the animal's belly, rather than a
                    field of rosettes. The plate in the Louvre is of comparable quality to the one
                    in Cincinnati and must have been painted at about the same time.</p>
                <p>Also worthy of comparison to the magnificent lioness of the
                    Cincinnati plate is the Chimaera on an approximately contemporary plate in New
                    York, possibly from Attica, attributed to the Chimaera Painter by Richter (<bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 168, no. A-13</bibl>); a somewhat
                    earlier lion decorating the interior of a lekanoid bowl in the British Museum,
                    one of Payne's attributions to the painter (<bibl
                        >Payne 1931, no. 1009</bibl>; <bibl>Amyx 1988,
                        168, no. A-7</bibl>); and the lions crouching back-to-back on a plate in
                    Mykonos, from Rheneia, a late work of our artist, which was recognized by Payne
                        (<bibl>Payne 1931, no. 1042</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 169, no. A-18</bibl>). A fragmentary
                    lekanoid bowl in Corinth preserves part of a lioness in a pose similar to that
                    on the Cincinnati plate (<bibl>Payne 1931, no. 1010,
                        part</bibl>; <bibl>Amyx 1988, 168, no.
                    A-8</bibl>); another lioness may have been the subject of a very fragmentary
                    plate in Catania, from the Demeter Sanctuary (<bibl
                        >Amyx 1988, 168, no. A-16</bibl>). Both of these works by the Chimaera
                    Painter are of lesser quality than his masterpieces with lionesses in Cincinnati
                    and the Louvre.</p>
                <p>The Chimaera Painter was first recognized by Humfry Payne, who put
                    together the central group of plates from his hand and named the artist after a
                    key piece done in his prime, the plate <rs type="vase">Vienna iv
                        1624</rs> decorated with the figure of the Chimaera to right against a field
                    of rosettes (<bibl>Payne 1931, no. 1040</bibl>;
                        <bibl>Amyx 1988, 168, no. A-12</bibl>). This
                    piece, like the one in Cincinnati, exhibits the chief characteristics of the
                    painter's style, namely, his monumentality, precise drawing, rich dichromy, and
                    his treatment of the tondo of the plate as a single field for one or at the most
                    two figures. The majority of Corinthian artists, for whom the plate was never a
                    favorite shape, fill the tondo with friezes of animals. As decoration for his
                    plates and bowls, the Chimaera Painter generally prefers monsters, such as the
                    Chimaera, or lions or lionesses, or mythological figures, as, for example, the
                    Artemis with swans on a plate in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (<bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 168, no. A-10; pl. 64:2a-b</bibl>). His pyxides
                    are decorated with animal friezes, though never in a routine style; his
                    flat-bottomed aryballos carries a lotus-cross between panthers (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, no. 835</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 167, no. A-1</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Chimaera Painter is the central artist of the Chimaera Group, one
                    of Payne's five principal subdivisions of Middle Corinthian vase-painting. His
                    closest companions are The Painter of the Copenhagen Sphinxes, whose namepiece
                    is a plate in the National Museum, Copenhagen, displaying two confronted bearded
                    sphinxes, (<bibl>Payne 1931, no. 1054</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, 170, below, no. A-1; pl.
                    65:1a-b</bibl>), and the Painter of Louvre E 574, both of whom some scholars
                    mistakenly consider to be one artist. The Chimaera Group also includes the
                    Riehen Painter, whom Lawrence separated from the original list of the Painter of
                    Louvre E 574 (<bibl>AJA 66 [1962] 186</bibl>), and
                    the Carrousel Painter, an older companion of the Chimaera Painter, recognized
                    independently by both Lawrence and Callipolitis-Feytmans (<bibl

                <p>The deep cup or kotyle (often called a skyphos) which appears in Late
                    Corinthian Geometric, is one of the major shapes for Corinthian proper, and
                    remains popular until early Hellenistic times. Considered from the point of view
                    of shape and proportion our vase fits neatly into a large group of Middle and
                    Late Corinthian kotylai. The diameter of the foot is slightly more than half
                    (0.53) the diameter of the mouth. More important, the foot-ring profile and its
                    decoration strongly suggest a Middle Corinthian date. For an excellent
                    discussion of the shape's development see <bibl>Amyx

                <p>The syntax of the vase again adheres closely to the Middle Corinthian
                    canon (cf. <bibl>Payne 1931, pl. 33, 1, 3, 7-9,
                    11</bibl> and <bibl>CVA, Denmark 2, Copenhagen 2,
                        pl. 91</bibl>). Our artist derived his figures from his older and more
                    talented colleagues. The Dodwell Painter, an influential artist of early Middle
                    Corinthian vases, is credited with a fine pyxis (<rs type="vase"

                    and "diluted" them by employing only one of the complex original elements on
                    either side of the kotyle (crows replace Sphinxes on A; a bird replaces the
                    Siren on B; for the latter cf. <bibl>C. Dugas,

                    kotyle stands near the beginning of this process. It maintains a certain
                    respectable grace through the careful incision of its hybrid creatures,
                    especially the Sphinxes, and the delicate use of added color. It has only a hint
                    of that perfunctory quality which characterizes the paintings on most kotylai of
                    the next generation of Corinthian artists.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 10.5 cm; W. 28.7 cm;
                    D. of mouth 19.9 cm; D. of foot 7.6 cm. Mended from a few large fragments with a
                    restored area in plaster on each side of the vase through the figure scene and
                    another restoration on the off-set lip, above the florals, near handle B/A. On
                    Side A (the better preserved) the design is lacking only the torso of the dancer
                    on the left; on B the mid section of the dancer in the center, the upper torso
                    and head of the dancer on the right and the top of the head and facial details
                    of the dancer on the left are missing. The handles, foot and the entire interior
                    of the cup are glazed. The glazing is thick and rich, especially vitreous.
                    Insides of the handles, the edge and inside of the foot are reserved. On the
                    underside of the foot-plate a black glazed circle marks the point of descent
                    between the flat resting surface and the deep cone. In similar fashion a black
                    line emphasizes the junction of the off-set lip to the cup. A reserve line is at
                    the top of the lip and a black line is at the outer edge, toward the drinker.
                    The clay is warm red-orange.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The subject is the same
                    on each side of the cup: three padded dancers, the one in the middle and the
                    fellow behind dance to the left, while the one in front (on the left) faces
                    them, dancing to the right. Their heads are lowered, arms raised, as they dance
                    spiritedly. Rosettes, incised, on the off-set lip; under each handle an
                    arrangement of a palmette fan atop a big lotus flower, the whole joined by
                    tendrils. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> torso and buttock pads
                    worn by dancers; alternate petals both of rosettes and palmette fans and for the
                    fans within lotus flowers; cuffs of lotus flowers, hearts and roots of
                    palmettes. The lotuses in the configuration to the right of Side A have, above
                    the red cuff, a band of abbreviated meanders; in the other arrangement this band
                    is red.</p>
                <p>H. R. W. Smith's rule of thumb for the differences in subsidiary
                    decoration between the KY Painter and the KX Painter, a slightly older
                    contemporary and possibly a pupil of the Gorgon Painter (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Kansas City 59.22</rs>) was that the latter prefers florals
                    which are nearer Corinthian in design while the former, as one sees on this cup,
                    uses the newer, eventually traditional, Attic arrangement. A skyphos by the KY
                    Painter (<rs type="vase">Bloomington 74.6.5</rs>, also unpublished)
                    as Professor Amyx informally pointed out, has a Corinthian floral on one side of
                    the padded dancers and an Attic configuration on the other ‚Äî the skyphos
                    at Bloomington was too fragile to travel to this exhibition. This Madison cup is
                    undoubtedly by the KY Painter because of the composition ‚Äî three dancers,
                    the middle and right figure facing and moving left, the remaining one opposed
                    ‚Äî and because of the figure style ‚Äî feet incised with three or
                    four parallel lines, long plain hands, high foreheads. For the history of the
                    shape, iconography and discussion of the painter see <bibl

                <p>Dietrich von Bothmer christened this painter, and besides this vase
                    in Omaha, attributed another, a Tyrrhenian style ovoid neck-amphora in Paris,
                        <rs type="vase">Louvre E 861</rs>, to the same hand; Beazley
                    agreed with this new personality (<bibl>Para., 33,
                        bottom and 34, top</bibl>). The amphora in the Louvre has similar schemes of
                    subsidiary decoration: addorsed lotus and palmettes (more carefully incised) on
                    the neck; tongue-patterns at the base of the neck; floral frieze beneath the
                    picture zone (alternating lotus buds instead of lotus and palmettes in this
                    position on the name vase); a frieze of avians ‚Äî Sirens and swans with
                    raised wings; a wide black band; zone of double rays. Though it seems somewhat
                    importunate to discuss with certainty the style of a painter for whom we have
                    only two vases, this decorator exhibits a similar attitude toward narrative on
                    each piece: principals in the center, with attendants ‚Äî usually three
                    ‚Äî facing on either side. Zeus gives birth to Athena with Olympian
                    onlookers on Side A of the Paris amphora. Side B presents a series of
                    high-stepping musicians while Side B on the Omaha vase shows a row of banqueters
                    (see <rs type="vase">Detroit 24.119</rs>). As the name "Tyrrhenian"
                    implies, these vases were intended for the Etruscan market, where their scenes
                    of musicians and banqueters would have been popular, as later surviving Etruscan
                    tomb paintings demonstrate.</p>
                <p>The previous owner, Mathias Komor, in a letter to the Joslyn Museum
                    attributed the Omaha vase to the Castellani Painter for whom we now recognize
                    about forty vases. Although there are similarities, one can readily distinguish
                    one from the other. The Castellani Painter nearly always uses two animal friezes
                    following the florals under the picture zone (exceptions: three animal
                        friezes,<rs type="vase">Louvre E 831</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 103, no. 108</bibl>; additional narrative frieze plus
                    two animal friezes, Rome market, <bibl>ABV, 97, no.
                        25</bibl>; no frieze, <rs type="vase">Louvre E 867</rs>; <bibl

                       >von Bothmer 1957, 10, no. 47</bibl>). The Castellani Painter
                    seldom separates the zone of rays from the second animal frieze, as the Omaha
                    Painter does with the wide band of black (<rs type="vase"
                        >Civitavecchia 1706</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 99, no.
                    60</bibl>; <bibl>von Bothmer 1957, 7, no. 18</bibl>
                    is said to have a black zone). Both painters use a <hi rend="ital"
                        >protome</hi> of a panther as a shield device; such a device is
                    characteristic of the Castellani Painter (<bibl>D.

                            >AJA</title> 48 [1944] 165</bibl>). The panther <hi rend="ital"
                       >protome</hi> on the warrior's shield on Side A of Omaha
                    Painter's name vase stands high; one is quickly reminded of the shield devices
                    displayed by the Affecter (see <rs type="vase">Omaha 1953.255</rs>)
                    on the rare hydria, coincidentally from the same museum. The panther devices for
                    the Castellani Painter are in added color, painted directly on the shield face.
                    Among other subjects the Castellani Painter prefers Amazonomachies, some of
                    which remind one of the composition on Side A of the Omaha vase: <rs type="vase"

                <p>At that time of rising competition for foreign sales in ceramics,
                    when Corinthian potters and painters of the red-ground style were imitating the
                    clay color and size of Attic vases (see <rs type="vase">St. Louis
                        WU 3267</rs>), Attic practitioners, toward the same commercial ends, needed
                    to improve their own production of small vases, notably drinking cups, and they
                    copied the Corinthian miniaturist size and style. The "Siana cups" ‚Äî
                    named after an early find-spot ‚Äî progress from the Corinthian and Attic
                    "komast" cups (see <rs type="vase">Madison 1979.310</rs>); at this
                    time the Athenians also borrowed the Corinthian kotyle (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Davenport AR 47.40</rs>). "Siana cup" is an Attic black-figure
                    cup with off-set lip and stout, flaring foot. In terms of motives, Athenians
                    borrowed: decorative pairs of dueling warriors, mounted youths, frontal horses,
                    fabulous demons, elaborate florals and ornate borders. In fact, so extensive are
                    the borrowings from Corinth in the works of the painter of this cup, that
                    Beazley christened him the "C" (Corinthianizing) Painter (<bibl
                       >MMS, infra, p. 100</bibl>). If it were not for the
                    pink-orange clay of his pots, which is Attic, and the technique of applying
                    added white over the black glaze, which is also Attic, one might think him a
                    Corinthian.</p>
                <p>Many aspects of drawing point clearly to the "C" Painter's hand: the
                    warriors' pigtail-like hair, "V" notch for elbow and knee cap, the
                    square-muzzled lion's head (shield device and Chimaera), the size and shape of
                    the warriors' buttocks, and typical areas of applied paint ‚Äî red for the
                    inside of some shields, red on helmets, white dots around the shield. In style
                    of drawing, the St. Louis cup is close to a cup in Athens (<rs type="vase"
                       >Athens, NM 532</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 52,
                        no. 12</bibl>) and to another in Paris (<rs type="vase">Louvre
                        F 65</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 52, no. 11</bibl>); the
                    use of the graver is generally more sparing and details for faces, horses'
                    manes, and clothing are more synoptic, e.g., the warriors are not provided with
                    greaves. Added color on his vases was often applied with an eye for contrast,
                    for decorative effects; in this regard one is reminded of Corinthian painters of
                    the red-ground style who are contemporary. The squires, for example, sport a red
                    mantle on one shoulder and a white one on the other, one obviously theirs, the
                    other belonging to the master. The elderly bearded figures are dressed in white
                    chitons and black himatia, the latter with red sleeves. The "C" Painter's
                    manipulation of shield devices, which are chiefly "heads" of various
                    description, when in series, e.g., around the top of the tripod pyxis (<rs
                        type="vase">Louvre CA 616</rs>; <bibl
                       >MMS, infra, fig. 21</bibl>) give the impression of a
                    decorative Corinthian animal frieze. This exotic appeal combined with the
                    painter's vitality anticipate the artistry of the Amasis Painter, the Affecter,
                    and the Painter of Berlin 1686 (see <rs type="vase">Champaign
                        70.9.3</rs>; <rs type="vase">Chicago 1978.114</rs>; <bibl

                    Chimaera in the tondo does not have its tail in the form of a snake; this
                    tradition of representation is Corinthian (<bibl

                    <hi rend="ital">Panel:</hi> a large, carefully drawn arrangement of
                    palmette fan and lotus flower, with voluted tendrils and buds, is flanked,
                    heraldically, first by facing cocks then by youths on horseback. Each youth
                    wears a short chiton, carries a spear in the left hand and reins, incised, in
                    the right. Vertical lines establish the panel, with a large flower bud on each
                    side, to fill space. The shoulder, separated from the panel by a faint line in
                    dilute, has a frieze of palmette and lotus. There are tongue-patterns above
                    this, at the base of the neck, and tongues cover the foot. Underneath the panel
                    is a net-pattern, with a zone of rays below. At the back of the vase, beneath
                    the handle, is a broad palmette fan with tendrils ending in volutes. The foot is
                    set off by a raised fillet; rotelles are at the sides of the three-ribbed
                    handle. A molded female head is at the base of the handle on the neck and there
                    is a small spur for a thumb rest on the bottom of the handle. <hi rend="ital"

                    yellow-brown dilute glaze.</p>
                <p>This is an important vase, one of the earliest known examples of the
                    beaked oinochoe. The Washington University oinochoe is also "one of the most
                    attractive Corinthian vases..." of rare shape which "gives us valuable
                    information about the toreutic industry of this period" (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, p. 326, no. 1405</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Corinthian clay was originally matt buff and the application of a
                    red-orange slip here and on the late Corinthian pyxis from the same museum (see
                        <rs type="vase">St. Louis WU 3263</rs>) shows that the
                    Corinthian Tydeus Painter, and others like him during the second quarter of the
                    century, were imitating Athenian pottery and vying with it for popularity in the
                    export market. The red-ground was an attempt at duplication of the warm natural
                    red-orange of Athenian clay. The name of the Tydeus Painter comes from a
                    neck-amphora, <rs type="vase">Louvre E 640</rs> (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, no. 1437</bibl>) which depicts an enigmatic scene
                    of Tydeus killing Ismene, the former a hero of the Seven against Thebes, the
                    latter the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta. Despite this painter's attempts at
                    narrative on some vases, among the painters of the Corinthian red-ground style,
                    the Tydeus Painter's use of the figure is still decorative. The size and shape
                    of this very precious and delicate vase, plus the positioning of the mounted
                    youths here and on a similar oinochoe, <rs type="vase">London B
                    39</rs> (<bibl>Payne 1931, no. 1399</bibl>) show
                    this to be true. Although the work of contemporary Athenian decorators, that is,
                    members of the "E" Group, early Exekias, and even some of the work of the Amasis
                    Painter was coalescing into a confident, increasingly weighty vehicle for
                    story-telling, this colorful Corinthian style, nonetheless, forced a response
                    from some Athenian decorators, namely, the painters of the so-called
                    "Tyrrhenian" amphorae (see <rs type="vase">Omaha 1963.480</rs>).</p>
                <p>A look at the Chalcidian amphora from the University of Minnesota
                    (see <rs type="vase">Minneapolis WF 9</rs>) demonstrates the debt
                    which the artists from Chalcis (or from Chalcidian Italy) owed Corinth and, as
                    H. R. W. Smith conjectured, to the Tydeus Painter (<bibl
                       >H.R.W. Smith 1932, pp. 118-119</bibl>). The facing cocks,
                    paratactically arranged around a central floral motif, the Ionian lotus buds
                    encircling them from behind, were probably copied from Corinth. The
                    belly-amphora featured by Chalcidian potters was taken from Corinth before the
                    middle of the century (see <rs type="vase">Minneapolis WF 9</rs>,
                        <bibl>Rumpf 1927, 120</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Several features of decoration and shape, taken together, imply that
                    the Tydeus Painter and his potter had metal vases in mind as prototypes ‚Äî
                    metal vases of a new type, with ribbed handles, mouth, and foot cast and
                    attached to a "hammered" body (<bibl>Payne 1931, pp.
                        210 ff.</bibl>). The large palmette design painted in white at the base of
                    the handle is borrowed from metalwork where the motif, applied in relief, would
                    have masked the join of the handle to the vase (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, p. 213</bibl>). The tongue-pattern on the foot
                    and neck is a popular pattern on metal vases, as one sees on an oinochoe in the
                    Pomerance collection, c. 530 B.C. (<bibl>D. Mitten
                        and S. Doeringer, <title>Master Bronzes from the Classical
                            World</title> [Greenwich 1968] no. 77, p. 4, pl. 1</bibl>). The
                    rotelles, the applied head (<bibl>Payne 1931, no.
                        883, pl. 48.9</bibl>), and the shape of the mouth on the St. Louis oinochoe
                    can be compared to contemporary bronze oinochoe found at Corinth (<bibl
                       >Payne 1931, pl. 45 1,2,6.</bibl>). For
                    Corinthian bronze figures of horse and rider see <bibl
                       >F. Jones, <title>Ancient Art in The Art
                            Museum, Princeton University</title> (1960) 39</bibl>. The Terpaulos
                    Painter's red-figure oinochoe, lent by the same museum, shows the shape as it
                    was used slightly later in Athens (see <rs type="vase">St. Louis WU
                        3283</rs>). The style of the Tydeus Painter is similar to that of the
                    Andromeda Painter. The development of the Tydeus Painter's career, from more
                    narrative style to one which is increasingly decorative, has been discussed by
                        <bibl>Payne 1931, pp. 109-111</bibl>). This
                    oinochoe seems to be a late work of his.</p>

                    daub on haunches; centers and inner petals of lotusbuds, alternate petals of
                    palmette and red zigzag pattern on large palmette fan. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> women's faces, fillet in hair, ears; meander
                    and Antiparos pattern; white outline randomly on some tongues; two white lines
                    encircling vase beneath female heads; series of dots as inner markings for
                    animals and creatures. Outlines in dilute glaze for some tongues and for the
                    bottom scalloped edges of the tongue frieze.</p>
                <p>This painter was named by Professor J. L. Benson (<bibl
                       >Benson 1953, p. 54</bibl>) and the vase was discussed earlier
                    by Payne (<bibl>Payne 1931, p. 322</bibl>). Payne
                    said, "According to Furtw√§ngler covered with a red slip; the only vase of
                    this shape so treated. Heads of very definite style, not much earlier than 560
                    B.C. Schematic figures on the body, with much use of white." Benson wisely
                    separated this painter from the Tydeus Painter (see <rs type="vase"
                        >St. Louis WU 3267</rs>) and one can note the similarity of decorative
                    elements on this vase and on the beaked oinochoe from the same museum (<bibl
                       >Benson 1953, p. 54</bibl>). Professor Amyx has
                    added with certainty four more vases to this painter's work, all globular
                    oinochoe, three from the Louvre and one from T√ºbingen (<bibl
                       >Amyx 1988, p. 260</bibl>); the St. Louis pyxis is still the
                    only vase of its shape decorated by the painter. Four more vases are
                    "apparently" by the Lotus-Cross Painter, and another decorator, The Painter of
                    Louvre F 649, is seen as very close to his hand <hi rend="ital"
                        >(loc. cit.).</hi> Characteristic is the Lotus-Cross Painter's extensive use
                    of white, especially white dots in series; in Attica, somewhat contemporary with
                    him, are the Affecter (see <rs type="vase">Omaha 1953.255</rs>) and
                    the Painter of Berlin 1686 (see <rs type="vase">Chicago
                    1978.114</rs>) who, in similar fashion, also use white dots in series.</p>

                    62</bibl>) and Picozzi (<bibl>Picozzi 1971, p.
                    44</bibl>), without analysis, as "Swiss, Private Collection" and "Bellinzona,

                    and <bibl>Moore 1971, A69, 22</bibl> also published
                    the vase. It should be added to a group of three vases,<rs type="vase"
                       >Taranto 4349</rs>, <rs type="vase">Louvre CP
                    10622</rs>, and <rs type="vase">Athens Eph. G 1144</rs>, by Painter
                    H1. Birchall and Picozzi independently identified two of these vases (<rs
                        type="vase">Taranto 4349</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                        >Louvre CP 10622</rs>) as by a single hand. Birchall found them related in
                    style to the Painter of the Cabinet des M√©dailles horse-head (<bibl
                       >Birchall 1971, p. 52</bibl>). Picozzi (<bibl
                       >Picozzi 1971, p. 57</bibl>) at first put the
                    vases near her Painter B (Birchall's Painter of the Syracuse horse-head).
                    Subsequently Picozzi agreed with Birchall that the painter of the two vases
                    belonged near the painter of Cabinet des M√©dailles 204 (Birchall's
                    Painter of the Cabinet des M√©dailles horse-head), whom she named Painter
                    H (<bibl>Picozzi 1972, p. 383</bibl>). Picozzi added
                    the vase in Athens, Eph. G 1144 to <rs type="vase">Taranto
                    4349</rs> and <rs type="vase">Louvre CP 10622</rs>, and named the
                    painter of these three vases Painter H1 (<hi rend="ital">loc.
                    cit.</hi>). With the addition of the Indiana University horse-head neck-amphora,
                    four vases can be attributed to Painter H1, for whom a more descriptive name
                    will be suggested below.</p>
                <p>Painter H1 is an artist of interesting stylistic contrasts, on the
                    one hand displaying a careful, precise draftsmanship, especially in incision,
                    and on the other hand seeking monumentality and daring the unconventional. His
                    horses are large, or at least tall (<rs type="vase">Athens Eph. G
                        1144</rs>), and come to, or overlap the edge of a broad panel with
                    double-curved sides. The neck of the horse is strongly rounded, the head
                    slightly dropped. The eleven or twelve strands of the mane sweep down vertically
                    in reversed curves almost to the bottom of the protome. The two incised lines
                    marking each strand are carefully drawn in, parallel down to their ends, and are
                    exceptionally regular in shape and spacing. The strands are thus open at the
                    bottom, rather than being drawn to a point. The section of the mane in front of
                    the ear is formed by three incised lines (Indiana A and B; Taranto A and B)
                    which cut across the cheek-band. The ear is horizontal, narrow, neatly pointed
                    where the tip is clearly shown, and the concha may or may not be indicated even
                    on the same vase. The eye, placed vertically, is formed by two concentric
                    circles extended by opposed triangles. The ample nostril is placed near the edge
                    of the muzzle and is roughly triangular in shape. Except for the vase in Athens,
                    which has a chin-strap, the halter is simple, consisting of a cheek-strap and
                    noseband joined at obtuse angles by a neatly incised double ring.</p>
                <p>Two of the four amphorae attributed to Painter H1, the exhibited vase
                    and <rs type="vase">Athens Eph. G 1144</rs>, are unusual in their
                    decoration. Horse-head amphorae are commonly of type B; however, in addition to
                    the Indiana vase, four neck-amphorae (one fragmentary) are preserved. The three
                    complete examples have neither neck decoration nor base-rays, which are both
                    found on the Indiana University vase. It should be noted that panel
                    neck-amphorae of this period, other than horse-heads, often do have figural
                    decoration on the reserved neck and a frieze of base-rays. Another atypical
                    feature of the Indiana vase is the secondary image of a dolphin on each side of
                    the neck. With rare exceptions, dolphins occur in well-fixed contexts in Attic
                    black-figure painting. As decoration, they serve as fillers beneath handles; in
                    small groups, as on the tondo of the cup from Gordion in Berlin, <rs type="vase"
                       >Berlin Inv. 4604</rs>; or in elegant friezes, most notably on
                    Nikosthenic pottery. Possibly with a more specific emblematic significance they
                    appear commonly, singly or in pairs, as a shield device, painted white. As
                    attributes they are found in representations of Poseidon, Nereus, and Triton.
                    Brought into prominence as a single, monumental image, as in the exhibited vase,
                    the dolphin is highly unusual.</p>
                <p>Painter H1 also departs from common practice by adding forelegs to
                    the horse protome. The inclusion of forelegs on horse protomai was preferred by
                    Corinthian artists and appears frequently on aryballoi and alabastra of the late
                    seventh and early sixth century B.C. The forelegs on facing horse protomai
                    decorating the neck of a late seventh century B.C. amphora from Vari by the Lion
                    Painter (<rs type="vase">Athens, NM 16393</rs>) indicate that the
                    motif was transmitted to Attica. Lion, bull, panther, and Pegasus protomai with
                    forelegs all occur in Attic black-figure painting. Horse protomai with forelegs
                    are harder to find. Perhaps of particular relevance to the Indiana horse-head is
                    one of the rare examples: a neck-amphora from Vulci in Munich, (<rs type="vase"
                       >Munich 1483</rs>), which has shield devices with the same
                    motifs ‚Äî in one case a horse protome with forelegs and on a second
                    shield, two facing dolphins. Among the extant horse-head amphorae, only one, or
                    possibly two, both by Painter H1, have forelegs.</p>
                <p>The amphora in Athens, <rs type="vase">Athens Eph. G
                        1144</rs>, known to me only in photographs, might show on Side A (Side B is
                    missing and restored at that point) the same anomalous feature. A horizontal,
                    forked line emerges from the lower front of the protome and runs parallel to the
                    bottom edge of the panel. This line may be the trace of a hesitantly attempted,
                    repainted or poorly fired foreleg. If closer examination reveals this suggestion
                    to be indeed correct, Painter H1 could be renamed the Foreleg Painter. The
                    Athens vase is unconventional in another aspect. Unlike all other horse-head
                    amphorae of type B, the body panel is extended up to neck level where it is
                    decorated with a double palmette-lotus festoon. It is interesting that the
                    unusual features of the Indiana University and Athens vases, other than the
                    forelegs and the dolphins, are elements common in vases other than horse-heads.
                    It is likely that Painter H1 usually decorated other types of vases, and when
                    turning to the horse-head amphora carried over set habits of design. One could
                    also propose that he was an inventive experimenter attempting to free the
                    limited system of decoration of the traditional horse-head amphorae to respond
                    to the taste for greater decorativeness toward the middle of the sixth century
                    B.C. It is possible that the palmette-lotus motif of the Athens vase may permit
                    Painter H1 to be identified as an artist known from other vases where the same
                    motif appears.</p>
                <p>Large horse-head amphorae were primarily, but not exclusively, used
                    as funerary vases, serving as cinerary containers, tomb markers, and grave
                    goods. By the Archaic Period, the funerary and chthonian association of the
                    horse had long been entrenched in Greek culture. The sacrifice and entombment of
                    horses, as part of the funerary rite in some cases, and the frequent appearance
                    of horses on funerary vases of the Geometric period are but two reflections of
                    the strength of this association.</p>
                <p>The conjunction of dolphin and horse on the Indiana University
                    horse-head amphora is further support for an interpretation first suggested by
                    Malten <hi rend="ital">(infra</hi>) that on horse-head amphorae,
                    the horse signifies Poseidon. Creator and tamer of the horse, Poseidon was a
                    chthonian deity by virtue of his dwelling deep under the sea. Swirling against
                    and under the land, the sea had its energy-filled violence symbolized by the
                    horse, its beneficent aspects by the dolphin-both attributes of Poseidon. As
                    ravisher of Demeter in the guise of a horse, and in his assimilation into
                    Erechtheus, Poseidon shared her association with death and regeneration.
                    Poseidon was both <hi rend="ital">gaie-ochos</hi> (earth supporter)
                    and <hi rend="ital">enosichthon</hi> (earth shaker). In his horse
                    aspect he was worshipped with Athena <hi rend="ital">hippia,</hi>
                    at Kolonos in Attica, a cult transplanted from Corinth (Yalouris, <hi
                        rend="ital">infra,</hi> pp. 57 ff.). Yalouris has collected
                    ample evidence in vase painting, coinage, and small-scale dedications, of the
                    connection between Athena and Poseidon as elements in the myth of Bellerophon.
                    His suggestion <hi rend="ital">(ibid.,</hi> p. 54) that the bearded
                    male head which appears for example, on one side of a horse-head neck-amphora in
                    the Louvre (<rs type="vase">Louvre E 822</rs>), represents
                    Poseidon, is explicitly supported by the grand combination of horse and dolphin
                    on the Indiana vase.</p>
                <p>The horse-head amphorae all seem to have been produced during the
                    first half of the sixth century B.C. The Indiana horse-head neck-amphora is no
                    exception, having, on the one hand, a fully developed and assured composition
                    and draftsmanship, and on the other hand, the forelegs which relate it to the
                    earlier Corinthian tradition. On the basis of the anatomical structure of the
                    horse, Moore <hi rend="ital">(infra</hi>) has given a dating of
                    575-550 B.C. The shape of the vase has its closest parallels among vases dated
                    to the decade 560-550 B.C. An ovoid neck-amphora in Toledo, n. 74.45, painted
                    "in the Manner of Lydos," and an amphora in Heidelberg (<bibl
                       >CVA, Germany 10, Heidelberg 1, pl. 32, 1 and 2</bibl>)
                    attributed to Sakonides by Neutsch, Rumpf, and Beazley, are not far from the
                    Indiana vase. The origin of this vase was probably Etruria, as its modern
                    tenancy in Bellinzona would suggest. The production of neck-amphorae primarily
                    for export to Etruscan markets after c. 575 B.C. also supports a date well into
                    the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. for the Indiana neck-amphora.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 33.0 cm; D. 25.0 cm.
                    Complete. Paint flaked in various places. Black glaze extends inside neck; lower
                    body reserved. Thin red lines at outer edge of lip, around neck, bordering band
                    below panel, and on foot; red details on figures. Details incised, some holding
                    traces of lime incrustation but no added white. Upper border of panels: paired
                    ivy leaves, alternately red and black, joined to central vine stem; black dots
                    between leaves. Black rays in reserved area of lower body. The one-piece amphora
                    has a bulging body with short neck, wide collared-rim, round handles, and
                    echinus foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Both figure panels have
                    scenes of horsemen. On Side A a young rider leads a second horse (barely visible
                    behind the first) and is accompanied by two standing men. The rider carries a
                    long spear and is nude save for a red wreath on his short hair. The quietly
                    walking horse has a rather long body with a few careless incisions to suggest
                    muscular detail, and slender legs. Mane, tail, and a band on the rump are in
                    red. The harness shows a cheekstrap behind the pricked ears, divided at the
                    bottom for attachment to the bit, but no noseband. Facing the rider stands a
                    second nude youth, his right hand raised in greeting and the left holding a
                    spear. His long thin body shows the disproportionately heavy buttocks and thighs
                    common in early Greek art. He also wears a red wreath and has a large irregular
                    red blob covering his chest. Behind the horse stands an older man wearing a long
                    himation, its diagonal folds emphasized by red bands; he too holds a spear. He
                    is bearded and short-haired with a red fillet around his head.</p>
                <p>Side B shows two spear-bearing horsemen moving toward the right, both
                    men and horses very similar to the rider group on Side A. Here the horses' tails
                    are black, but manes and some body markings are in red. The youth in front, who
                    turns to face his companion, has red hair and a red circle around the nipple,
                    while the second rider's chest is covered with a red daub.</p>
                <p>Both sides show what appear to be inscriptions in the field, but they
                    are illegible, most of the "letters" being mere lines. Presumably an illiterate
                    painter imitated the inscriptions which better artists often used.</p>
                <p>While the standing men on Side A make a closed and fairly symmetrical
                    composition, that on Side B is open (although the turning pose of the first
                    youth connects him visually with his companion). While the draftsmanship is
                    reasonably good, it shows some irregularities, and in several instances the
                    application of paint does not follow the incised outline.</p>
                <p>The meaning of the scenes is uncertain. The similarity of subject may
                    imply that the two sides are to be considered parts of a single episode, but the
                    firmly closed composition of Side A makes this unlikely. The spears suggest a
                    military interpretation, but there is no other armament. Side A with the
                    greeting gesture of the standing youth and the attendant old man, resembles the
                    common returning-warrior theme, such as the return of the Dioskouroi on the
                    Exekias amphora in the Vatican. The pseudo-inscriptions placed near the figures
                    where one might expect names also suggests that the painter had a specific
                    return-event in mind, but there is no clue to aid in identification. In view of
                    the Greek fondness for horsemanship, it is equally possible that the subject
                    merely alludes to this well-known sport.</p>
                <p>The Krannert amphora belongs to the mature phase of Attic
                    black-figure and is influenced by the style of the Amasis Painter (see <rs
                        type="vase">Bloomington 71.82</rs>). In his early work, around
                    550, he is fond of this shape (panel amphora type B), and he favors simple
                    closed compositions without strong action. The long slender bodies and details
                    such as the sharp-nosed faces and the pointed calf seen in the standing youth of
                    Side A are common in the Amasis Painter's vases. However, these features are
                    also found in the work of several other black-figure painters around the middle
                    of the sixth century when the Amasis Painter was the most influential artist.
                    The Krannert vase lacks the neat craftsmanship, subtle spacing, and group
                    relationship which characterize the work of the master. Of the minor painters
                    clearly influenced by him, the Painter of Berlin 1686 shows the closest
                    analogies to the Krannert amphora in shape, composition, and numerous figure
                    details. The Amasis Painter's work is discussed by S. Karouzou in <bibl

                    >*P</foreign>.</p>
                <p>The subject on A is known from hundreds of Attic black-figured vases.
                    In the scheme here represented, the hero stands to right and has lifted the
                    forepart of the lion off the ground. Its right hind leg and foreleg are raised,
                    and its head is turned back (<bibl>Brommer 1973, pp.
                        126-127, Arc, nos. 1-29</bibl>). This is the standard scheme employed by the
                    painters of Group E and their contemporaries, and normally there are, in
                    addition to Herakles and the lion, two flanking figures, a woman and a man,
                    often nude. The man must be Iolaos, and the woman is frequently called Athena on
                    the analogy of those scenes (e.g., <bibl>Para., 56,
                        no. 42 bis</bibl>) in which she wears a helmet and carries a spear. On this
                    amphora, however, there are five figures (not counting the lion). The nude man
                    holding a spear on the extreme left may be Iolaos and his counterpart on the
                    extreme right is clearly marked as Hermes by his petasos, the boots, and the
                    caduceus. Athena faces Herakles and is fully armed with an Attic helmet, a round
                    shield emblazoned with a cock, and a spear. But who, in this case, is the woman
                    behind Herakles who extends both hands? She can only be Nemea, daughter of
                    Asopos, granddaughter of Okeanos, and sister of Aegina.</p>
                <p>The battle scene on the reverse is equally crowded. Two pairs of
                    hoplites face each other in a battle over a fallen warrior. The devices are four
                    bent, conjoined legs and a star. A diminutive man holding a spear is added on
                    the right, almost as a space-filler.</p>
                <p>This amphora can be attributed to the Painter of Berlin 1686, one of
                    the painters whom Beazley recognized almost fifty years ago (<bibl
                       >CVA, GB 9, Oxford 2, p. 98</bibl>). From a nucleus of four
                    vases established in 1931, the list grew to eleven in 1934 (<bibl
                       >BSA, 32 [1934] 10-11</bibl>), almost doubled to twenty in
                    1956 (<bibl>ABV, 296-297; 692</bibl>) and counted 27
                    at the time of Beazley's death in 1970. In addition to <rs type="vase"
                       >Chicago 1978.114</rs>, at least six other amphorae of type B
                    can be added to the known attributions, notably one in Orvieto: the three
                    kithara players on the reverse are very close to <bibl
                       >ABV, 296, no. 4</bibl>, and Herakles with Zeus and Athena in

                    <hi rend="ital">ter</hi> (identical with <bibl
                       >Brommer 1973, 64, no. 14</bibl>). Even closer to the amphora
                    in Chicago is <rs type="vase">St. Petersburg 1470 (St. 31)</rs>
                    which is unpublished.</p>
                <p>An unusual feature of the Chicago amphora is the lateral frame
                    composed of chevrons. The pattern is rather rare in Attic black-figure. It first
                    occurs on the sides of panels on an amphora of type B in Halle (<bibl
                       ><title>Wissenschaftliche

                    panels on another amphora B once in the Basel market (<bibl
                       >M√ºnzen, vol. 26 [October 5, 1963] pl. 27, no.
                    88</bibl>). For a late survival of the pattern, compare a black-figured oinochoe
                    (shape 1) put by Beazley near the Altenburg Class (<bibl
                       >Para., 182</bibl>; <bibl>Cat.

                <p>The amphora once in the Basel market was attributed by Cahn to the
                    Circle of Early Lydos, but Beazley did not cite it in Paralipomena. There are
                    enough resemblances to the amphora in Chicago to consider whether the Basel
                    amphora may not also count as an early work of the Painter of Berlin 1686.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> warrior leaving home. A warrior with
                    long hair, wearing only helmet and greaves and carrying a large shield on his
                    left arm, a spear in the opposite hand, appears to be departing. Two small
                    children (represented as small adults) are at his feet; one seems to be tugging
                    at the shield, the other gestures with his left hand. The warrior is accompanied
                    by six other figures, which brings the total to nine, including children. An
                    elderly man, with curly hair and beard, stands directly before the warrior and
                    behind this man are two others, also bearded, the first in a chlamys, the second
                    wrapped in a banded himation. Behind the warrior is a woman, perhaps his wife,
                    who wears a solid-colored peplos and a shawl with star-patterns. She has a
                    necklace. She has her back to a nude kouros and, further along, to an elderly
                    fellow in a striped himation. There are meaningless inscriptions in the field
                    and festoons of lotus and palmettes above the scene. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red:</hi> helmet, greaves, inside of shield, bands on
                    mantle and himatia, woman's peplos; hairdos of both youth and bearded man on
                    extreme left, hair of child in front of warrior; fillets; cuffs of lotus
                    blossoms and hearts of palmette fans. <hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi>
                    assemblage of warriors and gods(?). In the center a bearded man, facing right,
                    wears a himation which is banded horizontally - not diagonally as one sees
                    elsewhere on the vase; this might be a god. On either side are two groups, each
                    with three figures. In the forward group a youthful, clean-shaven Hermes, his
                    long hair bound in a pug with side locks, faces and, possibly along with the
                    central figures, addresses a tall warrior and another bearded gentleman dressed
                    in a himation. Hermes wears chiton and chlamys, petasos and winged boots and
                    carries in his right hand the kerykeion. The warrior has a highcrested
                    Corinthian-type helmet, a shield without emblem, and greaves; the optimate
                    behind, seemingly middle-aged, has a short beard and shorter hair than the rest.
                    The other group of three, except for its warrior, has older men, one an elder
                    Hermes, the other a noticeably balding man in a fancy himation - with broad
                    stripes, border of meander around the neck, and "x" patterns at the shoulder and
                    near the foot. This Hermes sports a banded and fringed mantle, has winged boots,
                    traveling hat and kerykeion or staff. Without a sleeve on the garment, the
                    double incised lines around his neck, unless they represent jewelry, have little
                    meaning. Hermes strides to the left, the old man too and, apparently with open
                    mouths, they speak to the warrior who approaches and faces them. The warrior's
                    long hair spills from under his low-crested Corinthian-type helmet. We see the
                    inner side of his shield (complete with hand-grip and tassels), the spear and
                    greaves. Florals similar to Side A. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi>
                    both Hermes' winged boots; the brim of the youthful god's hat; the crown of the
                    hat, hair and beard of the elder Hermes; bands on himatia and mantles; warriors'
                    helmets and their plumage or crests; insides of one shield and central area on
                    the exterior of the other; greaves; hair and beards of gentlemen; cuffs of
                    lotuses and hearts of palmette fans. Two closely spaced red bands run around the
                    vase under the picture panels and another is above the zone of rays. Zone of
                    rays above foot. Meaningless inscriptions in the field. Graffito and dipinto
                    similar to those on the amphora type B by the same painter at The Art Institute
                    of Chicago (see <rs type="vase">Chicago 1978.114</rs>).</p>
                <p>This amphora and its companion at The Art Institute of Chicago are
                    attributed by Dietrich von Bothmer. One thinks of them as a pair because of the
                    nearly identical measurements vase to vase, because of the comparable amount of
                    glazing inside the neck, and especially because of the similar red-brown dipinto
                    under the foot. There are differences: the added red color on both sides of this
                    vase is purple, while on the Chicago amphora the color is rust or red-brown. The
                    painter uses no added white here but employs it extensively on the other. On
                    this vase no red circles are found around the nipples on the males' chests; the
                    woman's face, hands, and feet are drawn in outline and not, as expected,
                    indicated in paint. Chevron patterns frame the panels on the Chicago amphora;
                    two vertical lines in dilute glaze suffice here. The painter takes his name from
                    an amphora of similar type and date in Berlin (<bibl
                        >ABV, 296, no. 4</bibl>). On the obverse a procession of three youths,
                    headed by a priestess carrying three olive branches in each hand, leads a cow to
                    be sacrificed before a statue of Athena Polias (this is the same statue which
                    seems to be represented on the black-figure eye-cup lent to this exhibition by
                    Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Frank: see <bibl>Moon 1979,
                        no. 59</bibl>). The youth in the center of the three on Side A of the Berlin
                    amphora compares favorably in details of the face and hair to the nude youth
                    behind the woman on Side A of this vase in Madison; the warrior in the center of
                    this scene has the same rather oddly designed chest.</p>
                <p>The painter's scenes are as dense with figures as they are elaborate
                    and careful with detail. Even in traditional stories he adds figures ‚Äî
                    Nemea to the story of Herakles and the Lion (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Chicago 1978.114</rs>). Beazley himself might have commented that the
                    painter makes a longer story out of a shorter one; I know of no wedding
                    procession in the panel of a black-figure amphora that has a larger cast than
                    the nuptial of Zeus and Hera on the painter's vase (<rs type="vase"
                        >London B 197</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 296, no.
                    1</bibl>). Besides the special pair in a quadriga, the count is six attendant
                    gods and a small Siren. As this pair of amphorae readily demonstrates, the
                    Painter of Berlin 1686 wants always to impress: either with archaeological
                    details ‚Äî the specifics of the interior of shields, ornamental curls on
                    helmets, tops of arrows arranged in the quiver, fringes and borders of garments
                    ‚Äî or with the depiction of different ages of personages; with that sheer
                    welter of participants, or with copious inscriptions which, by their presence
                    alone, conjure up an heroic air.</p>
                <p>Both sides of the Madison amphora bear inscriptions, some lengthy,
                    all meaningless and compounds of the same formula, EOS (for other vases by the
                    painter with similar inscriptions: <bibl>J. D.
                        Beazley, "Some Inscriptions on Vases: 11," <title
                        >AJA</title> 33 [1929] 361-362</bibl>) Was the painter illiterate? Would
                    that the inscriptions on the Madison amphora could provide a clue to what
                    otherwise are confounding and, in the case of the double Hermes on Side B,
                    unique depictions. This is another point of contrast in the pair of amphorae:
                    the Chicago amphora has somewhat typical scenes and no inscriptions. The
                    juxtaposition of a youthful and bearded Hermes in the same scene is
                    unprecedented in black-figure vase-painting or, for that matter, in the sixth
                    century. Could the youthful fellow be a different god?</p>
                <p>Perseus stole winged boots and the traveling hat from the three
                    Graiai (<bibl n="Apollod. 2.4.2">Apollod.
                    2.4.2-3</bibl>) ‚Äî oddly enough at Hermes' own suggestion. As liberator of
                    sorts, Perseus carries a weapon, mostly the harpe or scimitar and at times a
                    sword. "As Hermes is closely connected with Perseus as his helper and protector,
                    he sometimes appears next to the latter on the same vase, distinguished from him
                    only by the Kerykeion" (<bibl>T. H. Price, "'To be
                        or not to be' on an Attic Black-Figure Pelike," <title
                        >AJA</title> 75 [1971] 433, with examples</bibl>). If the Painter of Berlin
                    1686 appears illiterate, as we think, he could well have made the simple mistake
                    of giving the youthful figure, Perseus, the staff instead of the sickle or
                    sword. Our investigation could end at this point.</p>
                <p>But that this vase-decorator intended two depictions of Hermes, one
                    young, one older, is still a viable possibility. A late red-figured calyx-krater
                    in Athens (<rs type="vase">Athens, NM 1669</rs>) was interpreted
                    recently as showing two Herms on one base: "one youthful with long hair, the
                    other bearded" (<bibl>T. H. Price, "Double and
                        Multiple Representations in Greek Art and Religious Thought," <title
                           >JHS</title> (1971) 58</bibl>. This pair of Herms had
                    previously been interpreted as Aphrodite and Hermes but the youthful member with
                    long hair seems definitely female (<bibl>Metzger
                        1965, 83 and 90, pl. 31.2</bibl>). In very early Greek times, in the world
                    of Homer, the god does seem to have been thought of as young and beautiful
                        (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.347">Hom. Il.
                    24.347</bibl>). The messenger god had many other natures or aspects, appealing
                    in one perhaps to the young, in another to those older. In Athens he was held as
                    Hegemonios, which, as the name implies, was leader of the men to war, and the
                        <hi rend="ital">strategoi</hi> sacrificed to him under this
                    title (<bibl>Farnell 1977, 22</bibl>). In many parts
                    of Greece he was worshipped with reference to athletics and the palaestra (<bibl
                       >Farnell 1977, p. 29</bibl>). Most of all, with
                    the contrasting epithets of Hermes Chthonios and Epichthonios one could
                    visualize an older and a younger aspect of the same deity (<bibl
                       >J. Orgogoza, "L'Herm√®s des Ach√©ens," <title
                           >Revue de l'Histoire des Religions</title> 136 [1949] 146
                        and 164</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Although the painter has taken some pains to distinguish the ages of
                    his figures on Side B of the Madison amphora, to grant the Painter of Berlin
                    1686 the sophisticated power of religious synthesis might be a real extension of
                    his abilities. This double depiction ‚Äî of Hermes at least as the
                    attributes given us seem to suggest ‚Äî is probably nothing more than
                    artistic tour de force. As he contrasted so many other aspects on this pair of
                    amphorae, so too for novelty's sake, we have two Hermes. Side A of this vase,
                    "warrior leaving home," attended by two children, seems to be generic. The
                    children are probably space-fillers like the little man on the far right of Side
                    B of the Chicago amphora (see <rs type="vase">Chicago

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase and Lid:</hi> H. 36.3 cm (with
                    lid); H. 31.5 cm; D. of foot 12.2 cm; max. D. 21.5 cm; D. of neck 14.2 cm; D. of
                    lid 14.0 cm. Reconstituted from a number of large fragments, minor areas
                    restored in plaster, chafing and surface abrasion, which has been restored and
                    blackened. The vase is published and photographed cleaned (von Bothmer, <hi
                        rend="ital">infra,</hi> pl. 11.1 and 2) but as it is now, it
                    has the following minor details of cosmetic. On Side A, restored attachment of
                    right handle, most of second lotus from left, Dionysos' cloak at right thigh
                    from groin to knee and towards dog's nose, tip of left youth's foot and round
                    area below it; some broad cracks on the lower vase-body have in-painting. On
                    Side B, restored right lotus, fragments of vase-body in front of lower handle
                    attachment, piece in upper thigh of youth who greets Dionysos, and filling of
                    cracks and rips as on Side A. There is a small triangular patch in the lower
                    portion of the vase-body to the right of the picture panel. The lid is repaired
                    at one side in the plaster.</p>
                <p>The top of the lip is glazed and the interior of the neck is glazed
                    at the top in a broad band; there is a broad band of added red at the inner edge
                    of the lip. Broad echinus foot, regular ovoid body, shoulder joining fluidly
                    into a broad neck. Rim set off, projecting sharply outwards, the carination
                    slightly undercut. Fine ridge on the outer edge of lip; handles steeply rising,
                    curving sharply towards lower part of neck, round in section. The lid has an
                    off-set outer rim, low and dome-shaped, with a pomegranate knob; below, a
                    vertical lip to fit inside amphora neck; interior of dome evenly curved;
                    interior pomegranate partially hollowed, hole pierced from within.<note

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Side A and B are rather
                    similar. On Side A, Dionysos stands in the center, facing right, a drinking horn
                    in his left hand. The god is greeted by a man who wears a felt cap and chlamys,
                    followed by a youth dressed in a himation. Two more youths, both in short
                    mantles, stand behind Dionysos. His entourage carry spears and they are
                    accompanied by two dogs which rear slightly, with front legs raised. Side B is
                    similar but has Dionysos attended by four youths, each wearing mantles. The dogs
                    snarl but less violently, with their feet on the ground. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red</hi> (largely the same on both sides): backs, necks,
                    stripes on dogs; fillets, circles around nipples and mantles on youth; on Side
                    A, felt cap on bearded fellow, details on himation of youth behind, and
                    Dionysos' hair in back; there are two red lines under picture panel, one as a
                    groundline for the scene; a red band to mark the junction of the foot to the
                    body of the vase. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi> Dionysos'

                    palmettes and lotuses; Side A has additional "half unit" at each end; Side B
                    does not have this feature. The hearts of the palmette are red and the three
                    spiked petals of the lotus flowers are also red. The short base line for the
                    palmette is red. Aspects of the florals are important considerations for the
                    chronology of the works of the Amasis Painter (<bibl

                    20.3 cm; W. 34.4 cm. Complete; mended from a few large fragments; glaze damage
                    on handle B/A and to the foot on same side; minor surface abrasion elsewhere.
                    Standard mid-sixth-century type with flaring mouth, round handles, and inverted
                    echinus foot. Above panel on Side A, lotus-palmette frieze; on Side B,
                    simplified lotus-palmette frieze in which the lotuses preserve a semi-bud form
                    with a smooth, rounded base. Dilute-glaze lines at sides and bottom of panels.
                    At base, rays. Three bands in added red on neck, two just below panels, two
                    above rays, and one on foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Herakles and Busiris. Herakles,
                    dressed in a short chiton and the skin of the Nemean Lion, with a quiver hanging
                    at his waist, strides to the right, holding one Egyptian priest upside-down by
                    the ankle and grasping another by the neck. Before him the Egyptian king
                    Busiris, already slain, lies slumped over an altar, apparently made of bricks
                    and decorated with rosettes. Three other Egyptians flee at right and left,
                    looking back in alarm. Between the legs of the one at left, there is a small
                    stool. In the field, at upper right, a nonsense inscription. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B:</hi> youth setting out between two draped men and two
                    warriors. The warrior at left wears a fawn-skin <hi rend="ital"
                        >(nebris)</hi> over his chiton and is armed with a helmet, greaves, and a
                    shield; the one at right has only a shield. The youth in the center wears
                    crossed baldrics for a quiver or sword, but neither piece of equipment is
                    visible. As Cedric Boulter has suggested (<bibl
                        >Boulter 1966, p. 6</bibl>), this scene may represent warriors arming.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> A, calyxes of lotuses;
                    hair, beards, and stripes in garments of some Egyptians; fillet of elderly
                    Egyptian at right; chiton and quiver of Herakles; cores of rosettes on altar. B,
                    central leaves on palmettes; hair of youth and that of warrior at right; stripes
                    in mantles and in chiton skirt of youth; chiton, fillet, and greaves of warrior

                    skin; robes of two Egyptians; hair, necklace, and knife-handle of another;
                    various small dots on altar and clothing. B, blazons on shields; base of
                    helmet-crest and spots on <hi rend="ital">nebris</hi> of warrior at
                    left; crossed baldrics of youth; dot-rosettes on clothing.</p>
                <p>The Cincinnati amphora is a true masterpiece of the Attic
                    black-figure technique; in addition, the main scene on this vase is one of the
                    earliest depictions of the rather uncommon theme of Herakles and Busiris. Thus
                    it seems essential that we discuss the vase in the catalogue even though its
                    condition has prevented its inclusion in the exhibition.</p>
                <p>The myth of Herakles and Busiris, which takes place in Egypt, appears
                    in Greece first in vase-painting (mid-sixth century B.C.), then (about a century
                    later) in literature, with Herodotus (<bibl n="Hdt. 11.45"
                       >Hdt. 11.45</bibl>), who thought the tale impious and foolish.
                    But his kinsman and contemporary, Panyassis, the epic poet, is quoted by
                    Seleukos the grammarian as having described "human sacrifice in Egypt" (F 26
                    Kinkel). There is something brilliantly comical about the Swing Painter's
                    conception, about his vengeful, hulking Herakles, who by sheer brute force,
                    wielding an Egyptian as a human club, manages to worst the entire company,
                    including the pharaoh, Busiris. E. H. Gombrich has written of this
                    representation, "There is little doubt that this humorous account of Herakles'
                    exploits among the Egyptians was inspired by Egyptian renderings of some
                    victorious campaign ... (one of) the many pictorial chronicles that shows a
                    gigantic figure of Pharaoh confronting an enemy stronghold with its pygmy
                    defenders begging for mercy, which the Greeks had seen" (<bibl
                       >Gombrich 1961, 135</bibl>). At some point Greek mythographers
                    interpreted the Egyptian topos as a familiar idiom, making this adventure an
                    early part (like the battle against Antaios) of Herakles' last labor, "the quest
                    for the Golden Apples of the Hesperides."</p>
                <p>Egypt has been plagued by drought, and its pharaoh Busiris, desperate
                    for a solution, consults a seer, Phrasios of Cyprus, who tells him that the
                    first stranger in his land should be sacrificed to Zeus. The remedy may have
                    been effective, but the cure proved worse than the disease. With little interest
                    in tourism, Busiris, in order to insure continued protection from the gods,
                    victimizes every foreigner who journeys to Egypt. Herakles the eternal, now the
                    international defender, could not tolerate such inhospitable behavior; the
                    rights and safety of travelers were sacred to Zeus Paraxenos. The hero feigns
                    surrender to the Egyptians and relinquishes his accustomed weapons, the club and
                    bow. Just as he is about to be sacrificed, Herakles turns the tables and at
                    least in the Swing Painter's representation, has the pharaoh sacrificed on the
                    altar in his stead.</p>
                <p>As Boulter has pointed out (<bibl>Boulter
                        1966, p. 3</bibl>), the Swing Painter was wise to choose a one-piece amphora
                    for such a vigorous, action-packed scene. Traditionally, this type of amphora
                    has separate, framed picture-zones and is largely black, the dark-ground forming
                    a contrast to the light-red panels. These features, as well as the unity of the
                    form of the vase ‚Äî the neck and body are made together in one motion of
                    the potter's hands ‚Äî provide not only scale but increased dramatic power.
                    By comparison, a black-figure neck amphora, (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 56</bibl>), where the neck is made separately
                    from the body and the surface of the vase is primarily red, does not usually
                    work to the same narrative advantage. The black figures on a neck-amphora appear
                    thinner, less substantial, and more ornamental simply because they are not the
                    same color as the field and because the picture-zone is not framed. It took
                    Exekias to break the limitations of the neck-amphora in terms of narrative power
                    in his famous example in the British Museum, London B210, which shows Achilles
                    killing the Amazon queen Penthesilea (<bibl>ABV,
                        144, no. 7</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Swing Painter seems to have preferred to decorate amphorae of
                    type B, although his hand is evident on a large number of neck-amphorae. His
                    name-vase in Boston, which shows a girl seated on a swing, is a type B amphora
                        (<bibl>ABV, 306, no. 41</bibl>). "This is a
                    large and comical group," wrote Beazley of the Swing Painter. "Those who tire of
                    the symmetry, sobriety, and normality of Group E," he added, "will like the
                    looser composition of the Swinger, his haphazard anatomy, quaint touches, and
                    unusual subjects" (<bibl><title
                        >BSA</title> 32 [1931-32] 12</bibl>). Though the painter has given his
                    Egyptians uncommon details of physiognomy, such as high foreheads, curly hair,
                    and white eyebrows, he has not made their features negroid, like those of the
                    priests in a version of the myth on a pelike in Athens by the Pan Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 554, no. 82</bibl>). The composition of
                    the Swing Painter's scene of Herakles and Busiris may, at first glance, seem
                    informal, but it is strictly organized, having a central focus with
                    design-elements paired antiphonally around this axis. For example, the outermost
                    figures with daggers adopt the same pose: they run away but look back. On either
                    side of the king and hero, there is a priest, each with a seemingly weightless
                    body, each wearing a white tunic of similar length. In terms of anatomy, the
                    painter may have rendered the calf of Herakles' right leg somewhat awkwardly,
                    but, nonetheless, he has given the hero a most convincing death-grip on one
                    Egyptian's neck.</p>
                <p>For his representation of the Busiris myth, the Swing Painter appears
                    to have borrowed and adapted some essential elements from the traditional
                    iconography employed by Attic vase-painters to depict the death of Priam.
                    Black-figure artists normally portray Priam, the elderly king of Troy, stretched
                    out over an altar, either already slain or begging for mercy from his assailant,
                    Achilles' vengeful son, Neoptolemos. The two versions of the scene are
                    exemplified, respectively, on an amphora of type B in Bonn by the Princeton
                    Painter, the Swing Painter's master (<bibl>ABV, 299,
                        no. 1</bibl>), and on a neck-amphora in the Louvre by a contemporary of the
                    Swing Painter, the Bucci Painter (<rs type="vase">Louvre F

                        4</bibl>). On the amphora in Cincinnati, the pharaoh Busiris lies slain upon
                    an altar in much the same manner as King Priam on the Bonn amphora. Many
                    black-figure representations of the story of Priam, moreover, show Neoptolemos
                    wielding the body of Astyanax, Hektor's young son and Priam's grandson, as a
                    weapon. This gruesome touch, which is not part of the literary account of the
                    legend, comes from the narrative of the death of Astyanax by Lesches (<bibl
                        n="The Little Iliad, Par. 14">The Little Iliad,
                        Par. 14</bibl>), according to which Neoptolemos seized the child by his foot
                    and hurled him from the walls of Troy. A vivid portrayal of Neoptolemos
                    threatening King Priam with the body of Astyanax appears on the Bucci Painter's
                    neck-amphora in the Louvre. Very much the same motif is employed by the Swing
                    Painter to portray Herakles on the Cincinnati amphora. Having already dispatched
                    Busiris, the hero has grasped one of his victim's priests by the ankle and
                    prepares to use him as a club against another, whom he has seized by the throat.
                    This particular treatment of the myth seems to be unique to the Swing Painter.
                    Two similar depictions do exist, one on a Caeretan hydria in Vienna, dated ca.
                    530 B.C., the other on the pelike in Athens, of ca. 470, by the Pan Painter (<hi
                        rend="ital">supra</hi>). On both of these vases, Herakles is
                    using an Egyptian as a human club, but Busiris is not present.</p>

                    preserving front panel, shoulder above and small section of the neck. Broken and

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Panel:</hi> In the center a warrior striding to
                    right, spear in right hand, shield in left, armed with sword, greaves and
                    helmet. He wears a short chiton and over it an animal skin. On his left is a
                    bearded man wearing a long chiton and cloak, and holding a spear, upright, in
                    his left hand. On the right of the warrior is a woman, facing left, dressed in
                    peplos and himation. The panel bordered below by a ground line, on the left and
                    right by a double row of ivy leaves, alternately red and black, set between two
                    thin black lines; thin black glaze line at the junction of the shoulder and
                    body. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> for fillet and cloak of man
                    on left, for greaves, helmet (excluding crest), shield (excluding rim) and
                    tassels of warrior's shield, and for central dot of rosettes on his chiton and
                    on woman's cloak. <hi rend="ital">Added white</hi> (now faded): for
                    arms and face of woman, and outer dots of rosettes on her cloak and on warrior's
                    chiton. Possibly patches of white on warrior's animal skin. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Shoulder:</hi> lion on left with head turned back to the left;
                    in the center, a Siren with face partly missing; on the right, four feet of
                    another animal, perhaps also a lion. <hi rend="ital">Added
                    red:</hi> lion's mane and Siren's wing. Siren's face was once white but now is
                    completely faded. Above, a frieze of tongues, alternately black and red.
                    Inscriptions (<hi rend="ital">infra</hi>).</p>
                <p>Beneath the hoplite is an inscription which translates "defender of
                    the gates," if it can be reconstructed <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                        >*A*I*N*I*P*U*L&lt;*O*R&gt;*O*S</foreign>, "Ainipyl(or)os". However, the
                    form of the lambda is rare in Attic script (<bibl
                        >Jeffery 1961, 66</bibl>). If it is taken, instead, as a gamma, one might
                    translate the inscription, old "dread bottom." Another inscription seems to
                    spill from the woman's mouth, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*D*O*R*O*I</foreign> (the vocative of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                        >*D*O*R*O</foreign>) and this seems to be the woman's name, meaning "giver"
                    or "gift." The scene appears to be one of a warrior leaving home for battle.
                    Hydriai of this date characteristically have the panel heavily outlined, often
                    with ivy leaves at the sides, framed on the shoulder by an animal frieze
                    (compare <rs type="vase">Omaha 1953.255</rs>). The rounded body and
                    sloping shoulders are appropriate to the date; later, in the next decade, the
                    hydria will have a shoulder increasingly more sharply set off from the body. The
                    round shoulder may show something of earlier Corinthian prototypes for the shape
                        (<bibl>Diehl 1964, 58</bibl>); the woman retains
                    aspects of the Corinthian "penguin" women, and the animals on the shoulder were
                    inherited from Corinth as well. Dr. Karl Deppert has attributed this fragment to
                    the painter of a black-figure hydria in the Collection Ludwig, Aachen (<bibl

                    D. of mouth 10.4 cm; D. of base 6.79 cm. Minor chips around mouth; polished
                    areas ‚Äîmdash; one to the right of the first figure's face, another to the

                    Two small concentric black circles on underside of vase. Graffito incised from
                    the neck to the waist of the fourth figure: Gamma, Rho, unsuccessful Alpha,
                    successful Alpha, Phi, Iota, Sigma. Perhaps this is an attempt at the word <hi

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Athletes and Trainers:
                    three men wrapped in long cloaks are separated by two nude athletes: I. a
                    trainer, wearing the himation, faces right, and his head leans forward; 2. a
                    nude youth, legs in profile facing left, has a body which twists sharply at the
                    waist ‚Äîmdash; his right arm is bent at the elbow, "elbows-out," and his
                    left arm is raised high; 3. this figure is very similar to 1; 4. a nude youth
                    with short hair and receding chin, chest frontal, strides to the right in a
                    mannered pose, similar to that of the other naked youth; 5. a draped figure with
                    prominent chin, faces left. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> hair
                    and cloaks of 1, 3 and 5.</p>
                <p>The vase surface is dominated by simple figures which emphasize the
                    vertical format of the shape and, by arrangement and with gestures, invite the
                    drinker to handle and turn the vase, better to savor its contents. It is quite
                    surprising that this shape, which fits so well in the drinker's hands, should be
                    so very rare in the archaeological record of ancient Greece. Only five
                    black-figure and eight red-figure examples are thus far known; another
                    black-figure kalathos is in the Midwest at The Toledo Museum of Art (<rs
                        type="vase">Toledo 1967.134</rs>: <bibl
                       >CVA, USA 17, Toledo 1, pl. 33</bibl>). Such a beaker has
                    conventionally been called kalathos which, if taken literally, according to
                    ancient sources, means a wicker basket in the shape of a lily. Such baskets were
                    usually five or ten times larger than this beaker and were for flowers, fruit or
                    wool. The mannered gestures of the figures recall the "Elbows Out Painter" and
                    the "Affecter" (see <rs type="vase">Omaha 1953.255</rs>) and there
                    are some affinities in figure style to the work of the Amasis Painter (see <rs
                        type="vase">Bloomington 71.82</rs>). These comparisons may
                    prove only generally helpful in determining date. All the black-figure kalathoi
                    were probably made in the same workshop and, perhaps, even by the same painter.
                    Certainly this vase was decorated by the same hand as the kalathos in the
                    collection of Dietrich von Bothmer. This attribution is made by Betty Grossman.
                    The incisions on the figures are so summary that it is difficult to pinpoint the
                    decorator or workshop more specifically.</p>

                    shield and Corinthian helmet. A corner of the sail and yardarm are preserved; at
                    the end of the yard are incisions for the beginning of braces (the ropes that
                    set the yard to the wind), and other incisions mark the ropes lashing the sail
                    to the yard. <hi rend="ital">Applied white</hi> originally used on

                <p>This fragment of an Attic dinos (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 71.46</rs>) is remarkable for several reasons although the small
                    amount preserved makes detailed discussion impossible. The chariot scene is
                    unusual in having inscriptions painted beside the figures and in the choice of
                    subject. While miniature scenes are common enough on the tops of dinos rims, no
                    others known to me are inscribed and no others have chariots actually going into
                    battle. The Fran√ßois Vase preserves the only other miniature Diomedes in
                    a chariot; there he is racing his own vehicle in the funeral games for
                    Patroklos. He appears twice in a frontal chariot on larger vessels, a
                    tripod-pyxis in Athens and a hydria in Vienna. On the Chicago fragment he is
                    riding into battle, armed, in epic fashion, with two spears, and his chariot's
                    horses overlap a standing warrior of whom only a bent arm survives; another
                    quadriga follows Diomedes closely. The freedom with which vase painters treated
                    their epic sources makes reference to actual events in the Iliad risky, but one
                    is reminded of the opening of Book Six where Diomedes slays a number of Trojans
                    from his chariot. One of these is a charioteer, Kalesios, whose name may have
                    been transferred by the painter to Diomedes' own driver above whose head appear
                    the letters <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L</foreign>..., if
                    indeed the name does not refer to the figures following. The other fragmentary
                    inscription/at the bottom (...<foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*I*F*O*S</foreign>) may identify the following warrior: on the Fran√ßois
                    Vase the hero Damasippos follows Diomedes; if aspiration of the "p" occurred, he
                    might become the (Damas)iphos of our scene. As far as names go, there are no
                    other likely candidates amongst either Greeks or Trojans. It is possible,
                    although much less likely, that the names may refer to painter, potter or
                    "kalos" figure.</p>
                <p>The ship on the interior is one of the most neatly drawn of its type;
                    the conceit of a tiny fleet sailing over a wine-dark sea evidently appealed to
                    painters in the second half of the sixth century and a number of kraters, dinoi
                    and cups with such decoration are known. Many of these can be seen in <bibl
                       >Morrison &amp; Williams 1968, pl.
                    13-18</bibl>, a fundamental though incomplete source of information, and in
                        <bibl>Schauenburg 1970, pls. 12-14</bibl>.
                    Others are known, including one in Cleveland (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 71.46</rs>) and an unpublished fragment from a calyx krater in
                    Corinth. The earliest example may be one in Boston that Schauenburg dates to
                    about 540 B.C., although the rigging with halyards flanking the mast is a type
                    only found much later on other vases (The Boston vase was recently published and
                    dated later in <bibl>CVA, USA 19, Boston 2, pp.
                    9-10</bibl>). The scenes are always warships under sail and oar; often the
                    artist misjudged the space available and was forced to omit the upper parts of
                    mast and sail, although there seems to be space for them on the Chicago
                    fragment. Details of rigging are generally included, as are details of hull
                    structure; rarely does an artist make so elementary a mistake as drawing the
                    cathead stanchion backwards, as he has done here. Rare also is the neatly drawn
                    warrior in the prow; normally the <hi rend="ital">proreus,</hi> or
                    lookout, is unarmed. Another unusual feature is the checkerboard decoration of
                    the bow screen; usually the decoration is lozenge-shaped. On the famous cup by
                    Exekias in Munich, with Dionysos on the pirate ship, there appears a
                    checkerboard screen; the ships on the Villa Giulia dinos by Exekias have,
                    however, the more conventional lozenges (see <bibl

                <p>Johnson tentatively suggested that the piece might be by Exekias but
                    Beazley apparently did not follow him in this attribution and indeed omitted the

                    E, which was responsible for a number of similar ship scenes.</p>

                <p>This vase, another very much like it in Cleveland (illustrated and
                    briefly discussed: <bibl>Arias &amp; Hirmer
                        1962, pl. xiii and p. 294</bibl>), and a white-ground sub-type amphora at
                    Oberlin College (see <rs type="vase">Oberlin 70.11</rs>) are fine
                    examples of this curious type. Beazley attributed this vase to Painter "N"
                        (<bibl>ABV, 219, no. 23</bibl>) and, indeed, the
                    decoration on the one hundred or more preserved amphorae may be largely this
                    painter's work. "Thiasos Group" is a classification for "vases with a picture of
                    satyrs and maenads below the mid band." Although made in Athens, it is almost
                    certain that the Nikosthenic amphora was never meant for a Greek clientele but,
                    like the kyathos (see <bibl>Moon 1979, no.
                    69</bibl>), it was export ware for the Etruscans. Most of the amphorae of known
                    provenience were found in Etruria at Caere, and the schemes used for decoration,
                    though in myriad combinations, are routine and largely without much iconographic
                    interest or complexity. The decoration is plentiful and garish on most, charming
                    and calculated on a few, particularly those in the Six technique (see <rs
                        type="vase">Columbia 58.12</rs>), for example <rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre F 114</rs> (<bibl>ABV,
                    226</bibl>). It is thought that the Six technique itself was formulated in this
                    same workshop. Scenes of boxers, with caldrons and tripods for the victor, are
                    as common on these amphorae as they were popular in Etruscan tomb painting, for
                    example, in The Tomb of the Monkeys.</p>
                <p>Although the main frieze easily places this vase into a larger group,
                    there are unusual features. The elaborate floral patterns (also on the Cleveland
                    amphora) instead of figures (see <rs type="vase">Kansas City
                    41-50</rs>) on the handle are unusual, and the winged female on the neck of the
                    vase appears infrequently. M. Eisman suggests a date between 535-520 B. C. for
                    the Thiasos Group, and he finds it closely related to Chalcidian amphorae (see
                        <rs type="vase">Minneapolis WF 9</rs>) and to early examples of
                    kyathoi (<bibl>"Nikosthenic Amphorai: The J. Paul
                        Getty Museum Amphora,"<title>The J. Paul Getty Museum
                            Journal</title> 1 (1974) 44, nn. 7 and 8</bibl>; see also pp. 52-54 for
                    an overview of the Nikosthenic workshop).</p>
                <p>Various stylistic prototypes for this shape have been suggested. The
                    flat handles, raised ribs, and imitation rivets at the handles indicate metal
                    vases (<bibl>H.R.W. Smith 1932, 101</bibl>); the
                    conoid neck would suggest an Italian prototype, from the Villanovans and
                    Etruscans. In fact, a bucchero amphora in New York, <rs type="vase"
                        >New York GR 972</rs>, may be the type of Italic vase which directly
                    influenced the Attic production (<bibl>Gallatin
                        1926, 76-78</bibl>). The Italic or Etruscan forerunners for the shape‚Äî
                    whether metal or ceramic bucchero imitating metal‚Äîwere not painted; the
                    decorative motives one sees on the amphorae are Greek, flamboyant and
                    exaggerated, designed to appeal to another side of Etruscan or Caeretan taste.</p>

                <p>M. L. Katzev attributed the vase by shape to this Class which is a
                    subgroup to the Nikosthenic amphorae of more regular designs, such as the
                    example in the exhibition from the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum in Kansas City
                    (see <rs type="vase">Kansas City 52.22</rs>); it is most closely
                    paralleled in shape by an amphora in Paris, <rs type="vase">Louvre
                        F 115</rs> (<bibl>ABV, 319, no. 4</bibl>). The
                    neck-amphorae brought together by Beazley under the Class of Cabinet des
                    M√©dailles 218 were painted by divers hands (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 1618</bibl>); concerning the attribution of this vase
                    to a specific decorator, Dr. Evelyn Bell wrote (1973, in a letter to the Allen
                    Museum), "... a black-figure panel amphora, <rs type="vase">San
                        Simeon 5482</rs>, seems to be by the same artist." Katzev believed that the
                    artist of the Oberlin vase painted two other white-ground neck-amphorae. The
                    first is in Boston, <rs type="vase">Boston 01.17</rs> (<bibl
                       >ABV, 319, no. 2</bibl>) which is similar not
                    only in style but in iconography, and Beazley names the artist after this vase.
                    The second neck-amphora is in the collection of Dr. Peter Ludwig at Aachen which
                    is assigned by Lullies to the Leagros Group (<bibl

                <p>Inscriptional evidence has led scholars like Kirchhoff and Rumpf <hi
                        rend="ital">(infra,</hi> p. 41) to conclude that vases in this
                    style and fabric were made at Chalcis, in Euboea. Dipinti or painted
                    inscriptions on the vases, they felt, compared favorably to legends on coins and
                    stones from this Greek city which is not far from Athens. Nevertheless,
                    authorities are still divided as to the source of production. Nothing of this
                    fabric has actually been found at Chalcis. H.R.W. Smith (<bibl
                       >H.R.W. Smith 1932, pp. 98-102, 108</bibl>) suggested that,
                    because of similarities with Etruscan bucchero, "Chalcidian" fabric was made in
                    Etruria itself, at philhellenic and partly Hellenized Agylla-Caere ‚Äî the
                    place most likely to have harbored a group of Greek potters (for the Nikosthenic
                    workshop, see <bibl>Moon 1979, No. 38</bibl> [<rs
                        type="vase">Kansas City 52.22</rs>]). Smith also reminds us
                    that the fabric could have been made by Etruscans or more likely by Chalcidian
                    settlers in Kyme, Neapolis, or Rhegion, or in various places in Chalcidian
                    Sicily (<bibl>H.R.W. Smith 1932, pp. 101-102</bibl>)
                    and these claims have been supported more recently by other scholars (see <rs
                        type="vase">Milwaukee N 17928/22266</rs>, "Milwaukee Cup").
                    "Chalcis, in Euboea, could be assumed as the source if any major mainland
                    pottery imitated Chalcidian motives or shapes" (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, No. 27</bibl>). Smith felt this very strongly
                        (<bibl>H.R.W. Smith 1932, p. 103</bibl>) and the
                    "Milwaukee Cup," as discussed by the Raubitscheks, may be evidence strengthening
                    the "mainland" view.</p>
                <p>The orange-yellow color of the clay of this amphora from the T.B.
                    Walker Foundation, its flaky texture and matt finish, are typical of the fabric.
                    The finish of the areas in reservation feels soapy and seems pale and
                    underfired, while the black-glazed decoration is shiny and rich. The black
                    designs are almost in relief from the background. Such discrepancies force one
                    to assume that the chalky clay-body needed a higher firing temperature for
                    vitrification (probably like Corinthian clay). Chalcidian decorators used
                    positioning marks for their designs ‚Äî simple vertical and horizontal
                    lines ‚Äî not preliminary drawings or even rough sketches in the soft clay;
                    the latter can be found on some Athenian pots (<bibl
                        >Rumpf 1927, p. 127</bibl>). Although the cracks in this amphora make it
                    difficult, one can observe the rudimentary guidelines common to Chalcis. One can
                    also note that some designs seem to have an aura or halo because of the way they
                    were painted on the vase: i.e., first the outline is drawn in black glaze
                    applied with a thin brush, then the silhouette is made by filling in the
                    contours with a second, thicker application. In later Chalcidian pottery a
                    relief line was used (<bibl>Rumpf 1927, p.
                    129</bibl>). The Minnesota amphora is unattributed but it seems to be the work
                    of the painter of an amphora of similar design, now in Germany, <rs type="vase"
                       >Munich 593</rs> (<bibl>Rumpf 1927,
                        no. 103, pl. CVII</bibl>). The incised detail on the cocks is identical and
                    the subsidiary decoration is very close.</p>
                <p>This amphora is a belly or one-piece amphora, made in a single
                    movement of the potter's hands, but in its mode of decoration ‚Äî black
                    lip, palmette-lotus frieze on the neck, shoulder frieze of animals, main frieze
                    of animals, black median band and rays ‚Äî it looks more like the
                    Chalcidian neck-amphora. In this regard it is very unusual. This type of
                    belly-amphora was probably borrowed from Corinth about the time of the Tydeus
                    Painter (see <rs type="vase">St. Louis WU 3267</rs>). Rumpf
                    presumed this because of the spherical belly, echinus foot, and the absence of a
                    ring or raised fillet above the foot (<bibl>Rumpf
                        1927, p. 120</bibl>). For Chalcidian Pottery, <bibl

                    with dots in the interstices, and directly above the foot, a zone of rays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A: shoulder:</hi> a fight, between nude
                    horsemen, between onlookers. On the left stands a woman (I) dressed in a peplos
                    and in front of her a nude youth (2), both right. They are followed by a
                    horseman (3), also to right. Next are the two combatants (4 and 5), each dressed
                    in a short chiton and holding out a round shield (device on 5: balls). A
                    scabbard is suspended from a baldric over the right shoulder of each, and right
                    arm is raised, as if to hurl a spear, but the artist forgot to include it. On
                    the right of the warriors is the second horseman (6), to left, and in back of
                    him, two more onlookers, a male (7) with a cloak over both shoulders and boots
                    and hat, and a woman (8) dressed as her counterpart on the left. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Body:</hi> Poseidon and Amphitrite in a chariot to right. The
                    two deities stand in the chariot, Amphitrite on the right-hand side holding the
                    reins in both hands, Poseidon on the left holding his trident in his right hand
                    and reaching down with his left to grasp the top of the breastwork of the
                    chariot to steady himself when the vehicle starts to move. Each deity wears a
                    long chiton with a himation over it. Round the head of Amphitrite is a wreath,
                    round Poseidon's a fillet. A team of four draws the chariot, the two trace
                    horses being slightly ahead of the two pole horses, which supply the main
                    pulling power. This composition is the standard convention for the
                    representation of four chariot horses in profile, but in reality, the four were
                    probably abreast (see below). The right-hand trace horse is branded on the croup
                    with a dot-rosette. On the left-hand side of the team are two deities, an
                    unidentified goddess at right, gesturing to Hermes who stands to right, looking
                    round. The goddess wears a peplos. Round her head is a fillet. Hermes is clad in
                    a short chiton and cloak, and the brim of his petasos is turned up in the back.
                    In his right hand he holds a kerykeion. The area of glaze in back of the
                    goddess's left forearm is unintelligible. It cannot be part of her peplos or of
                    Hermes' cloak, for these garments are clearly defined. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B: shoulder:</hi> a fight, with horsemen and onlookers,
                    similar to the one on A. On the left, a woman (1), dressed in a peplos, stands
                    to right, preceded by a youth (2) with a cloak, and a horseman (3), both to
                    right. Then come the combatants (4 and 5), each holding out a round shield seen
                    in profile. The left warrior is nude and almost down on his right knee; the
                    right wears a short chiton and appears more aggressive. As on the obverse, each
                    has his right arm raised, but lacks a spear. On the right of the pair is the
                    second horseman (6) and in back of him, three onlookers, to left. The first (7)
                    may be Hermes, for he holds a kerykeion and wears boots in addition to his cloak
                    and petasos. Then comes a youth (8) and a woman (9) each dressed in a long
                    chiton. <hi rend="ital">Body:</hi> departure of warrior. On the
                    left stands a man to right, wearing only a cloak and fillet, his left hand
                    raised in a gesture of farewell. In front of him, a woman in a long chiton with
                    a cloak over it and a fillet round her head bids farewell to the youthful
                    warrior (no beard appears below the cheekpiece of his helmet) in front of her
                    who steps to right, looking round. He wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet, a
                    short pleated chiton with a corslet over it, and greaves. A sword is suspended
                    from a baldric over his right shoulder (some of the scabbard appears in back
                    just above the warrior's chiton) and on his left arm he carries a round shield
                    seen in profile (device: tripod). The picture is completed on the right by the
                    youth standing to left wearing a long chiton with a cloak over it. <hi

                <p>This type of neck-amphora with a broad, flat shoulder is not a very
                    frequent type and all of the known examples may be dated between 540 and 520

                    Exekias, and the painter's style shows certain similarities to that of the early
                    work of the master.</p>
                <p>The subject of A suggests a departure, particularly because Hermes is
                    present. Since Amphitrite drives the chariot, which is unusual, perhaps she and
                    Poseidon are on their way to the Gigantomachy: on the north frieze of the
                    Siphnian Treasury, slabs D and E show Amphitrite guiding Poseidon's chariot as
                    he attacks two oncoming giants (see <rs type="sculpture">Delphi,
                        Siphnian Treasury Frieze--North</rs>; cf. most recently, <hi rend="ital"
                       >BCH</hi> Supp. 4 [1977] 316-317, figs. 8-9), and she may have
                    driven his chariot in the splendid representation of this battle by Lydos on <rs

                    For the harnessing of an actual chariot team in antiquity, cf.<bibl
                       >Spruyette 1977, esp. pp. 53-69</bibl> for the Greek chariot.
                    Spruyette has shown that it would not be necessary for the trace horses to be
                    slightly ahead of the pole horses, as they appear in nearly all representations
                    of the chariot in profile in archaic Greek sculpture and painting. Very likely,
                    this manner of representing the team is a convention used to clarify the
                    elements of the composition. The only exception to this arrangement in Attic
                    black-figure known to me occurs on <rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L
                        307</rs>, a hydria in the manner of the Antimenes Painter (<bibl
                       >ABV, 276, no. 4</bibl>). Here, the four horses
                    are shown abreast and the composition appears very dense and crowded.</p>
                <p>From about 550 B.C., brands occasionally appear on painted horses.
                    The earliest example seems to be the swastika incised on the croup of a mount
                    painted on the hydria in Basel attributed to the Archippe Painter by Bothmer
                        (<bibl>AntK 12 [1969] pls. 17-18</bibl>). In
                    reality, they were probably marks of ownership, value, or breeding. Cf., most

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. 18.9 cm; D. 31.6 cm;
                    W. 41.0 cm; D. of foot 14.0 cm; liquid contents ca. 4.4 liters. Dense, fine clay
                    with tight structure, few pores, some inclusions and lime impurities. 2.5 YR 7/8
                    light red (Munsell). The kylix has been reconstituted from a number of large
                    fragments and some minor restorations have been made in plaster. The most
                    noticeable loss is the gap over the right chariot on Side B, where the heads of
                    some figures are missing. Added red and white is in generally poor to fair
                    condition, although some small areas remain fresh. The dense glaze is of a
                    saturated black color, in places shading towards a dark brown to brown. The
                    added white has widely faded, however the red is generally in good condition.</p>
                <p>The cup rests on a high stem with a wide, splayed disk foot. Its
                    hollowed underside rises in a steady curve from the resting surface all the way
                    to the bottom of the basin. The disk's slightly concave exterior edge has been
                    precisely molded, forming a gentle ridge around the upper circumference of the
                    foot. A shallow molding separates stem and basin; the latter curves broadly
                    outwards, changing into the almost vertical rim with thickened lip. The round
                    handles curve upwards and out, the left one (from Side A) hangs a bit low, the
                    apex of the right one exceeds the height of the lip.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the underside and exterior edge of the foot,
                    and a reserved band low around the basin, the whole vessel is glazed. Small
                    areas are left reserved: the inside of the handles as well as their attachment
                    panels, a narrow band encircling the lip, and the interior bottom, where a large
                    reserved circle encompasses a smaller one with a second, broader circle around
                    it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The figurative
                    decoration of the band cup consists of a total of 69 human figures, four
                    chariots and 16 horses. The participants are more or less evenly distributed
                    between sides A and B; large sub-divisions, marked only by a change of direction
                    in various figures' gazes, punctuate the rather uniform line of figures.</p>
                <p>The procession on either side crowds around and between two quadrigas
                    whose horses stand among the file of participants. Each side is organized in a
                    slightly different fashion, however. <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi>
                    shows a woman who unveils herself in the very center of the composition, framed
                    symmetrically by four participants who look at her. The remaining segments of
                    Side A are filled with persons facing various directions, usually at least two
                    of them gazing the same way. Towards the handles the composition seems to open
                    up slightly; here more loosely spaced groups of four look from the handles
                    towards the middle. <hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> a similar
                    arrangement has been chosen for the groups near the handles. However, through
                    the insertion of two grooms in clearly defined interstices before each chariot,
                    the main rhythm of the composition of Side B compared to Side A has been
                    changed. Its basic components are the two frieze sections starting at the left
                    side and flowing all the way over to the right where the second chariot is met
                    by a group of onlookers moving to the left, that is, away from the handles.</p>
                <p>The principal effect of this colorful tour de force in miniature
                    rests on the simple design of the figures, which are often outlined only roughly
                    in silhouette, to be refined in their appearance through the use of incision and
                    added color. A case in point is the central group of nine figures on Side A. At
                    the center stands a woman facing left. With her right hand, which also holds a
                    dot-wreath, she lifts her cloak which covers the back of her head and unveils
                    her face. Her forward left hand appears under her left breast, hardly
                    distinguishable among the scale-pattern on her peplos. The fold of the peplos at
                    her waist is rendered by a double incised line, as is the lower hem above her
                    ankles. A white chiton falls from beneath the peplos, covering most of her
                    elongated feet; some of the white glaze is gone. The face is set off in a rather
                    unbecoming "pig-headed" profile, reserved against the added red of the cloak but
                    certainly once executed in added white. As a matter of course, this painter
                    seems not to use incision for human profiles; the only notable exception to this
                    is the hooked nose of the white clad charioteer on the right chariot, Side A.</p>
                <p>Within the woman's face a thin incised line renders the large, flat,
                    triangular eye; this treatment of the eye is repeated in another female figure,
                    the third on her left. The hairline of the central woman, rather carelessly
                    done, frames a low forehead. It continues around a cursorily executed ear to
                    fall to the shoulder. A short line indicates the tug of the cloak under the left
                    axle, longer incised lines mark the protrusion of the left arm and the drape of
                    the cloak, ending in two double-border lines. The same sketchiness and looseness
                    characterizes the lines which outline her body profile and the line of her cloak
                    as it touches the sleeve of the older man facing her. Two quick strokes of added
                    red on her head indicate a wreath.</p>
                <p>On either side the woman is flanked by four figures: two men, a woman
                    and again a man, all facing her. The males carry spears before them, holding
                    them staff-like in their right hands. The persons framing the unveiling woman
                    are typical of all the figures encircling the band cup. The bodies appear
                    slender and almost planklike under their garments; the feet are long, thin, and
                    barely articulated.</p>
                <p>To a large degree the representational effect depends on the
                    incisions. They serve, in the first place, to separate the bodies, whose primary
                    drawing is very sketchy. Firm, angular, incised lines help to differentiate
                    larger color design patterns, mostly for the wide, flowing subdivisions of the
                    cloaks. The coloring remains simple; it usually consists of large segments of
                    added red or of agglomerations of sizeable dots of the same color. The dividing
                    line between neck and garment is either single or double without a consistent
                    pattern.</p>
                <p>The women's faces were originally executed in added white. The woman
                    to the right shows a fine "ghost" of such an original silhouette; even better
                    preserved is the face of the girl in the group to the left, which clearly shows
                    the rather large face with long nose, the finely outlined eyes, and the strong
                    jawline. The hair of both females flows down over the shoulder in open waves,
                    longer with the figure at the left, short and narrower at the right. Like the
                    central figure, both women wear a wreath rendered by two short strokes in added
                    red.</p>
                <p>The male heads, frequently with their hair in added red, fall into
                    two basic categories, bearded and unbearded. For the youthful faces one usually
                    finds one more-or-less continuous line from the forehead around the ear down to
                    the neck, separating face and scalp. A short, comma-like stroke indicates the
                    anatomical details of the ear. The eye is seen frontally, ranging in form from
                    almost round to almond-shaped. A single short line (sometimes two) forms the
                    mouth; the same holds true for the eyebrows. In the bearded faces the line from
                    the forehead bends in front of the ear and continues to outline the inner face
                    against the beard. The ear, often much more carefully done on bearded men than
                    on younger men, is clearly defined and curved. Its outline touches the lower
                    border of the beard; the hairline at the neck often joins it as well. Sometimes
                    the lower edge of the beard may be either omitted or it may be formed by a
                    series of short, curved strokes, conveying curling, unruly hair. This design
                    along the jaw of the second man to the left of the unveiling woman might portray
                    a newly sprouted beard.</p>
                <p>Other noticeable figures, on both Sides A and B, are the charioteers,
                    all dressed in the customary long garb. The right charioteer (Side A) has its
                    added white rather well-preserved and the original effect of the cloth and its
                    drape is clearest here. The two nude figures of the grooms in front of the
                    horses on Side B are swiftly drawn. Their small, rather short torsos rest on
                    heavy, long thighs which are set on short lower legs. The thighs are separated
                    by incised lines; the central thigh muscle, some body musculature, and the arms
                    have also been rendered by incised line.</p>
                <p>The horses of the four chariots, all somewhat different, show a
                    nervous liveliness, their well-articulated legs in a colorful multitude of
                    positions. The rendering of the animals is generally more exacting than that of
                    the humans, and the details seem to have been carried out with greater care. A
                    long line marks the musculature along the belly, curved lines paralleled by
                    bands in added red mark the hindquarters, and similar markings occur also on the
                    chest. The manes have either been laid out in smooth added red so that they
                    stand up in short, bristly strokes, or they fall over the side of the neck in
                    tidy strands with the lower edges outlined in a wiggly manner. The bit in the
                    mouth and the large, round eye in a well-defined socket area are the main
                    features in the bridled heads. some horses' necks are set off in added red;
                    other noticeable use of decoration occurs in the small scalelike incisions of
                    the harness.</p>
                <p>It is not clear whether this richly decorated frieze tells a story or
                    whether it is a general representation, like an unidentified wedding or
                    procession. For example, women lifting their veils appear commonly in marriage
                    scenes: cf. a kylix by the Amasis Painter (<bibl
                        >Karouzou 1956, pl. 12</bibl>) where the bride, like the central figure on
                    Side A, also holds a wreath. However, the size of the crowd, the presence of
                    four chariots (rather than only one) may indicate that the event is a procession
                    or assembly, the meaning of which is still to be uncovered. The four quadrigae
                    seem to play an important role; all of them carry an older charioteer together
                    with a youth who, clad in a long cloak, stands between the former's outstretched
                    arms. The youths all seem to hold a whip or stave in their right hands,
                    projecting from their cloaks. Also characteristic of a procession is the rather
                    rigid presentation of the other participants, which lends a certain hieratic,
                    formal air to the whole scene. The very evenly rhythmic composition of the
                    frieze, employing carefully designed groupings of figures, further indicates
                    that the artist wanted to capture a particular spirit for which he went into
                    painstaking detail.</p>
                <p>This band cup is a fine example of the Little Master Cups which
                    flourished around the middle of the sixth century and thereafter (cf. <bibl
                       >Beazley 1951, 52-56</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Boardman 1974, pls. 114, 116-117</bibl>). However, with the
                    tight planning of its figurative decoration and the precise placing of its
                    figures, it remains unusual within this group. Normally, Little Master Cups
                    employ a freer use of space (see <rs type="vase">Columbia
                    69.111</rs>), often placing figures in an almost gem-like manner against the
                    void of the background as on cups by the Amasis Painter in Madrid and Cracow
                        (<bibl>von Bothmer 1971, pls. 24, 25</bibl>).
                    But despite the seemingly monotone rhythm of the frieze and the plethora of
                    figures, the painter succeeded in supplying his figures with a certain
                    liveliness, relying for this effect upon a great variety of facial expressions.</p>
                <p>In shape, the band cup resembles quite closely two in Munich:<rs
                        type="vase">Munich 2243</rs>, signed by Archikles and Glaukytes
                        (<bibl>Arias &amp; Hirmer 1962, pl.
                    50</bibl>, and <rs type="vase">Munich 2238</rs>, <bibl
                       >Greifenhagen 1971, 85, figs. 7, 8</bibl>). The latter has a
                    similar foot; its painting, furthermore, conveys a related tendency towards
                    crowding, as in the frieze, although the action is-on one side-considerably more
                    agitated.</p>

                <p>The Centaur Painter belonged to the group of miniaturists who
                    decorated the so-called "Little Master Cups" in the second half of the sixth
                    century B.C. He specialized in cups and, in addition to band cups, such as our
                    example, a number of lip cups are known by his hand. His small, lively figures
                    are bright with added color which the artist liked to use freely. The figures
                    fit perfectly on the small cup but close examination shows that they share the
                    problems of representation common in sixth century painting, such as profile
                    legs with a frontal chest.</p>

                    lines above and below, marks the junction of the base to the vase proper. Under
                    the base is an "Alpha-rho" graffito. The same mark appears on the foot of the
                    hydria by the Affecter in Madrid (<bibl>ABV, 247,
                        no. 92</bibl>).</p>
                <p>At first glance this hydria by the Affecter seems much earlier in
                    date, by twenty years, in terms of the shape in Attica, and still more
                    old-fashioned because of the use of certain decorative schemes. Of the more than
                    one hundred vases attributed to him, only three are hydriai, and these seem to
                    appear in the last years of his production, closer to 520 B.C. The pouring
                    handle here and on the other complete hydria in Madrid (<rs type="vase"
                       >Madrid 10919</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 247,
                        no. 92</bibl>; <bibl>Mommsen 1975, no. 90, pl.
                        98</bibl>) does not rise above the lip, contrary to contemporary fashion
                    (see <rs type="vase">Cleveland 75.1</rs>, <rs type="vase"
                       >Toledo 1961.23</rs>, <rs type="vase">Toledo
                        1950.261</rs>, <rs type="vase">Madison 68.14.1</rs>; <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, nos. 48, 61, 66, 67</bibl>). The neck
                    itself is low and broad, cylindrical instead of funnel-shaped, the shoulder is
                    rounded, not set-off, that is, nearer to hydriai of an earlier generation (see
                        <rs type="vase">Columbia 72.22</rs>). While the double-rounded
                    foot is early, the handles show definite contemporary features in the size,
                    shape and angle of attachment. The shoulder frieze is wider than the picture
                    panel, a format expected of the mid-sixth century. The painter's name derives
                    from this archaism, which is extensive and deliberate. The heart-shaped red and
                    black ivy leaves, which laterally frame his panel and shoulder scenes, can be
                    found earlier on hydriai and on the handles of some cups, (e.g., <rs type="vase"
                       >Boston 99.518</rs>, "Merrythought cup" by the Painter of Boston
                    Polyphemus [<bibl>ABV, 198</bibl>]). His use of
                    small white dots in series adds exoticism and preserves the flatness of his
                    figurative scenes. The rows of dots recall Lydos, the Painter of Berlin 1686
                    (see <bibl>Moon 1979, No. 31</bibl>) and the painter
                    of the St. Louis pyxis in the late Corinthian red-ground style (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, No. 28</bibl>). Red dots in rows
                    which decorate the charioteer's robe on this vase appear frequently, especially
                    on his earlier vases, e.g., neck-amphora, <rs type="vase">Boston
                        01.8053</rs> (<bibl>Mommsen 1975, no. 15, pl.
                    24</bibl>). The Amasis Painter decorates the clothes of his figures similarly
                    e.g., shoulder lekythos in New York (<rs type="vase">New York
                        56.11.1</rs>; <bibl>D. von Bothmer, <title
                           >AntK</title> 3.2 [1960] 73, pl. 7.2</bibl>). The Boston
                    vase by the Affecter has a floral frieze above the picture panel which seems to
                    take inspiration from Tyrrhenian amphorae, e.g., <rs type="vase"
                        >Louvre E 861</rs>, a neck-amphora by the Omaha Painter (<bibl
                       >Para., 33</bibl>). Tyrrhenian amphorae may have contributed
                    to the art of the Affecter the rare double row of rays above the foot
                    (Tyrrhenian <rs type="vase">Louvre E 861</rs>), possibly through
                    the agency of the Amasis Painter. For shield devices, the free-standing
                    protomai, the writhing snake at which the striding warrior aims (picture panel)
                    and the horse's head and foreparts on an Amazon's shield (shoulder scene) can be
                    compared to the blazons found on Tyrrhenian amphorae (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, No. 45</bibl>). In fact the peculiar shape of
                    neck-amphora which the Affecter preferred to decorate looks similar to these
                    Tyrrhenians and to some earlier Panathenaics.<note place="unspecified"
                        anchored="true">
                        <p>"Since the Omaha Painter is not Tyrrhenian, Tyrrhenian cannot
                            be said to have passed the double rays on the the Affecter." (Letter of
                            Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb. 1980)</p>
                    </note></p>
                <p>Like the Amasis Painter (see <rs type="vase">Bloomington
                        71.82</rs>) the painting style of the Affecter is light and playful. The
                    tunic of the warrior in the chariot-car is delicately incised with details of a
                    human face. The face may have been apotropaic but it is treated comically,
                    having small eyes with red centers and a long nose. Such highly individualistic
                    style was doubtless the result of considerable business acumen. Nearly all of
                    the Affecter's pottery has been found in Etruria and at Naukratis.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> H. to top of handle 47.0
                    cm; H. to rim 45.6 cm; D. of rim 23.2 cm; D. of shoulder 29.5 cm; D. of foot
                    15.5 cm. Vertical handle and fragment of lip broken and repaired; small area of
                    loss in the field above the second and third horses' heads and in the field
                    behind the horses' legs; much of the black glaze has fired olive green.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Main scene:</hi> A chariot turning. The car and the
                    wheels of the chariot are shown frontally, while the bodies of the four horses
                    are in profile, facing right. The charioteer on the left, in the chariot, and
                    the warrior also face right. The heads of the trace-horses are in profile, those
                    of the pole-horses frontal and side by side, their necks turned inward. In front
                    of the horses, on the far right of the scene, is another warrior, on foot,
                    moving right, but looking back left. The charioteer wears a long robe which is
                    belted with tie-strings that cross in front and pass over each shoulder. He
                    holds the reins and a pair of goads in his right hand; his left hand is not
                    visible. A Boeotian shield hangs from his back. He leans slightly forward,
                    gazing intently, as he maneuvers the chariot through its turn. The warrior
                    riding with him wears a high-crested Corinthian helmet and also gazes intently.
                    The warrior on foot wears a high-crested Corinthian helmet, a corslet, a baldric
                    from which a scabbard is suspended, a short chiton and greaves. He carries a
                    pair of spears and a circular shield, its device a tripod. The warriors are
                    bearded, the charioteer is not. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> The
                    charioteer's tie-strings, belt and shield border; the upper border and the tail
                    of the helmet-crest of the warrior on foot, the borders of his shield and
                    greaves, and the dots on the skirt of his chiton; the manes and breast-bands of
                    all four horses, the tails of three of them, and part of the chariot. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added white:</hi> The charioteer's robe; the
                    baldric of the warrior on foot, his shield device, a row of dots on the inner
                    edge of his helmet-crest, the collar of his chiton and two rows of dots framing
                    an incised pattern on its skirt; the teeth of the trace-horses and patches on
                    the heads of the pole-horses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Shoulder:</hi> Herakles and Cerberus.
                    Herakles (second from right) moves right and looks back at Cerberus whom he
                    leads on a leash. He holds the leash in his right hand and brandishes a club
                    with his left. He wears a baldric over his right shoulder, a sword at his right
                    side and a quiver at his left. Athena, at the far right, stands facing Herakles,
                    her right hand raised; in her left hand she holds a spear pointed downward.
                    Hermes (third from the left) stands behind Cerberus, his left arm raised, the
                    kerykeion in his right. Persephone stands behind Hermes, her left hand raised.
                    Her right arm is bent at the elbow; the fingers of her extended right hand point
                    downward. Behind her, at the far left, stands Pluto. He holds a staff in his
                    left hand; his right arm and hand are muffled in his himation. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red:</hi> Folds in the garments of Pluto, Persephone,
                    Hermes and Athena; the beards of Pluto, Hermes and Herakles; the upper edge of
                    Athena's helmet-crest; dots on the skirt of Herakles' chiton, on the flaps of
                    his quiver and on the ruff of the lion skin; Cerberus' collar. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> The flesh of Persephone and Athena; alternate
                    locks of hair on Cerberus' mane; the teeth of the lion skin; the hilt of
                    Herakles' sword, the chape of its scabbard and baldric; dots on Athena's
                    clothing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Predella:</hi> Between upright palmettes
                    (left to right), a boar, a lion and a boar. The boars face inward, the lion
                    faces right. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> The shoulders of both
                    boars and a stroke on the rump of the boar on the left; the lion's tongue and
                    dots on its shoulder; the cores of the palmettes.</p>
                <p>A band of black tongues appears around the upper side of the mouth
                    (see below). A band of alternating black and red tongues appears at the base of
                    the neck. The lateral borders of the main scene are double rows of ivy leaves.
                    There are two red lines below the predella and rays around the base. The base
                    fillet is painted with added red.</p>
                <p>The attribution to the Karithaios Painter was made by Dietrich von
                    Bothmer (cf. <bibl>ABV, 161</bibl>). The chariot
                    wheeling round was a popular subject in Attic black-figure during the latter
                    half of the sixth century B.C. The Toledo hydria may reveal some influence of
                    the Lysippides Painter; cf. <bibl>B. Schl√∂
                        rb-Vierneisel, <title>AthMitt</title> 81 (1966) 261 and

                <p>Decoration on the upper side of the mouth, as here, is unusual and is
                    known on only four other hydriai. The tongue-pattern on the upper side of the
                    mouth appears on a hydria in Lyons related to the Antimenes Painter (<bibl

                    in Vulci (<bibl><title
                        >ArchCl</title> 23 [1971] 111-112 and pl. 36</bibl>); and also, as Prof.
                    Moon informs me, on a hydria by the Antimenes Painter in Omaha, Nebraska (<rs
                        type="vase">Omaha 44.153</rs>).</p>
                <p>The fourth hydria with decoration on the upper side of the mouth is
                    in Minneapolis (<bibl>Para., 119, no. 8</bibl>

                    the Minneapolis hydria has a picture, a chariot race on the upper side of the
                    mouth, and is attributed to the Antimenes Painter.<note place="unspecified"

                    hoplites in full panoply are engaged in single combat. A third warrior (l.) has
                    just fallen beneath them. This central group is flanked, at left and right, by a
                    pair of warriors, poised for action, spears raised. The fallen warrior has lost
                    his spear, and perhaps his greaves. He wears a Corinthian helmet with a high
                    crest, a bronze corslet and a short chiton, as well as baldric and sword. The
                    round shield carried on his left arm is seen in strict profile view. This fallen
                    warrior has not yet given up the fight. In defense he extends his shield-arm
                    over his body and gestures (or prepares to throw a stone) with his right hand.
                    High crests alternate with low ones on the Corinthian helmets of the other
                    warriors. Like the fallen one, these fighting hoplites wear short chitons,
                    baldrics and sheathed swords. They too wear corslets of bronze, except the
                    leftmost warrior whose corslet seems to be of leather. They all wear greaves.
                    The flanking warriors carry round shields on their left arms. These shields are
                    angled so that a bit of the interior of each can be seen. The shield at the left
                    is wreathed with ivy; the one at the right has a device of three balls. The
                    right-hand warrior of the central group (l.) also carries a round shield. It is
                    held parallel to the picture plane, and its bold device, a triskeles, is clearly
                    displayed. Only his opponent (r.) carries a Boeotian shield, held parallel to
                    the picture plane as well, but viewed from the interior.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> Dionysos and satyrs.
                    Dionysos (r.) stands at the center. The bearded god is clad in a chiton and
                    himation, and crowned by a wreath of ivy. In his left hand he holds a drinking
                    horn. He is flanked by two satyrs on each side: all four satyrs face him. The
                    outermost satyrs dance most vigorously, each with one arm up. The satyr behind
                    Dionysos is ithyphallic. A palmette-lotus festoon fills the horizontal border
                    above each panel. On A it consists of twenty-three palmette-lotuses, on B of
                    twenty-two. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> stripes on crests of

                <p>In 1942 Sir John Beazley considered the Cleveland vase to be in the
                    Manner of the Andokides Painter (<bibl>ARV1, 5,
                    no.4</bibl>; by 1956 he had changed his mind and called it Manner of the
                    Lysippides Painter <bibl>ABV, 257-258, no.
                    4</bibl>), an opinion he was to hold henceforth (<bibl
                       >Para., 114-115</bibl>). The mere mention of this pair of
                    vase-painter names still unleashes a controversy (<bibl
                       >Boardman 1975, 15-17</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Boardman 1974, 105</bibl>; <bibl
                        >B. Cohen 1978, 1-193</bibl>). The Andokides Painter, named after a potter,
                    was probably the inventor of the red-figure technique. It is agreed that he
                    painted entirely red-figured pots, as well as the red-figure halves of
                    bilinguals, special vases decorated in black-figure on one side and in
                    red-figure on the other (<bibl>ARV2, 3-5 and
                    1617</bibl>). The question has been whether the black-figure halves of these
                    bilinguals, as well as some entirely black-figured vases, should be attributed
                    to him, or to a second artist. Beazley called the black-figure hand the
                    Lysippides Painter, after a kalos name on a neck-amphora in the British Museum
                        (<rs type="vase">London B 211</rs>; <bibl
                       >ABV, 256, no. 14</bibl>; <bibl
                        >Beazley 1928a, 25, 38-41</bibl>). A precise classification of the Cleveland
                    vase depends upon a solution to the Andokides-Lysippides problem. Among the
                    criteria for separating the two hands, one is especially significant for our
                    context. The black-figure artist was a follower, and probably a student of the
                    great master Exekias; the red-figure Andokides Painter was neither (<bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, 2, 106 f.</bibl>). The painter of
                    the Cleveland amphora appears to have worked entirely within the realm of the
                    old technique; this pot is undoubtedly in the manner of a separate, black-figure
                    Lysippides Painter.</p>
                <p>Two specific Lysippidean groups have been distinguished. Those vases
                    related to <rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L 391</rs> (<bibl
                       >ABV, 262, no. 45</bibl>), a mastos by the Mastos
                    Painter, comprise the <hi rend="ital">Mastos</hi> Group. Here the
                    quality is high (<bibl>ABV, 257</bibl>). At one time
                    the Cleveland vase was attributed to the Mastos Painter himself (<bibl
                       >von Bothmer 1953a, p. 136</bibl>). Now it is the
                    name-piece of the second, the so-called Bateman Group (<bibl
                       >ABV, 257</bibl>). "Bateman" commemorates the "modern history"
                        (<bibl>von Bothmer 1953a, p.136</bibl>) of this
                    fine amphora, which has been in the collection of the Cleveland Museum since
                    1927. In 1926, in London, it was sold at auction, following the death of its
                    former owner, John Bateman, Esq. (<bibl>Cat.
                        Sotheby, June 21, 1926, p. 17, pl. 4</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Bateman Group is rather small. The publication of <hi rend="ital"
                       >Paralipomena</hi> increased its membership to five
                    black-figured vases (<rs type="vase">Cleveland 27.433</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 258, no. 4</bibl>; <rs type="vase"

                        <bibl>ABV, 258, no. 11</bibl>,<bibl
                       >Para., 114</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Boston

                    <hi rend="ital">ter</hi>); these may well represent the work of a
                    single painter. Four of the five are amphorae of type B, only one an amphora of
                    type A (<rs type="vase">New York 56.171.7</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 258, no. 11</bibl>, <bibl
                        >Para., 114</bibl>). The ornament, in the horizontal border above the panel,
                    on the reverse of the latter, is a palmette and lotus festoon, commonly found in
                    this location on amphorae of type B, like the one in Cleveland; usually a
                    palmette-lotus chain appears on type A. Clearly the master of the Bateman Group
                    was not accustomed to the newer amphora-shape. Exekias, as well as the
                    Lysippides Painter, already favored type A ‚Äî the popular amphora of the
                    early red-figure period (e.g. <rs type="vase">Vatican 344</rs>,
                        <bibl>ABV, 145, no. 13</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >Villa Giulia 24998</rs>, <bibl>ABV,

                        >ARV2, 7, no. 3</bibl>). Its shape marks the Cleveland amphora as somewhat
                    old-fashioned for its date.</p>
                <p>In iconography the scope of the Bateman Group is limited as well.
                    Four of the five amphorae have fight-scenes on their obverse sides. All the
                    fights are taken from myth and legend. The most special is Herakles and the
                    Amazons (<rs type="vase">New York 56.171.7</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 258, no. 11</bibl>, <bibl
                        >Para., 114</bibl>). In two others, Achilles and Memnon duel, watched by
                    their mothers, Thetis and Eos (<rs type="vase">Boston 89.256</rs>,
                        <bibl>Para., p. 115, 4</bibl>

                    <hi rend="ital">ter.</hi>). Both subjects survive in the oeuvre of
                    the Lysippides Painter (<rs type="vase">London B 426</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 256, no. 20</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >New York 58.32</rs>, <bibl>Para.,
                        114, no. 10 bis.</bibl>.) The central three-warrior grouping on <rs
                        type="vase">Boston 89.256</rs> of the Bateman Group is repeated
                    with but minor changes on the Cleveland amphora. Here, however, the subject
                    appears to be different; female onlookers have been replaced by a pair of
                    charging warriors. There are no inscriptions, and now the specific story cannot
                    be readily identified. Nevertheless, the Cleveland fight is certainly heroic
                    rather than real. The shield carried by the left-hand dueling warrior provides
                    the evidence. It is oval in form, and has a concave arc cut out at the center of
                    each long side. This type, generally called a Boeotian shield, was an invention
                    of the Greek artist ‚Äî a fantasy weapon belonging to legendary heroes
                        (<bibl>Snodgrass 1967, 55</bibl>). To make it
                    look convincing, artists equip the Boeotian shield with the bronze arm band and
                    leather handle characteristic of the round shields carried by Greek hoplites in
                    historical times, <hi rend="ital">(loc. cit.)</hi>.</p>
                <p>Various other details of the Cleveland fight-panel attract the
                    viewer's attention. The artist miscalculated the height of the composition, and
                    drew in a special groundline well above the lower edge of the panel to prevent
                    his too-short figures from floating. He confused front and back in drawing the
                    warrior at the far right. The ancient Greeks were right-handed; properly armed
                    warriors bear shields on their left arms and wield spears with their right
                    hands. The back of the upper torso of this leftfacing warrior must be toward the
                    viewer. In order not to interfere with his action, his sheathed sword should
                    hang at his back (cf. the other Cleveland warriors), but here it crosses his
                    chest. His chlamys is misdrawn as well. Its end is draped over his left shoulder
                        (<bibl>CVA, USA 15, Cleveland 1, p. 6, misread
                        as the right shoulder</bibl>), and falls upon his chest, rather than his
                    back. Some details have been quite carefully observed. The tail of the crest of
                    the fallen warrior's helmet responds to the downward pull of gravity. The
                    undersides of the beards of the fallen warrior and the leftmost warrior have
                    been indicated, extending beneath the lower edges of their helmets. The white
                    device of the dueling warrior's round shield is the focal point of the
                    composition. It is a triskeles ‚Äî a wheel comprised of three running human
                    legs attached at the hip (cf. <rs type="vase">London B 426</rs> by
                    the Lysippides Painter, <bibl>ABV, 256, no.
                    20</bibl>). A symbol of human industry (Schimmel), it is a fitting blazon for
                    the diligent artist of this vase.</p>
                <p>The god of wine surrounded by his followers, a common representation
                    in black-figure, plays an important role in the work of the Lysippides Painter
                    (e.g. <rs type="vase">Pregny</rs>, <rs type="vase"

                    reverse of four of the five amphorae of the Bateman Group. The Cleveland
                    composition is the least ambitious. In three of the four scenes Dionysos carries
                    a drinking horn (<rs type="vase">Cleveland 27.433</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 258, no. 4</bibl>; <rs type="vase"

                    <hi rend="ital">bis</hi>); this simple vessel suggests a rustic
                    setting. On <rs type="vase">New York 12.198.4</rs> Dionysos carries
                    the rhyton in his left hand and a vine of ivy in his right. On <rs type="vase"
                       >New York 56.171.7</rs> (<bibl>ABV,
                        258, no. 11</bibl>, <bibl>Para., 114</bibl>), a
                    kantharos has been substituted for the drinking horn; the god's left hand is
                    still poised as if to hold a vine, but it is empty. The ivy springs up
                    mysteriously behind the god's body. On the Cleveland amphora, the right hand of
                    the rhyton-carrying Dionysos is now lost beneath his himation, and there is no
                    ivy at all (cf. <rs type="vase">Boston 89.256</rs>, <bibl
                       >Para., 115, no. 4 bis</bibl>). Here the god is
                    flanked only by satyrs. On each of the other Bateman panels, Ariadne and/or
                    Hermes is present as well (cf. <rs type="vase">Oxford 208</rs>,
                        <bibl>ABV, 256, no. 15</bibl> and <rs
                        type="vase">Louvre F 204</rs>, <bibl
                       >ABV, 254, no. 1</bibl>, by the Lysippides Painter). The poses
                    of the Cleveland satyrs are drawn from a stock repertory.</p>
                <p>The black figures on the Cleveland vase are marionette-like in
                    appearance, but more slender than the Lysippides Painters' own. Their eyes,
                    extraordinarily round in shape, impart a wide-eyed look of innocence to their
                    faces. The pointed beard of the Cleveland Dionysos is distinctive; its lower
                    edge has a scalloped contour. The satyrs' red beards with individual hairs
                    incised along their lower contours, red forehead hair and red tails, follow
                    Lysippidean convention (cf. <rs type="vase">Cambridge 37.12</rs>,
                        <bibl>ABV, 257, no. 23</bibl>). The red circles
                    on their breasts indicate hair around the nipples (<bibl
                       >CVA, USA 12, Metropolitan Museum 3, p. 17</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Cleveland amphora of the Bateman Group represents conservative
                    black-figure tradition at its best. Much is obviously derived from Lysippidean
                    models, but the style of drawing is special; here it has a delicacy and a
                    measured elegance. Both panels on this well-preserved amphora are simple, yet
                    clear and bright, and enlivened with splashes of color ‚Äî in all, a most
                    agreeable decoration. On vases such as this one the grand manner that ultimately
                    derives from Exekias has been translated into the vernacular.</p>

                    without handles 27.7 cm. Broken and mended from various pieces; some plaster

                <p>This vase belongs to a sizeable category of Boeotian black-figure
                    lekanai decorated by a number of different painters (<bibl
                       ><title>AJA</title> 81 [1977] 55-65</bibl>).
                    These vases are predominately decorated in an animal style with creatures both
                    real and fantastic, though some display continuous floral designs. Human figures
                    are rare. The animal style, although originally Corinthian, was imitated by
                    Boeotian artists from Attic models. The Boeotian field ornaments, however, are
                    predominantly alien to these mainland styles and indicate a connection with East
                    Greek pottery ‚Äî particularly Fikellura ware (<bibl
                       ><title>AJA</title> 81 [1977] 64-65</bibl>).</p>
                <p><bibl>Ure (<title
                        >MMS</title> 4 [1932] 18-38</bibl>) divided these lekanai into two groups,
                    the first being slightly more refined and diversified and somewhat earlier than
                    the second. The choice and rendering of the subsidiary ornament on the Indiana
                    lekane would make it a transitional piece between the two groups.</p>
                <p>The Indiana lekane was decorated by the Minotaur Painter whose work
                    is known only by this vase and the name vase in Athens (<rs type="vase"
                       >Athens, NM 13919</rs>; <bibl>Ure,
                            <title>supra,</title> p. 28, no. 21 and figs.
                    21-22</bibl>). The tondo of the Athens lekane with the Minotaur without Theseus
                    is among the very rare examples in Greek black-figure vases of this depiction
                        (<bibl>Brommer 1973, 238 and 242</bibl>), and
                    further indicates the Painter's dependence on Attic formulae for inspiration.
                    The painter style of the Minotaur Painter, as exhibited on these two vases, is
                    relatively clean and displays a moderate taste for exactness which too often was
                    ignored by a number of his colleagues.</p>

                    Harlan E. Moore (70-8-I).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 11.0 cm; d. 28.3 cm.
                    Intact. Red ground outside, interior black with reserved medallion and line near
                    rim; handles black (mottled) with inner surface reserved; stem and upper foot
                    black, flange of foot reserved. Three wide, black bands and three thin lines
                    encircle base of bowl, the topmost serving as groundline of figures. The shape
                    is the black-figure cup type A with flaring shallow bowl, short thick stem,
                    fillet between stem and bowl, and flanged foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> On each side are two
                    large eyes with arching brows above, dots in the "forehead," and a snoutlike
                    nose with parallel lines above. The eyes have concentric circles of black,
                    white, and red with a black central disc. Around each handle is a trio of
                    fighting figures: a helmeted Athena and two giants are posed in a heraldic group
                    with the central figure crouched to fit beneath the handle. The two scenes are
                    almost identical save for details of costume. Athena and the standing giant,
                    erectly posed with feet wide apart, level spears at each other, while the
                    crouching giant's spear is lowered and his shield held up for protection.
                    Athena's flesh is white, now partly flaked off; her long undraped robe and a
                    scarf-like garment worn like a baldric, both have red decorations which differ
                    on the two sides. She wears her usual Attic helmet with a red fillet around it;
                    her extended left arm suggests that she might be holding a shield, but there is
                    no trace of it around the handle attachment. The giants are nude except for
                    their helmets and the red greaves of the standing figure, and both carry the
                    round hoplite shield with red and white decorative details. The standing giants
                    and one crouching giant wear the ordinary Corinthian helmet, while the helmet of
                    the fourth has three tall feather-like appendages instead of the normal plume.</p>
                <p>The interior medallion shows Triton, his fish-body closely coiled to
                    fit the restricted space. His long pointed beard is red, the other details are
                    incised (see <rs type="vase">Iowa City 1971.273</rs>).</p>
                <p>The closely spaced fighting groups contrast visually with the great
                    eyes which dominate the decoration. In the eyes the draftsmanship is good, with
                    clean, flowing lines, but the figure groups show more sketchy and sometimes
                    awkward work. The proportions of the arms with their tiny wrists detract from
                    the vigorous thrust of the spears, and the incised details are minimal and often
                    irregular. While the fighting groups are forceful, their poses are stylized.</p>
                <p>The potter and painter Exekias, who was a dominant figure in Attic
                    ceramic production from c. 550-525 B.C., may have invented the type A cup, which
                    seems to have begun about 530 and been the standard form for black-figure
                    painters during the last third of the century. The great eyes are also
                    associated with Exekias, the earliest example being on the exterior of the
                    famous Dionysos cup in Munich (<rs type="vase">Munich 2044</rs>;
                        <bibl>ABV, 146, no. 21</bibl>). While eyes
                    appear on earlier Greek vessels, they are a stylized version of the human eye,
                    while those on the type A cups (and occasionally on other black-figure shapes as
                    well) are quite distinct. The latter, with the long droplike extension on the
                    inner corner, imitate the Egyptian Eye of Horus, a powerful amuletic symbol in
                    that country and one which must have been familiar to Greek settlers and
                    mercenaries there. What significance it had for the Greeks we do not know, but
                    it may well have been apotropaic. The snoutlike nose, with parallel lines above
                    and dots in the forehead area, recalls the face of the Gorgon, which certainly
                    had an apotropaic function in Greece. The combination of these two potent
                    symbols from two countries is interesting; it occurs occasionally on other early
                    black-figure eye-cups but does not appear on eye-decorated vases of later date.</p>
                <p>The cosmic battle between the Olympian gods and the giants is a
                    common subject in Greek art. In relief sculpture, where the field is often
                    larger, most or all of the gods may be represented as in the Siphnian Treasury
                    at Delphi (approximately contemporary with the Krannert cup) and much later on
                    the Great Altar of Zeus at Pergamon. The restricted area of vases necessitated
                    an abbreviation of the theme, and Athena is the deity most commonly portrayed,
                    sometimes accompanied by Ares. In this cup, although the standing warrior is the
                    visual counterpart of Athena, he clearly menaces her with his spear and must
                    therefore be a second giant (see <rs type="vase">Madison
                    68.14.1</rs>, shoulder scene). The group of Athena fighting two giants, one
                    standing and one fallen, is found in the Siphnian Treasury frieze, and the cup
                    group may have been derived from it.</p>
                <p>Figure design confined to the handle area is not common in the
                    eye-cups; figures between the two eyes on either side are the normal placement.
                    However, the Krannert design is not without parallel.</p>
                <p>The inferior quality of the figure drawing prevents attribution of
                    the cup to Exekias himself since he was the finest draftsman of the black-figure
                    style, and the very small amount of incised detail also differs markedly from
                    the work of the master. However, since shape, eye design, and battle group show
                    definite Exekian influence, the cup was probably the work of a pupil or follower
                    of that painter. For the shape see <bibl>F.Villard,

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Figures and eyes:</hi> on each side, a similar
                    group of harpist (l.) and flautist (r.), facing. Their instruments and the
                    stools on which they sit are in faint dilute paint. The figures differ only in
                    that their hair-bags (sakkoi) on one side (A) are incised, on the other (B) are
                    plain. The apotropaic eyes, drawn with a compass, have black centers, with first
                    a red, then a black circle. The outer "eye," now almost entirely faded, is
                    white. The painter exceeded the limits of the outer "eye" in several places. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added red:</hi> "eyes" as mentioned; random dots on
                    women's garments, fillets, and top section of floral buds. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> eyes, daub on garment of each figure (not for
                    female flesh). <hi rend="ital">Tondo:</hi> Gorgoneion, whose teeth
                    are depicted as two rows of white dots with two pairs of slashes at each end for
                    incisors; large red dot for tongue (discolored).</p>
                <p>The shape of the cup is that of late black-figure and early
                    red-figure cups, similar to those made by Nikosthenes and his associates. The
                    decoration, however, is most unusual. The circle of rays above the foot,
                    alternating solid and reserved, and the Gorgoneion on the inside, are common
                    among black-figure cups, but the decoration on the two sides is unique. The
                    palmettes, the "ears" and the tendrils connecting them, and the eyes are
                    "Chalcidian" or "Chalcidizing," and the eyes themselves and the figures between
                    them are common on late black and early red-figure, "Chalcidian" and
                    "Chalcidizing" cups. The painter of the Milwaukee Cup was undoubtedly imitating
                    the decor of "Chalcidian" cups. The reserved band on which the decorations are
                    painted is like the bands on the Class of the Top-Band Stemlesses (<bibl
                       >Para., 100</bibl>) on which Boardman recently
                    commented (<bibl>Boardman 1974, 108 and fig.
                    184</bibl>). The Milwaukee Cup is, of course, not stemless.</p>
                <p>There exists a truly "Chalcidian" cup with an Attic foot (<bibl
                       >M√ºnzen, vol.34 [May 6, 1967], 48 no.
                    101</bibl>). The body with its long handles and its decoration is "Chalcidian"
                    but the foot is Nikosthenic, according to the catalogue where the close
                    connection between "Chalcidian" and Attic pottery is stressed and the priority
                    of the Attic eye-cup is emphasized.</p>
                <p>An even closer link between "Chalcidian" and Attic eye-cups is
                    provided by the "Chalcidizing Cups" (<bibl>ABV,
                        204-205</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 93</bibl>), one of
                    which is signed by the potter Pamphaios, another by Nikosthenes (<bibl
                       >Hoffmann, 358-359, no. 170</bibl>; <bibl
                       >G. R. Edwards, <title>What We
                            Don't Know</title> (1964) no. 55</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Boardman 1974, 107-108 and fig. 176</bibl>. "Another variant
                    which may have been devised in the Nikosthenes-Pamphaios workshop, to judge from
                    two signed specimens, is the Chalcidizing Cup. It seems to copy a type made by
                    Chalcidian potters in South Italy, and so represents a further observation by
                    this workshop of fashions in the western market. The decoration too sometimes
                    copies Chalcidian..." (Boardman).</p>
                <p>Boardman maintains that the "Chalcidian" pottery was made in Southern
                    Italy, possibly in Reggio, and L. H. Jeffery agrees with him (<bibl
                       >Jeffery 1976, 68</bibl>). However, E. Simon returns to the
                    assumption that the "Chalcidian" vases were made in Chalcis, on the island
                    Euboea, and she calls attention to the close ties between them and the Attic
                    vases (<bibl>Simon 1975b, 81-82</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Simon &amp; Hirmer 1976, 62-64</bibl>), but
                    she does not refer to the "Chalcidizing Cups" nor to the "Chalcidian" cup with
                    an Attic foot; D. A. Jackson does not advance the argument in his <bibl
                       ><title>East Greek Influence on
                            Attic Vases</title> (London 1976) 60-68, and 84</bibl>.</p>
                <p>The Milwaukee Cup is not a masterpiece; its painter was unable to
                    reproduce the elegant designs of the best "Chalcidian" cups, but he had before
                    his eyes a good model which he followed faithfully. Three of the four palmettes
                    have double ties between the volutes whereas the genuine "Chalcidian" cups have
                    normally single ties. The "ears" are not well copied from the "Satyr ears" of
                    the "Chalcidian Cups." Between the eyes are two figures, seated women, who make
                    music: in an unusual scene, one plays the harp, the other blows a double flute.</p>
                <p>The Milwaukee Cup is a significant link between "Chalcidian" and
                    Attic pottery. Together with the "Chalcidizing Cups" and the "Chalcidian" cup
                    with an Attic foot, it strengthens our conviction that "Chalcidian" pottery was
                    made in Chalcis, that is near Athens, but it does not yet prove that the
                    "Chalcidian" potters and painters belonged to a branch office of one of the
                    Attic potteries, that of Nikosthenes.<note n="‚Ä†" place="unspecified"

                    reserved with black-figured scene of two satyrs dancing around a palm tree. The
                    figures move outward with their heads turned back towards the center. The tree
                    and the satyrs are placed on a ground line; below are two drinking-horns with a
                    heart-shaped object between them. Careless incision was used for the satyrs'
                    faces and for some musculature. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi>
                    traces of white can be seen near the tails of both satyrs. Scattered dots of
                    white are preserved in the upper branches of the palm tree. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red:</hi> remains of a flat-red paint are preserved on
                    the beard and forehead hair of the right satyr.</p>
                <p>This is a typical example of a small number of cups which are
                    distinguished by undecorated exteriors and black-figured interiors. The interior
                    scenes are divided into "segments" (hence the name) usually including, as here,
                    a central scene with a lower area, or exergue. Other examples have a decorative
                    pattern forming an upper zone. In all cups, the scene covers the interior.</p>
                <p>Although mythological figures are found, the majority of the scenes
                    depicted on Segment Class cups show Dionysos and Dionysiac subjects.
                    Drinking-horns are often found in the exergue but occasionally a pair of large
                    eyes or other objects are shown. The amorphous object between the horns on this
                    example might belong to an unrealized pair of eyes, for it resembles the "nose"
                    which is often part of such a design. In general, the style of painting in most
                    of these cups must be considered as only fair in quality.</p>

                    numerous fragments and restored: much of the mouth is remade in plaster as is
                    the upper part of left handle and vase-body beneath left handle; some of the
                    neck on Side B is restored; over the entire surface of the vase, numerous cracks
                    and chips have been filled and repainted. Those patches affecting the design:
                    small portion of the upraised hand on Side A; several sections of the florals on
                    each side; on Side B, the helmet of the warrior in front of the car is
                    repainted, as is the patch on the horse's rump. The applied white on Side B has
                    been repainted: ball-device on shield, old man's tresses, women's faces. Details
                    on both sides of the vase seem to have been reincised. On Side A: Herakles'
                    nose, some curls in his hair, the line for his beard, and the fingers of Iolaos'
                    upraised hand seem fresh. On Side B, lines of incision seem to have been
                    strengthened following earlier designs. The applied red on Side B has been
                    enhanced considerably; the perimeter of the shield and the peplos of the woman
                    standing at the head of the team are entirely modern and other details in red
                    have been retouched, e.g. the tails of the horses. Two cherry-red lines beneath
                    picture panel run around the vase, blending into one band under Side B. A
                    purple-red line is above the floral bands, on each side, stopping at the
                    handles. There is a red-brown edge to the echinus foot; a line of similar color
                    at midpoint on the foot, another above the zone of 54 rays, and another on the
                    rim. Much of the lower part of the woman at the front of the team has been
                    redesigned; the woman's buttock, for instance, is painted with a greenish-black
                    substance which seems water soluble. The interior of the neck is glazed, and
                    here and elsewhere (Herakles' body, horses' forequarters etc.) the glaze is
                    mottled and streaky. Red-orange clay; underside of foot reserved with no
                    markings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Side A: Herakles
                    battles the Nemean lion. Herakles is on top of the lion, crushing the beast's
                    chest by using his own power. Suspended above are the hero's bow and quiver; to
                    the left is a bearded man running left but turning around to view the fray. This
                    is probably Iolaos, Herakles' nephew and sometime companion, who is frequently
                    depicted in scenes of this Herakles' first labor, carrying, as here, the hero's
                    club. He gestures wildly with his left hand, perhaps while shouting words of
                    encouragement (albeit through pouting, rather swollen lips). <hi rend="ital"

                    bearded charioteer in traditional robe who, curiously, wears a pointed traveling
                    hat. In front of the car, standing left, is a man with long white hair who has
                    turned around to speak to a woman directly behind. She wears the peplos, the old
                    man the chiton with himation. At her back is another warrior, like the previous,
                    wearing the tall-crested Corinthian-type helmet. Another warrior, carrying a
                    shield (device: balls), is at the head of the team, with a woman at his side.

                    to side. On side A there are 15, with a half unit at either end. Red dots
                    decorate the cuffs of the lotuses, the central petals of the lotus flowers, the
                    hearts of the palmette fans. The elements on Side B are similar, except in
                    number: 16 units, plus a half unit only at the left edge (B/A).</p>
                <p>The type and number of florals above the picture panels suggest the
                    period of the E Group, recall even some of the vases by the Painter of Berlin
                    1686 (type A amphora in London, <rs type="vase">London B 197</rs>:
                        <bibl>ABV, 296, no. 1</bibl>, and <bibl

                       >Champaign 70.9.3</rs>; <rs type="vase">Chicago
                        1978.114</rs>). The size and shape of the picture panels, as well, look
                    early. But the spare monumentality of the conception on Side A, with only one
                    accessory figure, the unusual mode of rendering the combat, with the lion's rear
                    legs both planted on the ground, militate strongly, as will be shown, against an
                    early date. These and other aspects are archaisms ‚Äî affectations much in
                    the spirit of The Affecter ‚Äî the work not of one black-figure mannerist
                    but, perhaps, of two; the panels are vastly different in composition and in some
                    particulars of style.</p>
                <p>The design on the side with Herakles is open, has more interplay of
                    solids and voids, and relies little on added color. Eyes are drawn carefully
                    with two large concentric circles, and good-sized, neat triangular ducts. And
                    circles abound elsewhere: "eyes" for the points of attachment of the straps to
                    the quiver, a circle (for a dimple) on the buttocks both of Herakles and his
                    nephew, on Iolaos' knees, for Herakles' nipple, for the upper part of the ears,
                    on the hero's abdomen and, of all places, a tiny circle on Herakles' testicle.
                    The curls of Herakles' hair and those for the beast's front paws are part of
                    this proclivity. Hatching on the bow and quiver, lines for the tuft at the tip
                    of the lion's tail further demonstrate this decorator's concern for rendering
                    textures and detail. On the reverse of the vase the air is more dense, the
                    people cheek-by-jowl, stepping on each other's feet. The welter of characters is
                    more typical of vases at mid-century and shortly thereafter (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, nos. 31 and 32</bibl>). On Side B the
                    eyes are beady, made of one small circle, loosely drawn, with an incised dot or
                    hook at the center; the ducts get no special attention. On this side, admittedly
                    the reverse, one misses that preoccupation with circles and curls. The
                    charioteer's head, nonetheless, in certain specifics, is similar to Iolaos' on
                    Side A: the fall of the hair on the nape of the neck, and the incised, wavy
                    hair-line continues to form the upper edge of the beard, meeting the nostril.
                    His ear is crudely drawn, fumbled, but, in plan, not unlike those of Herakles
                    and Iolaos-a continuous "S" shaped line, turning in on itself at the top.</p>
                <p>The design for the panel with Herakles and the Lion on this amphora
                    is especially close to the depiction of this labor on the obverse of an amphora
                    in a Swiss private collection (<bibl>ARV2, 3, no.
                    4</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 320, no. 4</bibl>; and <bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, pl. XXVIII.I</bibl>) which is by
                    the Andokides Painter. The "crouching" scheme for this combat (as opposed to the
                    "standing": see <rs type="vase">Chicago 1978.114</rs>) was better
                    suited to smaller spaces ‚Äî on the shoulders of hydriai or on the flaring
                    lips of amphorae (<bibl>Brommer 1973, A:a pp.
                        109-118; pp. 110-111, nos. 1-12</bibl>). Although this version appears
                    infrequently as panel decoration on amphorae, there are beautiful examples,
                    among them: on the obverse of an amphora type A by Psiax, now in Brescia (<bibl
                       >ABV, 292, no. 1</bibl>; <bibl

                       >Para., 127, no. 1</bibl>); on the obverse of an amphora of
                    similar shape painted by the Rycroft Painter (who is related to Psiax) in Paris
                        (<rs type="vase">Louvre F 215</rs>: <bibl

                       >Brommer 1973, 110, no. 2</bibl>); on the obverse of an
                    amphora type A also in Munich, painted by a member of the Leagros Group (<rs
                        type="vase">Munich 1414</rs>: <bibl
                        >ABV, 367, no. 87</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 162, no.

                    3</bibl>). Other depictions of the tale as well as these just mentioned, are
                    close either to the Andokides-Lysippides workshop or to the painters of the
                    Leagros Group, and all date near 520 B.C. The conspicuous lack of applied color
                    on the obverse of the Detroit vase also argues for a date after the invention of
                    red-figure.</p>
                <p>The lion as depicted on these amphorae, and on other vase-shapes as
                    well, conforms to a formula which has the beast standing on only one (almost
                    always the right) rear leg. Often, Herakles has grabbed the lion's left leg and
                    there are some instances when, with this leg, the beast claws and kicks the
                    hero's lowered head (<rs type="vase">Munich 1412</rs>: <hi
                        rend="ital">supra.</hi>) That both the beast's hind legs are
                    planted firmly on the ground, as one sees depicted on the obverse of this
                    amphora in Detroit and on the front of the red-figure amphora by the Andokides
                    Painter from the Swiss private collection (<hi rend="ital">supra:</hi>
                    <bibl>B. Cohen 1978, XXVIII</bibl>), seems rather
                    rare. That these two vases can be linked by their painters' interest in textures
                    is evident by a comparison of the snail-curls for Herakles' hair: the Detroit
                    hero has these designs incised, his counterpart on the Swiss vase has the curls
                    in relief. On a red-figure amphora in London, also assigned to the Andokides
                    Painter, Iolaos walks right but turns back to view the battle (<rs type="vase"
                       >London B 193</rs> Side A: <bibl
                        >ARV2, 4, no. 8</bibl>; <bibl>Para., 320, no.
                    8</bibl>; <bibl>B. Cohen 1978, XXXIV.2</bibl>); the
                    Nemean labor is very different here: Herakles has the lion completely off the
                    ground, overhead. But Iolaos' red beard, "S" shaped ear, and profile of the
                    buttock are not unlike his namesake on the Detroit amphora. Side A of a
                    fragmentary red-figure amphora type A by the painter now in the museum at
                    Leipzig (<rs type="vase">Leipzig inv. no. T 635</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 3, no. 3</bibl>; <bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, XXX.1-3</bibl>) also shows the Nemean labor.
                    Herakles' legs are in identical position to the Detroit scheme and the hero's
                    right leg overlaps and crowds Athena's in similar fashion; likewise, the quiver
                    hangs mysteriously above the contest. The fascination with circles, as evidenced
                    on the Detroit vase, can be seen on a red-figure amphora, again by The Andokides
                    Painter, <rs type="vase">Orvieto, Faina 64</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 3, no. 4</bibl>; <bibl>B.
                        Cohen 1978, XXXI.2</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Despite the number of similarities with the artistry of the great
                    Andokides Painter, apparently the inventor of the red-figure technique ca.
                    530-525 B.C., this does not imply that he himself painted the obverse of the
                    Detroit amphora; his art did not have to resort to mannerism for originality.
                    Someone close to him certainly painted the vase and there are decided echoes of
                    The Lysippides Painter, the close professional companion of The Andokides
                    Painter. An amphora type B at Pregny in the collection of Baron Edmond de
                    Rothschild may point the way for further research on this vase (for
                    illustration, <bibl>B. Cohen 1978, XIV. 2</bibl>;
                        <bibl>Para., 113, no. 12</bibl>; <bibl
                       >ABV, 255, no. 12</bibl>). The "crouching"
                    attitude of the combat nearly fills the entire panel on Side A. Although the
                    hind legs of the lion are not both on the ground there are many other features
                    which recommend comparison with the Detroit vase: the dimple on Herakles'
                    buttock; the arrangement of the bow juxtaposed on the quiver in mid-air above
                    the combat; the position of the lower strap and the markings on case and bow;
                    the configuration of Herakles' legs, notably his right thigh and lower leg, the
                    hero's curly hair and the kinds of incised strokes employed to achieve the hair,
                    the toothless lion with big eyes and dangling tongue, the general aversion to
                    applied color, Iolaos' hair-line, eye and ear, and the tuft on the beast's tail
                    are very close to similar details already discussed. The Detroit amphora must be
                    cleaned before more detailed efforts at attribution proceed; the starting point
                    for these efforts seems clear. For an amphora of similar shape and style which
                    is also attributed to the manner of the Lysippides Painter: <bibl

                    Apollo playing the kithara to two women, one on either side of him. Each woman
                    gestures to Apollo with outsized hands, as restored. They wear the peplos,
                    banded, and Apollos the himation. Their garments have decorated borders and, for
                    the woman on the left, the artist has added a dot-cluster to her peplos, near
                    the foot. These ladies, like the one on Side A, have a distinctive row of red
                    curls across the forehead. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> fillets

                <p>The painter was identified by Dietrich von Bothmer and recognized by
                    Beazley (<bibl>Para., 144, bottom</bibl>). Only two
                    vases, both neck-amphorae with distinctive features of potting, have formally
                    been assigned. Both amphorae are rather small and Beazley said of them in a
                    letter to the museum, "the shape is not quite ordinary, with its shortish neck,
                    reserved side of foot, and spreading handles. The patterns are nearly the same
                    in both, and the drawing of horses and people." The companion neck-amphora is at
                    Boston, <rs type="vase">Boston 76.40</rs> (<bibl
                       >Para., 144, no. 1</bibl>) and its shape was studied and
                    diagrammed long ago (<bibl>Caskey 1922, 46, no.
                    9</bibl>). The measurements of the vases are close ‚Äî 29.8 cm. h. and 20.2
                    cm. max. d. ‚Äî which demonstrates the control and skill of the Greek
                    potter. The Boston necker, as Beazley quipped, shows similarly on its obverse: a
                    youth and a man in a chariot, a warrior facing the chariot with an old man
                    behind and, finally, a second warrior standing at the head of the team. One sees
                    the same white horse, and the old man again carries a staff and has snowy hair.
                    On the reverse, a lusty scene, more interesting than Dayton's: Dionysos and
                    Ariadne stand under a cloak as one, on either side a satyr-surprisingly not
                    aroused-attacks a maenad. The satyr on the right has the woman stripped naked,
                    off the ground and into his arms; he moves toward a couch. The painter liked
                    added color; as a design, the naked woman is a vast area of white. The duo on
                    the left is amorously less far along. Dionysos' himation, like Apollo's on Side
                    B, is bordered at the bottom with waved incisions and Ariadne has the familiar
                    row of red curls.</p>
                <p>The florals are the same, vase to vase, as is, for the most part,
                    other subsidiary decoration; directly beneath the picture a band of meanders
                    (moving to the right), bounded above and below by a pair of thin lines; next a
                    row of plump lotus buds joined alternately top and bottom; under the lotuses
                    another row of meanders like the first, framed similarly; lastly, rays. There is
                    one difference in these schemes: the lotus bud chain on the Boston vase has an
                    additional series of dots in black glaze, one in each loop of the tendrils,
                    beneath the buds.</p>
                <p>Preceding his entries for the Dayton Painter in Paralipomena, Beazley
                    remarks, "the horses resemble those of the Euphiletos Painter," who himself
                    decorates a few atypical neck-amphorae (<bibl>ABV,
                        323, nos. 18-21</bibl>). The Euphiletos Painter also decorates two special
                    hydriai for the potter Pamphaios (<rs type="vase">Paris, Cab.
                        M√©d. 254</rs>: <bibl>ABV, 324, no.
                    38</bibl>; <rs type="vase">London B 300</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 324, no. 39</bibl>; for a vase signed by Pamphaios in
                    this exhibition, see <rs type="vase">Oberlin 67.61</rs>), who was a
                    younger companion of the potter Nikosthenes. Perhaps in this ambit the
                    Euphiletos Painter experimented with white ground, on the side of the mouth of a
                    good hydria in Munich (<rs type="vase">Munich 1703</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 324, no. 26</bibl>), which displays in its
                    main panel short wiry horses close in style to those on the obverses of the
                    Dayton Painter's neck-amphorae. <rs type="vase">Paris, Cab.
                        M√©d. 254</rs> (<hi rend="ital">supra:</hi>
                    <bibl>Hoppin 1924, 304</bibl>) is like these Dayton
                    Painter vases in another way; for a hydria it bears an unusual amount of
                    subsidiary decoration: wave patterns (rounded half dog-tooth) around the mouth,
                    dicing on the lower neck, dicing framing the shoulder panel at the sides, wave
                    patterns (rounded half dog-tooth) separating the panels, lotus and palmette
                    chains at the sides of the main panel and, under this panel, a band of meanders
                    running to the right, bounded top and bottom by a pair of thin lines.</p>

                    cm; d. of mouth 12.8 cm; d. of foot 10.7 cm. Intact and in excellent state of
                    preservation: small chips, some scuffing. Dark red slip; warm red-orange clay;
                    added color thickly applied and everywhere genuine. The decorator mistakenly
                    dripped added red on Hephaistos' lower right leg and ankle. The interior of
                    mouth and neck entirely glazed; the top of the lip is reserved. Red line at the
                    top of the neck and another half way down. The insides of the handles, lower
                    outer edge and underside of foot are reserved; raised fillet, painted red and
                    incised above and below, marks the junction of foot to vase body. Graffito on
                    the slope of foot consisting of a kappa and an epsilon, the middle bar of which
                    is extended considerably.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> return of Hephaistos. The god rides an
                    ithyphallic donkey, its member sporting a vessel; the donkey branded in five
                    places (for brands, see <rs type="vase">Minneapolis Inst.
                    57.1</rs>). Hephaistos wears an ivy wreath, is dressed in a chiton and a
                    himation which is banded with color and embroidered with dot-clusters; he
                    carries his familiar attribute in his right hand. He negotiates reins with his
                    left hand, not without pending difficulty as the beast rears its head and spits,
                    angered by its various burdens and taunted by the satyr behind who pulls its
                    tail. The satyr-by contrast not aroused-seems especially daemonic, teeth
                    showing, he, too, not pleased to bear the burden of an enormous volute krater,
                    which is decorated with swags of ivy. The satyr's tail is painted in dilute
                    glaze, the result of a single quick stroke of the decorator's brush. Dionysos
                    heads the procession, walks right but turns around to check the progress; like
                    his divine colleague he wears a wreath, chiton and decorated mantle. He holds
                    something in his hands, pressed against his body, a drinking cup no doubt. <hi

                    seconds: a Scythian at the left, an Amazon on the right. The painter pays
                    careful attention to detail: the <hi rend="ital">gorytos</hi> or
                    Persian quiver-bowcase filled with arrows and carried by the Scythian; the
                    Scythian's native dress, both the belted tricot made of skins, stitched at the
                    sides, and the soft hat; the combatants' baldrics and bandoleers and, on the
                    inside of the shield, the <hi rend="ital">porpax</hi> or arm-band
                    and the <hi rend="ital">antilabe</hi> or handgrip at the rim. The
                    warriors have greaves; curiously, each has one painted red the other black. The
                    warrior on the left wears an animal skin over a <hi rend="ital"
                        >chitoniskos;</hi> the other hero just wears the short chiton. These short
                    garments are decorated with bands and dot-clusters and are worn uncommonly long
                    in back. The Amazon wears an Athenian-type helmet, the warriors the Corinthian
                    model, both high-crested and low. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi>
                    Scythian's hair, beard, side flaps, and various panels on tricot; one greave for

                    cheekpiece and top of crest on Amazon's helmet, her bandoleer; eye of bucranium.

                    device, her flesh and the hilt of her sword.</p>
                <p>Alternate red and black tongue patterns at the base of neck; the
                    upper edge of the band of tongues is red and there is a slight raised fillet at
                    the base of the neck which is also red. In the floral chain on the neck: red for
                    the hearts of palmettes and a dot beneath the petals of lotuses. Under the
                    picture: a band of meander to the right, a pair of lines above and below;
                    lotus-bud chain connected, alternately, above and below with tendrils.</p>
                <p>The vase was attributed by Dietrich von Bothmer. Similar to Side B
                    are compositions on a neck-amphora of the same type and size in New York (<rs
                        type="vase">New York 61.11.16</rs>: <bibl
                       >Para., 141, middle, no. 6</bibl>). Aspects of drawing [mdash
                    ] the eyes of the women ‚Äî and the artist's enthusiasm for added color and
                    areas to which it is applied are close. On Side A Herakles battles Amazons and
                    on Side B there is another scene of combat. The Amazons at the ends of the
                    picture overlap the palmettes; the hilts of their swords are white and for an
                    emblem, the Amazon's shield has a bucranium, white with red eyes. A
                    quiver-bowcase is outlined, this time in red. The meander pattern under this
                    scene moves left. The added color is on the neck-amphora in London, the name
                    vase, which shows the story of Medea and the Ram (<rs type="vase"
                        >London B 221</rs>; <bibl>ABV, 321, no.
                    4</bibl>). The reverse of this vase, like another neck-amphora (<rs type="vase"
                       >London B 262</rs>: <bibl>ABV, 321,
                        no. 3</bibl>), displays a bawdy scene of men courting boys; the boy in the
                    center carries a large white rooster. The group was formulated by H.R.W. Smith
                        (<bibl>H.R.W. Smith 1945, 473</bibl>) who
                    studied a neck-amphora at San Simeon, now at New York (<rs type="vase"

                    scene of men courting women. Triton, on the obverse, has a white belly-stripe
                    and his caudal parts overlap the palmettes. For Scythians in vase-painting:

                            The shield device of one of the Amazons is not a bucranium (which is the

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 41.5 cm; d. 27.0 cm.
                    Complete; base has been broken off and replaced. Good condition; some mottling,
                    some fading of paint on Side B, small areas of paint flaked in various places.
                    Neck, top of rim, band below figure panel, lower body, line at base of foot
                    reserved. Red groundline below figures, borders of reserved band below panels,
                    in tongues and in details of figures; white in eyes and chiton of groom on side
                    A. Neck has addorsed palmettes with lotus buds between the open chain across
                    center. Tongue pattern, alternately red and black, separated by black lines on
                    upper shoulder; black rays on lower body.</p>
                <p>The well-shaped amphora has a gently rounding shoulder, a distinct
                    neck with a flaring, flat-topped rim, and simple handles extending from the neck
                    to the shoulder. The foot is flanged with a fillet connecting it to the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> On both sides the
                    figure design is restricted to the shoulder, and shows a man driving four horses
                    with a large Egyptian Eye of Horus on either side. The horses are in rapid
                    movement toward the right with all forelegs off the ground. The heads of the
                    trace horses are in profile facing right, while those of the yoke horses are
                    frontal, noses touching. The bodies are rather short and the legs
                    disproportionately thin. The paint density on the legs is irregular, showing
                    black blobs for fetlock and hoof with very dilute strokes connecting these
                    elements. Incised details on the bodies are also irregular, barely suggesting
                    the musculature; head details are sketchy. The manes were probably all
                    originally red, but much of the color has flaked away; long red tails stand out
                    behind the rumps. The profile heads show a cheekstrap and noseband; although
                    bridles extend from the open mouths, there is no trace of a bit. Breastbands,
                    originally red, appear on all four horses.</p>
                <p>Since the men's legs are not shown, each must be riding one of the
                    yoke horses. Both are beardless youths in short-sleeved chitons; on Side A the
                    chiton was originally white, now largely flaked away, while that on Side B is
                    black. The peaked and brimmed cap worn by the rider on Side B is unusual. Each
                    rider holds a long stick or goad in his right hand, while the left arm is
                    apparently stretched behind the horses, and the manner in which the four beasts
                    are controlled is obscure.</p>
                <p>The Horus eyes are identical in execution: black ground, incised
                    circle, black ring, white ring (now partly abraded), black center with dot. A
                    thin eyebrow curves over each eye.</p>
                <p>The execution is hasty with almost all the incisions rough and
                    irregular, and the frontal horse heads are particularly inept in drawing. The
                    unequal density of paint on the horses' legs has been mentioned, and it is
                    noticeable that both the applied red and white paint are usually flaked or
                    faded. The subsidiary designs are also blotchy and ill-drawn. However, the horse
                    groups are very lively and the idea of rapid motion is well-conveyed. The great
                    framing eyes make this a closed composition although the figure groups are open.
                    The spacing is fairly good with the focus clearly on the active central group.</p>
                <p>This type of neck amphora with a flaring rim is used from soon after
                    550 B.C. until the early fifth century; the elaborate neck ornament seen here is
                    characteristic for the form.</p>
                <p>Black-figure vases with design restricted to the shoulder are
                    uncommon, and most of those which have been preserved are combined with the
                    Horus eyes (see <rs type="vase">Champaign 70.8.1</rs>, for "eyes").
                    A group of such vases has been assigned by Beazley to "the Antimenes Painter and
                    his circle," and while the group has much in common, differences in detail
                    indicate different hands, and imprecise attribution is prudent. All show
                    mediocre draftsmanship with many of the same ineptitudes visible on the Krannert
                    amphora.</p>
                <p>The quadriga, or chariot, drawn by four horses, was used by the
                    Greeks for racing and apparently also in battle. The pose shown here, with trace
                    horses' heads in profile, facing in the same direction, and yoke horses' heads
                    frontal is believed to indicate a quadriga in the act of turning, a supposition
                    corroborated by the fact that the chariot wheels are usually shown as oval
                    rather than round in an attempt at foreshortening. However, the Krannert vase
                    shows no sign of a chariot on either side; this may be ineptitude on the part of
                    the artist, but might be intended to show the exercising or training of horses
                    rather than a race. If so, the subject would be a counterpart to the scenes of
                    athletes training in the gymnasium or palaestra. For similar amphorae with

                    32.8 cm; w. 41.0 cm; d. of foot 12.0 cm. Broken and repaired; small fragments
                    missing, including, in the tondo, most of the stone held by the centaur, part of
                    his tail and his front legs at their juncture with the chest; on Side B, an area
                    extending from the rim above the right eye across the eyebrow to the innermost
                    black band of the iris, and a few chips along a curved break extending from the
                    rim across the left eye and through the figure of the crouching trainer. <hi
                        rend="ital">Reserved:</hi> The inside of handles and between
                    the roots, and a narrow band on the inner and outer edges of the rim. The

                    of the stem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Interior</hi> (black-figure): A centaur with long
                    hair and beard rears to the right while he turns to look back to the left. His
                    torso is frontal, while his head is in profile facing left. In his extended
                    right arm he holds a boulder, now mostly lost. The remains of the incised
                    details of the upturned fingers of his right hand are visible to the left of the
                    boulder. Dilute glaze covers the boulder and the centaur's tail. In the field
                    behind the centaur is the inscription: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                        >[epig-rough]*O *P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign> ("the boy is beautiful").
                    Encircling the tondo is a plain black band with a reserved red band outside of
                    it. <hi rend="ital">Sides A</hi> and <hi rend="ital"
                    >B</hi> (red-figure): Athletic victor and trainer. On each side a single figure
                    between large eyes which are in turn flanked by palmettes with close-set petals
                    resembling large, open fans. On <hi rend="ital">Side A,</hi> a nude
                    youth wearing a wreath of victory stands facing right. He has a sash looped
                    around and hanging from his right arm and holds branches, incised in the black
                    background glaze. On <hi rend="ital">Side B</hi>, a youth wearing a
                    himation and wreath bends forward holding a marker in his lowered right hand.
                        <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> Wreaths and sash, and the
                    pupils of the large eyes. Relief contours appear on the large eyes, on the
                    tendrils of the palmettes and on both figures, except for their hair, which is
                    incised. Relief contours also for the large eyes and the tendrils of the
                    palmettes.</p>

                        Toledo 1, p. 46, fig. 9</bibl>. The cup has features of both Bloesch's Type
                    A (fillet between bowl and stem) and type B (convex profile of foot); on its
                    hybrid character cf. <bibl>M√ºnzen, infra, p.
                        66, no. 124</bibl>, and <bibl><title

                    39-40</bibl>; the palmettes have what he called the "late heart" ‚Äî black
                    except for a reserved dot in the middle. Prof. Cohen points out that here the
                    "late hearts" are unusual in that they are bounded above by only one relief
                    line, not two, as is the norm. The vase was attributed by Beazley: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 1630, no. 3 bis and 1621, no. 109
                    bis.</bibl></p>
                <p>The Bowdoin-Eye Painter, whose name-vase is a red-figure eye-cup in
                    the collection of the Bowdoin College Museum of Fine Arts (<rs type="vase"
                       >Bowdoin 1913.2</rs>: <bibl>ARV2,
                        48, no. 160 and 167, no. 5</bibl>), is one of the notables of the second
                    generation red-figure cup painters of the end of the sixth century. His work is
                    distinguished by careful and precise execution of ornament and balanced
                    compositions, but his treatment of the human figure is summary, lacking the fine
                    details of musculature and drapery seen in many of the works of his more
                    accomplished contemporaries.</p>
                <p>His figures, usually athletes, warriors or komasts, always appear
                    individually, whether on cup interiors or on exteriors between "eyes," or "eyes"
                    and palmettes (for the "eyes" see <bibl>Moon 1979,
                        no. 59</bibl> and <rs type="vase">Cleveland 76.89</rs>).</p>
                <p>Vases such as this one which are painted partly in the black-figure
                    technique and partly in the red-figure technique have been termed "bilingual"
                        (<bibl>Beazley 1928a, 25</bibl>). The interior
                    of this cup is painted in black-figure while the exterior is red-figure. The
                    painter's style in the black and red-figure techniques is distinctive and has
                    been discussed by Beth Cohen, (<bibl>B. Cohen 1978,
                        pp. 471-489</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Professor Cohen writes us that inscriptions such as the one on this
                    vase rarely appear on the tondi of early eye-cups; the preserved examples are
                    all potter-signatures (e.g. <rs type="vase">Bonn 390</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 41, no. 28</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >Paris, private collection</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 41, no. 25</bibl>). It is significant that <hi
                        rend="ital">kalos</hi> inscriptions occur only on late
                    bilinguals (e.g. <rs type="vase">Oxford 515</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 44, no. 85</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >Grasmere, Danson</rs>: <bibl>Para.,
                        325</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Vatican 499</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 169, no. 4</bibl>; <bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, pp. 474-475</bibl>). She also writes that a
                    centaur is an unusual motive for the black-figure tondo. Only three others on
                    eye-cup interiors are known to me (<rs type="vase">Villa
                    Giulia</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 42, no. 43</bibl>; <rs
                        type="vase">Naples, Astarita, 492</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 44, no. 81</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Oxford
                        1954.235</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 43, no. 66</bibl>).
                    On occasion, real animals and other hybrids also appear in this location (e.g.
                        <rs type="vase">Erlangen</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 42, no. 46</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Villa
                        Giulia 761</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 41, no. 22</bibl>).
                    The rather mannered pose of the Toledo centaur does not conform to the
                    traditional black-figure convention for rock-wielding beasts ‚Äî both
                    centaurs and Minotaurs; usually they hold a small stone in each hand and flail
                    their arms in almost a pinwheel motion (e.g. <rs type="vase"
                        >Vatican 499</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 45, no.
                    114</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Greenwich [Conn], Bareiss, 86</rs>, now
                    in the Getty Museum: <bibl>Para., 325</bibl>). The
                    profile of the Toledo centaur's face is not delineated with precision; such
                    debased profiles are characteristic of black figures by the Bowdoin-Eye Painter
                    (e.g. <rs type="vase">Copenhagen, Thorvaldsen Museum, 92</rs>:
                        <bibl>ARV2, 45, no. 108</bibl>). The Bowdoin-Eye
                    Painter grows progressively less fond of added color. Here no red is applied to
                    the centaur's hair and beard (cf. Centre Island, Bothmer: <bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, pp. 475-476</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The little figures between the eyes are drawn from the realm of
                    athletics ‚Äî an iconography popular for the red-figure exteriors of
                    bilinguals (e.g. <rs type="vase">Louvre F 126</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 43, no. 72</bibl>; <rs type="vase"

                        71, no. 12</bibl>). On the obverse an athlete displays his prizes: a wreath,
                    a fillet and some branches; this is the moment after his victory. The youth on
                    the reverse bends over while looking up ‚Äî a common pose for figures on
                    late eye-cups, both bilingual and entirely red-figure (e.g. <rs type="vase"
                       >Bowdoin 1913.2</rs>: <bibl>ARV2,
                        167, no. 5</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Amsterdam inv. 997</rs>:
                        <bibl>ARV2, 168, no. 1</bibl>; <bibl
                       >B. Cohen 1978, p. 482</bibl>). He may well be
                    the trainer of the athlete on the obverse. Perhaps he has just put aside his
                    wand in order to remove a marker from the playing field after the favorable
                    decision. The Bowdoin-Eye Painter's red figures are drawn with few inner
                    anatomical markings, his black figures with many more (cf. <rs type="vase"
                       >Stanford 70.10</rs>: <bibl>ARV2,
                        45, no. 109</bibl>; <bibl>B. Cohen 1978, p.
                    473</bibl>). Another feature of the drawing is characteristic of early
                    red-figure ‚Äî incision has been employed for details difficult to reserve:
                    hair contours and branches.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Cohen states: "The significant position in Attic
                    vase-painting occupied by the bilingual eye-cup was relatively short-lived. The
                    limited format was not sufficiently challenging for skilled vase-painters once
                    red-figure was no longer a novelty. The Bowdoin-Eye Painter was perhaps the last
                    cup-painter of some merit to decorate bilinguals."</p>
                <p>The interior of the bowl has an off-center, circular "ghost" of an
                    imprint which is most clearly visible in the black glaze upwards and to the left
                    of the tondo. This imprint is also noticeable in the tondo figure of the centaur
                    and can be followed across the tip of the centaur's tail just inside the plain
                    black band encircling the tondo, across the cannons of the centaur's back legs,
                    continuing across the juncture of the front legs with the chest, and upward
                    along the right side of the torso and across the right shoulder. The diameter of
                    this "ghost" imprint is 12.0 cm, exactly that of the foot of this cup. The width
                    of this imprint is equal to that of the width of the resting surface of the foot
                    of this cup. Evidently, the foot of another cup stood in its bowl during firing.
                    The Toledo cup may, in fact, have borne the weight of several cups stacked on
                    top of one another in this manner in the same firing, for the distinct lean of
                    the Toledo cup in the direction of the off-center circular imprint in its bowl
                    would indicate some weight pushing downwards on it during firing.</p>
                <p>The diameter of the reserved red resting surface of the foot of this
                    cup and that which stood in it during firing are also equal to the diameter of
                    the reserved red circle around the tondo. These specific unglazed parts were
                    carefully calculated to be of the same diameter so that during firing they could
                    be stacked, touching each other in this ingeniously contrived way so that no
                    trace of the stacking process would be visible after the cups were removed from
                    the kiln.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 10.9 cm; w. 35.5 cm;
                    d. at rim 28.2 cm; d. foot 10.6 cm. Mended from a few large fragments; applied
                    color rich and clear; some abrasion of glaze on handles. Clay is dark
                    red-orange. Resting surface of foot is reserved, inside of cone glazed. Inside
                    of handles reserved, so too the exterior edge of foot. Inner edge of lip has
                    thin reserved stripe and others, alternating with black, encircle the tondo
                    design. Three thin lines in dilute serve as groundline for the eye-figure scene
                    and three more are at the outer edge of the zone of rays. There are twenty rays
                    in outline, twenty in black; these alternate except in one place ‚Äî under
                    the left "eye" on Side A, where two outline rays appear side by side. A raised
                    fillet in reserve marks the join of the base to the bowl and beneath the fillet,
                    an incised line. Color of clay heightened by use of red wash.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Sides A and B</hi> are nearly identical: Between
                    "eyes," Athena strides left and brandishes her spear seemingly with her <hi
                        rend="ital">left</hi> hand; her shield (device on A: human leg
                    and thigh; on B: a snake) seems suspended in midair, obviously not held by the
                    warrior who approaches. Athena wears the high-crested Athenian helmet and
                    peplos, which is incised with stars. There are three loops in dilute glaze on
                    the goddess's back. Behind her goes Hermes, walking right but turning back, and
                    he wears the petasos and winged boots, chiton and chlamys. The angle of his
                    kerykeion, the staff, and the action of his holding it are not well rendered, on
                    either side of the vase. On Side B Hermes wears only the chlamys. On A and B, a
                    warrior, wearing Corinthian helmet, thorax, greaves and chitoniskos but without
                    other arms is accompanied by a child, and both seem to be supplicating the
                    goddess. The child, dressed in short chiton and chlamys, appears to be kneeling
                    on his right knee. Grape vines and bunches of grapes at the handles. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added red:</hi> perimeter of shields and second
                    ring and centers of eyes; stripe on wreathes of both helmets and for the brim of
                    Hermes' hat; Hermes' beard and stripes on chlamys. <hi rend="ital"
                        >Added white:</hi> shield devices, outer "eye," dots on warriors'
                    crest-bands; on Side A only, minuscule dots on Hermes' belt and in a band around
                    Hermes' neck; a patch covering thumb and index finger of warrior's right hand;
                    on Side B, the crown of Hermes' traveling hat. <hi rend="ital"
                        >Interior</hi>: Gorgon, <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi>
                    alternating rolls of hair on forehead, tongue.</p>
                <p>Figures now stand between the "eyes," and not grouped at the handles
                    (see <rs type="vase">Champaign 70.8.1</rs>), as was the case with
                    earlier "Exekian" eye-cups. This vase then represents a later stage in the
                    development of the eye-cup in Attica. Because the grape-vines are still neatly
                    confined to the handle area ‚Äî later they will invade the figural scene
                    ‚Äî and because of the design of the "eyes" themselves ‚Äî with
                    pointed tear gland and pointed upper, outer corners ‚Äî a date c. 520 or
                    very slightly earlier seems best. As Professor Beth Cohen informs us, this vase
                    nearly coincides with the earliest red-figure eye-cups which have pointed
                    corners (<rs type="vase">Florence 3 B 12</rs>: <bibl

                    29</bibl>), and most earlier eye-cups have compact tear glands (<rs type="vase"
                       >Vatican 498</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 43,
                        no. 74</bibl> and <rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L 468</rs>:

                       >B. Cohen 1978, pp. 260, 275, 280, and 306)</bibl>. The tear
                    gland on this Wisconsin cup is becoming attenuated, as will very much be the
                    case on the next generation of "eyes"; the outer upper corners, however, become
                    rounded, as one sees on the bilingual eye-cup at Toledo (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Toledo 1963.28</rs>). Rays decorate the area above the stem;
                    later these will be replaced by concentric bands.</p>
                <p>The Madison cup has a well-developed bowl, broad and shallow, which
                    sits on a stocky stem. It may very well have been potted in the Andokides
                    workshop which characteristically made a bowl with an expansive bottom which
                    begins to curve up gradually from the stem and then makes a sudden, sharp ascent
                    to the rim (<bibl>Bloesch 1940, 13-14</bibl>). The
                    Nikosthenic workshop also produced eye-cups which are often confused with those
                    of Andokides because each pottery imitated the other. But the latter most often
                    have a greater feeling of depth to the bowl and seem more rounded. The handles
                    of the Andokides group are set low to accentuate the gentle curve of the bowl.
                    The base of this cup has a rather thick foot-plate which flows into the stem in
                    an abrupt curve. This too is another characteristic of the Andokides workshop as
                    it produced this shape.</p>
                <p>The most confounding aspect of this cup at Madison is the
                    iconography. Though the warrior's body is protected with armor, he bears no
                    arms; his gesture with upraised left hand is better described as one of greeting
                    or entreaty and not one of threat. Likewise the child seems to be on bended
                    knee. Professor A. E. Raubitschek, informally, has provided us with
                    possibilities. The figure of Athena could very well be the Panathenaic Athena
                    Polias on the Acropolis of Athens (see <bibl>Moon
                        1979, no. 32</bibl>, <rs type="vase">Anonymous (Moon No.
                    32)</rs>), and he cites <bibl>Zanker 1965,
                    65-70</bibl>, where depictions such as the Athena on this cup are assumed to be
                    pictures of statues: "Could this be Ascanias and his father (without
                    grandfather) led by Hermes out of Troy ‚Äî by way of the Palladium?" For a
                    discussion of the appearance of the statue of Athena Polias on vases other than
                    Panathenaics: <bibl>von Bothmer 1952-1954, 52-56,
                        especially 55</bibl>. One notes that the Athena Polias on the Panathenaic
                    neck-amphora by the Princeton Painter at the Metropolitan Museum (<rs
                        type="vase">New York 53.11.1</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 298, no. 5</bibl>) has the same three loops at her back
                    as one sees on this eye-cup; the snakes' heads at the end of each loop are
                    clearly depicted on that vase. The artist on the Franks' cup abstracted these
                    and left out other features of the aegis.<note place="unspecified"

                    concave and reserved. The small eyes set high on the bowl and small palmettes
                    with reserved hearts place the cup in the Group of Leipzig 3599.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Tondo:</hi> palmette quatrefoil. Four palmettes
                    disposed along the coordinates established by the handles. The palmettes at
                    north and south, which point inward, each have nine fronds and hearts which are
                    peculiarly flat-ended because the volutes in which they sit do not touch. The
                    palmettes at east and west, pointing outward, each have eleven fronds and a
                    small drop in added red pointing from the volutes toward the center. The
                    tendrils run from one volute to the next, looping twice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Between eyes, a warrior
                    fallen to one knee; beyond each eye, a warrior. In each of the eyes, a red dot
                    covers the central compass point and rings of added red, added white, and glaze
                    surround the glaze pupil. The leftmost figure strides to the right wearing a
                    short chiton, corslet, and mantle whose elaborate ornamentation includes a
                    border of dots in glaze and added white. He has a helmet (red wreath), shield,
                    spear (reserved shaft and point), and greaves (red stripe indicating lining).
                    The central warrior has fallen to his left knee keeping his head and torso
                    frontal and extending his left, shield, arm. He is provided with a helmet,
                    shield, and greaves (red stripe for lining); the point of his spear is incised
                    while the shaft is rendered with the pinkish-brown clay matter which Psiax
                    habitually uses in addition to applied color. The abdomen shows an ambitious
                    attempt at rendering musculature. The figure at the right has a helmet, greaves
                    (red stripe for lining), spear (reserved shaft and point), and shield (device:
                    raven). Preliminary sketch lines appear for both this warrior and the first one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> Between eyes, a youth with
                    kithara; beyond each eye, a youth listening. The leftmost figure leans on a
                    staff and holds his right arm akimbo. He wears a himation and, like his two
                    companions, a wreath consisting of a red line with red and white dots on either
                    side. The flower in his left hand has two red sepals or petals within an incised
                    calyx. The kitharode, dressed in a long foldless garment underneath a mantle
                    with crenelated borders, clasps his instrument under his left arm and holds it
                    up by a strap around his left wrist. A cloth hangs from the left arm of the
                    kithara and the seven strings seem to be executed in the special clay matter.
                    The youth at the right corresponds to the one at the left in all essential
                    respects except that he is turned right, but faces back toward the center.

                <p>The cup in Cleveland, attributed by Beazley to Psiax, is one of six
                    preserved examples by the painter and one of two eye-cups, the other being <rs
                        type="vase">Munich 2587</rs> (<bibl
                        >ARV2, 7, no. 8</bibl>). The stylistic connection between them was
                    established by Beazley and recently has been discussed at some length (see
                    bibliography, especially <bibl>B. Cohen 1978</bibl>
                    and <bibl>Mertens 1979</bibl>). The exterior of the
                    Cleveland cup, however, still warrants brief consideration from an
                    iconographical viewpoint. The combination of a musical and martial subject
                    recurs in Psiax's oeuvre on the Munich cup where, however, the musical element
                    is limited to a flautist and a girl dancing between the eyes on Side B. The
                    representation on both cups is more genre-like and informal than either a
                    concert, with the performer on a bema, or a mythological gathering with a
                    lyre-bearing Herakles or Apollo. Psiax depicted the latter on his red-figure
                    amphora, <rs type="vase">Philadelphia MS5399</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 7, no. 3</bibl>), where Apollo stands
                    between the listening Leto and Artemis; on his bilingual <rs type="vase"
                       >Madrid 11008</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 7,
                        no. 2</bibl>), he supplemented the triad with a warrior, Ares. He has left
                    us other "informal" music-making scenes, all with flautists, in black-figure, as
                    seen on the Jameson lekythos (<bibl>ABV, 293, no.
                    11</bibl>), the plate <rs type="vase">Basel 421</rs> (<bibl
                       >ABV, 294, no. 21</bibl>), and a mastos in a
                    Swiss private collection. The Andokides Painter, who increasingly seems to
                    challenge the Antimenes Painter as Psiax's "brother," has left us two concert
                    scenes on red-figure amphorae: <rs type="vase">Louvre G 1</rs>,
                    with kitharode (<bibl>ARV2, 3, no. 2</bibl>) and <rs
                        type="vase">Swiss private</rs>, with flautist (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 3, no. 4</bibl>). These representations
                    are noteworthy because the refined young men with their beautiful garments,
                    flowers, and staves are cast in much the same mold as those of Psiax; moreover,
                    the reverse of <rs type="vase">Louvre G 1</rs> presents a combat.
                    The figures of Psiax, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from their
                    Andocidean counterparts in being more energetic and less frozen in their poses;
                    the studies of musculature on the Cleveland and Munich cups are significant in
                    this respect as well. Thus, while musicians appear on Attic vases from the
                    earliest black-figure (see <bibl>H. Gropengiesser,
                        "S√§nger und Sirenen," <title>AA</title> [1977]
                    582-610</bibl>), the informal performance is a genre subject that seems to
                    crystallize in early red-figure, and it makes one of its earliest appearances on
                    the Cleveland cup.</p>

                    24.7 cm; d. of base 15.5 cm; max. d. 29.7 cm, with handles 37.6 cm. Complete:
                    reconstituted from several large fragments; some minor plaster fill and some
                    very minor in-painting. Interior of neck and underside of lip well glazed;

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Main panel:</hi> frontal quadriga flanked by two
                    hoplites. A driver and warrior have already mounted the chariot whose horses
                    appear alert and anxious. The faces of two hoplites-like the chariot itself-are
                    shown frontally, a somewhat unusual feature at this time. The driver wears a
                    fashionable headband and long robe which is traditional for the profession; he
                    holds the reins and goad (kentron). The hoplite in the chariot carries two
                    lances-reminiscent of heroic times-and wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet as
                    does his companion standing to the right. The third wears the high-crested
                    version. The "spectator" hoplites wear baldrics for sword and quiver, and carry
                    lances and shields: device on the left a tripod, on the right, an octopus. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added red:</hi> chariot car, horses' manes and
                    tails, tops of greaves, fillets, various bands on helmet-crests, folds of
                    chitoniskoi, dot on shield of warrior on left; flair on bottom of breast plates
                    and dot in their upper center. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi>
                    charioteer's robe, shield emblems (now faded). <hi rend="ital"
                        >Shoulder:</hi> Theseus slaying the Cretan Minotaur with two youths and two
                    maidens looking on. Theseus, his sword in hand, holds the Minotaur at arm's
                    length; the monster defends himself with rocks. <hi rend="ital"
                        >Added red:</hi> hair of nude youths, stripes on maidens' peploi and on
                    Theseus' chiton and numerous dots on Minotaur's neck. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> women's flesh and Minotaur's rocks. <hi

                    animals and daubs on the haunch of the stag on the far right. A red band runs
                    around the vase beneath the predella, and the hearts of the palmettes at either
                    end of this little register are also red. Alternate red and black
                    tongue-patterns at the base of neck; double palmette-lotus-chains frame the main
                    panel on either side.</p>
                <p>This exceptionally well-preserved hydria is among the finest vases of
                    this painter who was named by Beazley after a love inscription on a hydria in
                    Leyden (<bibl>JHS 47 [1927] 63-92</bibl>; <bibl
                       >ABV, 266, no. 1</bibl>). Comparing aspects of
                    the rendition of the warriors here, especially their frontal pose, with the
                    warrior in the center of Side B on Psiax' red-figured eye-cup from the same
                    museum, also shown frontally, one can readily understand why the Antimenes
                    Painter was called by Beazley the "`Brother' of Psiax" (<bibl
                       >ABV, 266</bibl>, with additional bibliography). The hands of
                    the charioteer on this hydria, and the reins which he holds are beautifully
                    incised and the care given these details is possibly unexampled in his extant
                    vases. The human heads seen frontally are always rare in vase-painting and for
                    the Antimenes Painter only one parallel comes to mind, the charioteer on a neck
                    amphora from Vulci, now in the Royal Ontario Museum, <rs type="vase"
                       >Toronto 303</rs> (<bibl>ABV, 272,
                        no. 100</bibl>). In Attic vase-painting, perhaps the first painter to
                    experiment with frontal depictions of quadrigas was the Gorgon Painter (<rs
                        type="vase">Athens, Acr. 474</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 8, no. 2</bibl>), and in sculpture, contemporary with
                    this Cleveland hydria, the pediments of the temple of Apollo at Delphi show
                    Apollo, Artemis and Leto in frontal chariots. A vase by the Taleides Painter
                        (<rs type="vase">Louvre CP 10655</rs>: <bibl
                       >CVA, France Louvre 11, pl. 138.4</bibl>) in its composition
                    may be something by way of prototype for the shoulder scene on this hydria but
                    this is uncertain.</p>
                <p>Like many of his contemporaries at the end of the sixth century B.C.,
                    the Antimenes Painter was influenced by the revolutionary new style of the
                    red-figure vase-painters. Artists of this new style sought to depict human
                    beings in more realistic and active poses, often foreshortening and twisting
                    their bodies, and increasing their size and bulk. In addition to a few
                    practitioners experimenting with space such as we see on this hydria,
                    black-figure artists mostly responded to this impetus with increasingly more
                    complex treatment of detail. Here the various incisions, the unusually delicate
                    detail of the charioteer's hands, the more studied and faithful treatment of the
                    chariot box, and the larger human and equine forms crowding the limited space,
                    reflect these new red-figure innovations. Thus, the Cleveland hydria may
                    evidence a loosening of the Antimenes Painter's style, and an added interest in
                    filling space with unified, heavier compositions, which kept his black-figure
                    pottery desirable for a clientele with a taste for the old-fashioned in a period
                    of growing demand for red-figure.<note place="unspecified" anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Achilles and Ajax playing a board
                    game. The heroes are seated at a low, wide, gaming table, flanked by palm trees.
                    They are fully armed, but apparently at rest: each carries a spear in his left
                    hand and has slung his shield over his left shoulder. Both wear Corinthian
                    helmets, perched on top of their heads like hats; Achilles' helmet has a high
                    crest, Ajax's a low one. Both heroes are mature bearded men. Achilles wears a
                    short chiton, a chlamys and greaves. Ajax's body is mostly obscured by his
                    Boeotian shield, its device a frontal panther's head between snakes. Achilles is
                    about to make a move with his carefully poised right hand; Ajax gestures, his
                    right hand extended, palm toward the viewer. Athena stands at center, behind the
                    gaming table, her presence not noted by the players. Her upper torso is in front
                    view and her legs turn right, but the goddess looks around towards the left. She
                    wields a spear in her right hand and gestures with her raised left hand to warn
                    the players of the approaching enemy. Athena wears an Attic helmet, and a
                    chiton, topped by an aegis bearing a large gorgoneion. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B:</hi> athletes and their trainers. To the right of
                    center a musician (r.) plays the double flute <hi rend="ital"
                        >(aulus)</hi>. At the far left stands a trainer (r.); an athlete (l.)
                    carrying three javelins in his left hand, walks toward him, but turns back to
                    look at the other figures. An acontist (r.) rushes toward the center as he
                    throws his javelin. On the far fight, an athlete (l.) prepares to jump with
                    weights <hi rend="ital">(halteres)</hi>, and a trainer (l.) turns
                    back to look at him. The musician wears a long white robe and a wreath on his
                    head. The trainers wear himatia and carry staffs. The hair of the trainer on the
                    left, as well as that of each athlete, is bound by a fillet. The left-hand
                    trainer is a youth. The raised arm of the acontist obscures the lower part of
                    his face. All other figures are bearded. <hi rend="ital">At the
                        handles:</hi> grape vines. A vine of ivy encircles the exterior below the
                    rim, and a tongue pattern encircles the lower part of the body. Interior glazed
                    black save for reserved stripe near rim. <hi rend="ital">Added
                    red:</hi> interior of Achilles' shield, fold of fabric at his waist, pattern on

                    borders of chiton of Athena and of himation of mature trainer, most beards,
                    fillets, inscriptions, stem of ivy pattern and alternate tongues. <hi

                    shield device, base of gaming table, Athena's flesh and her gorgoneion,
                    musician's robe.</p>
                <p>This impressive pot, large in size and sturdy in shape, was well
                    designed for its function. The ancient Greeks diluted their strong wine so that
                    its aroma and consistency became suitable for drinking. Kraters generally served
                    as mixing bowls for cutting wine with water. Occasionally, when filled with snow
                    or ice water they became wine coolers‚Äîreceptacles for smaller vases,
                    psykters (see <rs type="vase">Bloomington 75.102.1</rs>), which
                    contained the ready-to-drink liquid (this use is illustrated on a fragment by
                    Oltos, <rs type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.64</rs>).</p>
                <p>The body of the Toledo krater has a cup-shaped bottom from which the
                    walls of the vase rise, slowly spreading outward toward the top. In form it is
                    like the calyx of a flower; hence derives the name by which the shape is now
                    known. The master painter and potter Exekias is credited with the invention of
                    this type of krater. Around 520 B.C. he decorated the earliest preserved
                    example, found on the North Slope of the Athenian Acropolis (<bibl
                       >ABV, 145, no. 19</bibl>; <bibl>O.
                        Broneer, "A Calyx-krater by Exekias," <title
                        >Hesperia</title> 6 [1937] 469-486</bibl>).The calyx-krater was a late comer
                    to the repertory of black-figure workshops. The Toledo vase is the only
                    black-figured calyx-krater in a Midwestern collection. Its careful artist, the
                    Rycroft Painter, appears to have worked solely in black-figure, but Beazley
                    considered him "related to Psiax" (<bibl>ABV,
                    335</bibl>) and an early experimenter with red-figure.</p>
                <p>The Rycroft Painter's calyx-krater departs from the ornamental scheme
                    of Exekias' North Slope vase. A vine of ivy appears in the reserved band below
                    the rim, instead of a palmette-lotus-chain. A tongue pattern replaces Exekian
                    rays. The cul (convex-curved lower zone is plain‚Äîpainted black; on
                    Exekias' calyx-krater it is decorated with a figurative predella. Significantly,
                    this alternative black-figure scheme (cf. <rs type="vase">Brussels
                        R 310</rs>: <bibl>ABV, 281, no. 17</bibl>)‚Äî
                    ivy, tongues and plain black cul‚Äîrecurs on the earliest known
                    red-figured calyx-kraters (in the Villa Giulia: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 77, no. 90</bibl>, and the Louvre, <rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre CA 5950</rs>: <bibl>B. Cohen
                        1978, p. 402 and no. 9</bibl>). The Rycroft Painter has retained one Exekian
                    feature‚Äîgrape vines over the handles‚Äîa reference to the function
                    of the pot. This motive, standard for black-figured calyx-kraters (e.g. <rs
                        type="vase">Vienna 3618</rs>: <bibl
                        >ABV, 280, no. 56</bibl>; Volos: <bibl>ABV, 148,
                        no. 9</bibl>), also appears on the very first red-figured examples <hi
                        rend="ital">(supra)</hi>. In red-figure, the calyx-krater is a
                    dark vase with light decoration; the Exekian black-figure type is light with
                    dark decoration. The Toledo calyx-krater comes between the two; it is partly a
                    light vase and partly a dark vase.</p>
                <p>The depiction on the obverse recalls another famous prototype by
                    Exekias (cf. <rs type="vase">Vatican 344</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 145, no. 13</bibl>). "The story...is not recorded in
                    extant literature, and our knowledge of it is gathered from works of art alone,
                    chiefly vases...one day at Troy the two chief champions of the Greeks, Achilles
                    and Ajax, became so absorbed in their board-game that they did not hear the
                    alarm, and before they looked up the Trojans were in the Achaean camp," (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1951, 65</bibl>). This theme is popular
                    in late black-figure, less so in early red-figure (<bibl
                       >Brommer 1973, 334-339</bibl>). The austere Exekian
                    composition is commonly augmented. Athena frequently makes an appearance (e.g.
                        <rs type="vase">London 93.7-12.11</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 397, no. 28</bibl>; <rs type="vase">London
                        E 160</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 222, no. 19</bibl>);
                    here she stands behind the playing board (cf. <rs type="vase"
                        >Karlsruhe B 2</rs>: <bibl>ABV, 492, no.
                    73</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Aberdeen 744</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 73, no. 28</bibl>). The Rycroft Painter was fond of the
                    palm tree‚Äîa fine specimen appears on his namepiece, an amphora once in
                    the Rycroft Collection (<rs type="vase">Oxford 1965.118</rs>: <bibl
                       >ABV, 335, no. 1</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Para., 148</bibl>). The pair flanking the Toledo heroes
                    adapts the episode to fill the broad, flaring picture field of the krater. This
                    scenic element may well have been first associated with this composition in this
                    example (cf. <rs type="vase">Louvre MNB 911</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 301, no. 1</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >London E 10</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 90,
                        no. 33</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Columbia, S.C.</rs>: <bibl

                       >Schefold 1978, p. 249</bibl>). Kurt Luckner points out that
                    the Rycroft Painter has given five pairs of lateral fronds to the palm tree near
                    the great hero Achilles, but only four to the palm near Ajax. In Exekian
                    tradition, shields flank the players. Here the seated figure tradition sets are
                    dispensed with‚Äîthe heroes crouch with their shields, ready to spring up
                    and fight at a moment's notice (e.g. <rs type="vase">Aberdeen
                    744</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 73, no. 28</bibl>; <rs
                        type="vase">Florence 3929</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 460, no. 15</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The names of the characters in the gaming scene are inscribed.
                    Written notation of which player is which hero is not common (<bibl
                       >CVA, USA 17, Toledo 1, p. 11</bibl>). Even more unusual is
                    the red color of all the inscriptions. Normally, in black-figure, inscriptions
                    are in black glaze; red was generally employed for writing on the black
                    backgrounds of red-figured vases (<bibl>B. Cohen
                        1978, pp. 211-212, 407-409</bibl>). Its red inscriptions alone mark the
                    Toledo calyx-krater as a black-figured vase from the red-figure period.<note

                    splendid depictions of athletes and their trainers by both Euphronios and the
                    Kleophrades Painter have come down to us on somewhat later vases of this shape
                    (cf. <rs type="vase">Berlin F 2180</rs>: <bibl

                    youths and boys; it is noteworthy that most of the participants in the Rycroft
                    Painter's black-figure athletic scene are mature bearded men. The artist of this
                    vase belongs to the old guard.</p>

                    chariots, making up twelve iconographical groups. The characters are placed
                    around the circumference of the rim, without interruption, creating a continuous
                    frieze of six quadrigae repeatedly enclosing Greek warriors and mythological
                    heroes. Highlights of this entourage include Theseus slaying the Minotaur,
                    flanked by an Athenian youth and maiden (Group 1). The bearded Herakles clutches
                    the neck of a centaur, probably Nessos, who holds a stone in one hand and
                    attempts to hold back Herakles with the other. The centaur falls to the ground
                    as Herakles strikes the final blow with his sword (Group 3). Warriors with
                    lances raised and shields in position (Group 5), fight over the body of a dead
                    comrade (possibly the Trojan War heroes Menelaus and Hektor, with the dead
                    Euphorbos). The vestiges of a sunburst shield device are still visible on the
                    second warrior's Boeotian shield. The combat is flanked by two women. Further
                    along, the bearded Herakles wrestles with the Nemean lion while Iolaos holds the
                    hero's club and bow and Athena and Hermes watch (Group 9). Between these scenes,
                    bearded men (Groups 2, 6, 10, 12) and epheboi (4, 8), wearing lightweight
                    Boeotian shields, drive quadrigae while men (4) and women (2, 4, 8) bid them
                    farewell and warriors (6, 10, 12) prepare to depart. Two groups of soldiers
                    actively engage in battle (7, 11). Two warriors, one wearing a Corinthian helmet
                    and a shield emblazoned with pellets, have forced an opponent, in an Athenian
                    helmet, to his knees (7). The other groups of soldiers, in a conventional pose,
                    charge violently at each other (11). <hi rend="ital">Added

                <p>On the interior rim, five ships move in full sail to the right (see
                        <rs type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.141</rs>). The
                    prow of each ship is in the form of a boar's head. The nose is rounded, the
                    mouth, eye, and ear sharply incised. Two pairs of arcs mark the cathead, the
                    location of cross-timbers which projected from either side of the bow and were
                    used as a support to lift the anchor. A single wale line and a pair of lines
                    defining the gunwale are incised from stem to stern above these arcs. The hull
                    is painted purple. The oarsmen's heads have not been delineated, and the oars
                    have been quickly incised. The helmsman, the only figure carefully incised, sits
                    in the stern compartment or poop deck. The stern behind him is topped by a
                    swan's head. The mast (applied white) in full sail shows brailing ropes and
                    halyards on the windward side.</p>
                <p>The scenes on the exterior and interior of the dinos, thus described,
                    represent separate stock motifs employed and rearranged by many artists for
                    dinoi in the late sixth century B.C. (For lists of dinoi displaying figured
                    scenes and battleships see <bibl>Morrison &amp;
                        Williams 1968</bibl>; <bibl>Schauenburg 1970,
                        34)</bibl>. Both the many scenes depicting departing warriors and the
                    battleships decorating the interior rim may be from the repertory of Trojan War
                    motifs.</p>
                <p>Representations of ships on Greek pottery occur as early as the
                    eighth century. The particular kind of ship depicted on the Cleveland dinos is
                    sometimes called "Samian" (<bibl>C. Torr, <title
                           >Ancient Ships,</title> [Chicago 1964] 65</bibl>, and

                        Dinos," Art in America 29 [1941] 215-216</bibl>) and appears in a primitive
                    form on the Fran√ßois Vase (c. 570 B.C.). The placement of the battleship
                    is as common as it is clever, for when the dinos is filled with water and wine,
                    the ships seem to float on the "wine dark sea."<note place="unspecified"

                <p>The technique and style of Exekias, the master black-figure artist
                    toward the end of the sixth century, strongly influenced the Antimenes Painter
                    and his colleagues. A fragment of a black-figure dinos at the University of
                    Chicago, within the Exekian Group of dinoi, helps establish this debt (see <rs
                        type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.141</rs>). Of the
                    two dinoi attributed to the Antimenes Painter, one (in Madrid) has the same
                    shape as the Cleveland example (<rs type="vase">Madrid 10902</rs>,
                    from Akragas, c. 520 B.C.; <bibl>ABV, 275, no.
                    133</bibl>; <bibl>Morrison &amp; Williams 1968,
                        pp. 102-103, pl. 17a</bibl>; see further, <bibl
                        >Kathman, <title>infra,</title> n. 30</bibl>). An
                    examination of the figural scene on the Madrid dinos illustrates Exekias'
                    influence. Like the master Exekias, the Antimenes Painter placed his figures and
                    separate scenes neatly around the rim creating the appearance of a continuous
                    frieze. The scenes include typically Exekian components: exotic Scythian
                    archers, chariots ready for departure, warriors in combat, seated attendants,
                    and various mythological characters. The frieze is characterized by extremely
                    delicate incision and many added details rarely found on contemporary vases.</p>
                <p>The figural scene on the Cleveland dinos is close to the Madrid
                    example, but it is not by the same hand. The painter of the Cleveland dinos,
                    while technically proficient, lacks the sureness of touch seen on the Madrid
                    dinos. The figures are equally well-placed around the rim allowing an easy flow
                    from one scene to another, but in the Cleveland example two features of the
                    Exekian prototypes-the exotic elements and the seated figures-are missing.</p>
                <p>Exekias may have been the first to paint the interior rim of a dinos
                    with ships. Only technical details differentiate the battleships of Exekias from
                    those of other painters such as the Antimenes Painters and his Circle (<bibl
                       >Kathman, <title>infra,</title>
                        nn. 31 and 33</bibl>). An examination of such drafting details reveals that
                    the Antimenes Painter remained close to his predecessor, while his followers
                    loosely interpreted the compositions of the masters. Although all the
                    distinctive features are too numerous to mention, a number of prominent drafting
                    peculiarities are readily noticed. In translating the designs of his
                    predecessors the painter of the Cleveland dinos added novel details that may
                    have set the style for later artists (<bibl>Kathman,
                            <title>infra,</title> n. 34</bibl> for extensive
                    discussion).</p>
                <p>Numerous technical features (retention of figural formulae, uniform
                    spacing of figures, depiction of battleships with a low, thin form) suggest that
                    of all the painters within the Circle of the Antimenes Painter, the artist of
                    the Cleveland dinos is closest to the master. He employs with skill and
                    inventiveness the Exekian traditions that influenced the Antimenes Painter and
                    were filtering through the workshops of this period. The Antimenean spirit that
                    suffuses this vase indicates a close working relationship between this artist
                    and the master, and suggests that the Cleveland dinos was made during the
                    Antimenes Painter's own productive years, perhaps around 520-515 B.C.</p>

                    d. 26.8 cm; d. of mouth 14.6 cm. The psykter is assembled from many fragments
                    with much missing. The lower part of the stem and the entire foot are restored
                    in plaster.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The subject is a
                    Dionysiac thiasos. Dionysos is mounting a quadriga, holding the reins with both
                    hands. An ithyphallic satyr faces him and raises a kantharos to his lips. Behind
                    him a maenad with krotala dances to right, looking round. At the head of the
                    cortege, Hermes advances to right, also looking round. He is preceded by a satyr
                    playing the flutes and another one moving to right, looking back. Behind the
                    chariot a satyr, carrying a full wineskin on his left shoulder, follows on foot.
                    He looks round at three pairs of satyrs and maenads: the pair closest to him is
                    dancing, the one in the middle is shown in an embrace, and the farthest one,
                    again dancing, moves in the opposite direction. Although the scene is
                    continuous, the three pairs can be called the reverse. It is also not without
                    significance that there are no vines in the background and that the satyrs are
                    not ithyphallic.</p>

                    Dionysos' hair, beard of Dionysos (but not his hair); satyrs' beards (but not

                    manes and breastbands in thin lines; occasional fine stripes on garments;
                    alternate elements in tongue-pattern. <hi rend="ital">Added

                <p>The lip is decorated by an ivy wreath that has an undulating red
                    vine.</p>
                <p>An attribution to the Rycroft Painter is borne out by the figure of
                    Hermes that is very close to the Hermes on <rs type="vase">Boston

                    appears on the amphora in Vienna (<bibl>ABV, 335,
                        no. 4</bibl>). In the latter he holds the reins and his kantharos; here it
                    looks as if he has given the kantharos to the satyr, who ‚Äî and this is
                    unusual ‚Äî drinks from it.</p>
                <p>The ivy on the rim is close to the ivy on the mouth of the Rycroft

                    ivy wreath but with corymbs between the leaves. Here the foot of the psykter is
                    in two degrees, and I suspect that the missing foot of the Bloomington psykter
                    should not have been restored as a torus.</p>

                    from the right), wreathed and beardless, reclines on his couch. His himation is
                    draped loosely around his legs and waist, and he holds a phiale in his extended
                    right hand. Priam, in the center of the scene, wears a chiton and himation and
                    strides towards Achilles, his arms extended imploringly. Hektor's nude corpse
                    lies on the ground in front of Achilles' couch and food-laden serving table. To
                    the left of Priam is a youth who carries the ransom goods: a tripod and three
                    stacked phialai. He wears a short chiton and grasps a leg of the tripod with
                    each hand and carries it with the cauldron above his head. The phialai rest in
                    the crook of his right arm. The upper two are incised with loops (as is
                    Achilles'), the lowest one with simple curved strokes. Hermes, wearing a winged
                    pilos, a chlamys and boots, stands at the far left, holding the kerykeion in his
                    right hand. At the far right stands a serving girl wearing a chiton and himation
                    and holding a hydria. She moves left towards the center, the hydria is another
                    part of the ransom. Hektor's corpse lies on its back, the legs bent at the
                    knees. His left hand is drawn as if it were a right hand (as is Achilles' left
                    hand). His right arm is shown resting on his body and thigh. Priam's legs are
                    drawn in front of Hektor's body, but his left hand is on the far side of
                    Achilles' right shoulder. On the wall behind Achilles hangs a high-crested
                    Corinthian helmet, a sword in its scabbard and a round shield. A pair of spears
                    leans against the wall to the right of the shield. Achilles reclines on a thick
                    mattress, with a pillow at his back. For the inscription in the field, cf. <bibl

                    hands and in his left hand a goad as well. He wears a long robe and a nebris,
                    and a Boeotian shield hangs at his back. A warrior, second from the left, stands
                    on the far side of the chariot and faces the charioteer. He wears a low-crested
                    Corinthian helmet and greaves, and carries a round shield (the device on which
                    is a lion protome) and a spear. Next to the warrior is an old man who wears a
                    chiton and himation. He looks anxiously towards another warrior who stands
                    behind the horses and moves to the right, but looks back to the left at the old
                    man. He wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet, a short chiton, greaves and
                    carries a Boeotian shield and a pair of spears. At the far right stands a third

                <p>The Rycroft Painter, so-called after a type A amphora (like the
                    Toledo amphora) once in the Rycroft collection, the Spencer-Churchill collection
                    and now in the Ashmolean Museum, <rs type="vase">Oxford
                    1965.118</rs>, is a member of the old guard, choosing the tradition of
                    black-figure over the newly-developed red-figure technique. However, his work is
                    not unaffected by his contemporaries in red-figure, as seen, for example, in the
                    incised outlining of his figures. Beazley relates the Rycroft Painter to the
                    Priam Painter (see <rs type="vase">Madison 68.14.1</rs>, <rs
                        type="vase">Toledo 1961.23</rs>, in the same collection) and to
                    Psiax (<bibl>ABV, 292-294</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The main panel (Side A) illustrates a well-known scene from Homer's
                        <hi rend="ital">Iliad</hi> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.468"
                       >Hom. Il. 11.468-670</bibl>) wherein the aged
                    Priam, King of Troy, goes to the enemy camp to plead with the Greek hero,
                    Achilles, for the body of Hector, Priam's son, whom Achilles had killed in
                    battle. Among Greek vases depicting the ransom of Hector, the Toledo amphora is
                    remarkable for the intense emotion expressed in the plaintive figure of Priam
                    and for the attention focused on the pitiful figure of this bereaved king. For

                <p>The Rycroft Painter's work has two distinguishing quirks which can be
                    seen on the Toledo amphora: the rendering of left hands as right (<hi

                    see also <bibl>M. Robertson, <title

                    reverse as seen here on the figures of Achilles on Side A and the helmeted
                    warrior (second from the left) on Side B.</p>

                    <hi rend="ital">Main Panel:</hi> the departure of Herakles for
                    Olympos. Athena on the far left steps into her chariot which will take Herakles,
                    standing before the car, to his reward of immortality on the sacred Mount.
                    Athena wears her aegis, a high-crested Athenian helmet, and chiton, and holds a
                    kentron or goad in her right hand. Herakles with a quiver of arrows on his back,
                    a club in left hand and lion-scalp on his head, gestures to Hermes who is the
                    guide on the journey. Hermes is dressed in a heavy chlamys or cloak, a chiton,
                    winged boots and the petasos or traveling hat; he has turned around toward
                    Herakles and he, too, carries a goad. A female attendant, dressed in chiton and
                    himation, stands quieting the team of horses, which largely hides her from view;
                    her hair is bound with a fillet and has a long feather in the back. <hi

                    and a stripe on the side of her car; Herakles' forelock and beard; the brim of
                    Hermes' hat, a decorative border on his tunic, and his winged boots; tails of
                    the horses. <hi rend="ital">Added white</hi>: parts of female

                    in three-quarter view; another chariot, similar, is driven by a male in
                    Corinthian panoply, who may be Ares. Both chariots converge on a fleeing giant,
                    possibly Enkelados (see <rs type="vase">Cleveland 78.59</rs>). <hi

                    meanders to the right, and bands of ivy frame the panel on either side; a zone
                    of alternating red and black tongues is above the shoulder scene. A raised red
                    fillet separates the base from the vase proper; two red lines run completely
                    around the vase beneath the main picture, another is above the zone of rays, and
                    the rotelles on either side of the pouring-handle are red. Graffito on the
                    underside of base: <foreign xml:lang="greek">V H</foreign>.</p>
                <p>The Priam Painter prefers, for the design of his horses, broad areas
                    of silhouette with no interior markings; this peculiarity reminds one of some
                    early red-figure painters of the time such as Oltos, Epeleios and the
                    Bowdoin-Eye Painter. On occasion, the Priam Painter outlines part of his
                    silhouettes with incision ‚Äî e.g. the crouper of the furthest horse,
                    Herakles' right arm, part of the attendant's garment etc. ‚Äî to achieve
                    added separation of the figure from the background, possibly in imitation of
                    certain relief contour lines from red-figure painting. His interest in
                    foreshortening also shows the influence of the new, more popular technique.
                    Judging his production as a whole, the designs on some of his hydriai show
                    kinship to the Leagros Group (Civitavecchia-Munich, <bibl
                       >ABV, 332, no. 22</bibl> compared to the Leagros hydria from
                        <rs type="vase">Toledo 1969.371</rs>, <bibl
                       >CVA, USA 17, Toledo 1, pls. 25-26</bibl>). His neck-amphorae
                    occasionally seem near the Antimenes Painter. On the Madison vase the trim
                    "lady-like" horses, the well-proportioned figures and the sensitive handling of
                    Athena's chiton are closer to the latter. On the other hand such Gigantomachies
                    as we have on the shoulder of this vase, with Athena's chariot in vigorous
                    three-quarter view, date to the Leagran period and are largely painted in
                    black-figure by members of the Group. The second balancing chariot is rare. The
                    association of its members and the working relationships of these two important
                    workshops are intriguing problems in ancient painting and have yet to be
                    explored in detail. The work of the Priam Painter and perhaps of the Rycroft
                    Painter (see <rs type="vase">Toledo 1963.26</rs>, <rs type="vase"
                       >Bloomington 75.102.1</rs>, <rs type="vase">Toledo
                        1972.54</rs>) will shed some light. The subsidiary decoration on this vase
                    is similar to that on two other vases by the Priam Painter: <rs type="vase"

                    <hi rend="ital">Main scene:</hi> Women at a fountain-house. The
                    fountain-house appears in the center of the picture and is represented by two
                    Doric columns with an entablature and roof. Inside the fountain-house is a
                    lion's-head spout, shown frontally, from which issues a stream of water. Six
                    women appear: (from the left) 1, balances a hydria on her head and moves to the
                    left while she looks back to her right at the others; 2, holds an empty hydria
                    crosswise on her head, grasping the vertical handle with her left hand as she
                    looks at 3, who looks back to the left at 2 and steps inside the fountain-house,
                    bending forward to hold the horizontal handles of her hydria as it is being
                    filled with water from the spout. On the floor of the fountain-house is a
                    kalpis, presumably belonging to 4, who moves to the right, but looks back to the
                    left and holds a fillet in her raised right hand; 5 and 6, with hydria and
                    kalpis balanced on their heads, stand to the right in conversation, with 6
                    looking back at 5. Each of the women wears a peplos and himation, except for
                    figure 3, who wears a peplos only. Each wears a fillet except for figure 4, who
                    wears a sakkos and carries her fillet in her hand. The sides of the left-hand
                    column of the fountain-house are outlined with incision. Regulae, each with
                    three guttae, appear on the underside of a shallow architrave. Above the
                    architrave is a frieze of alternating narrow black and broad white spaces,
                    indicating triglyphs and metopes. The frieze begins with a triglyph at the left,
                    and ends with a metope at the right. Above the shallow cornice is a low
                    pediment. <hi rend="ital">Added red</hi>: The fillets worn by
                    figures 1, 2, 3 and 5, and the dots on the garments of all six figures. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added white:</hi> The regulae, metopes and the roof
                    of the fountain-house, and dotted triplets and quadruplets (the latter with
                    incised crosses) on the garments of all figures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Shoulder:</hi> Warriors departing. A
                    charioteer (second from the right) mounts a chariot to the left. An archer,
                    standing behind the horses, looks right and raises his left hand in a gesture to
                    the warrior at the extreme right of the scene, who moves to the right, but looks
                    back to the left. To the left of the horses an old man sits on a block and
                    gestures toward them with his upraised right arm. At the far left is another
                    warrior moving towards the right. The figure at the far left wears a low-crested
                    Corinthian helmet, corslet, short chiton, baldric, greaves and carries a
                    Boeotian shield. The seated old man wears a himation. The archer has a cap,
                    tunic, trousers (?), and crossed baldrics. The charioteer wears a long robe and
                    a scabbard, and a Boeotian shield (device: a tripod) hangs on his back. The
                    warrior on the far right wears a low-crested Corinthian helmet, corslet, short
                    chiton, greaves, baldric and circular shield (device: a bull's head, caboshed).
                        <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> The borders of the shields, the
                    breastbands of the horses, their manes, and part of the chariot. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> The baldric and arm-band and dots on the
                    skirt of the chiton of the warrior at the far left; the hair and moustache of
                    the old man and his seat cover; the baldrics and dotted quadruplet on the tunic
                    of the archer; the robe and shield device of the charioteer; the baldric and
                    shield device of the warrior on the far right.</p>
                <p>There is a black tongue-pattern at the base of the neck. The main
                    scene has a leftward key-pattern above, a double chain of lotus and palmette at
                    its sides, and a chain of palmettes alternately upright and pendent below it.
                    Added red appears on the outer faces of the rotelles, on the two bands below the
                    main scene and on the single band above the rays at the base. For the graffito
                    on the underside of the foot, cf. <bibl>CVA, infra,
                        p. 40, fig. 4</bibl>.</p>
                <p>Attributed to the Priam Painter by Beazley (<bibl
                       >Para., 147, no. 5</bibl>
                    <hi rend="ital">ter</hi>). The Priam Painter is a particularly
                    noted artist of the late phase of the black-figure technique (see <rs
                        type="vase">Madison 68.14.1</rs>). Unlike many of his more
                    adventuresome colleagues, he appears to have shunned the new red-figure
                    technique, preferring to treat established black-figure themes in new
                    compositions with original detailing. Although a prolific painter, he favored
                    only a few subjects, notable among which are scenes of women at Athenian
                    fountain-houses, which appear on eight of the twenty-five hydria assigned to his
                    hand. Boardman has suggested that these hydriai with fountains were painted with
                    "some measure of sympathy for the Peisistratids," the tyrants who ruled Athens
                    between 546 and 510 B.C. and who erected many fountain-houses in the city (<bibl
                       >Boardman 1974, 112</bibl>). His fountain-house
                    scenes are balanced and clear compositions, with particular attention devoted to
                    fine points such as the details of the architecture and the fabric patterns of
                    the women's clothing. Although the focal point of the scene is the
                    fountain-house and waterspout in the center, the artist has sustained the visual
                    interest of the whole scene by ingeniously varying the poses of his figures and
                    turning their heads to form conversational groups. For a full discussion of
                    fountain-house scenes on Attic black-figure vases see <bibl

                    Theodore Lyman Wright, Professor of Greek Art (31.1). Found in a cemetery near
                    Athens and purchased from Charles Seltman.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 36.1 cm; w. including
                    handles 36.1 cm; w. 30.0 cm; h. of picture zone 15.1 cm; d. of mouth 15.4 cm; d.
                    of base 13.0 cm. Mended from many small fragments; some areas restored, cracks
                    filled and painted, base broken and repaired. Four pairs of ancient drill-holes
                    across top of picture and under handle A/B; minor surface pitting; encrustation
                    on white of charioteer's garment. Interior of neck and outer edge of lip both
                    glazed; the top and underside of lip and the inside and roots of handles are
                    reserved; resting surface and underside of foot reserved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Racing chariot and
                    driver (r.). <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> red fillet around neck
                    of vase; breast-bands, line on tails and manes of horses, hair, beard of

                    alternately top and bottom with tendrils.</p>
                <p>This vase is said to have been found in a cemetery in Athens. This
                    may strengthen recent opinion about special uses for the hydria, in funerary
                    rites, either to contain the ashes of the deceased (<bibl
                       >Diehl 1964, p. 146</bibl>) or to hold drinking water for the
                    deceased. Hydriai were sometimes found lying on their sides at burials in
                    sacrificial trenches. It cannot be documented that hydriai at gravesites
                    actually contained water or ashes but a few were found upright (<bibl
                       >Diehl 1964, p. 149</bibl>). For his libations to
                    Teiresias, Odysseus <hi rend="ital">Odyssey</hi>

                    beckons the seer with mead, wine and water, poured into a trench; elsewhere in
                    the <hi rend="ital">Odyssey</hi>, in his digression about Tantalos,
                    Homer suggests the importance of food and drink for the dead (<bibl
                        n="Hom. Od. 11.583ff">Hom. Od. 11.583ff</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The pairs of holes across the panel on the Beloit vase are ancient
                    repairs, indicating, along with its find spot, that this hydria was highly
                    prized by its owner. This particular shape for a water jug seems to be
                    innovative, c. 510 B.C., along with the stamnos and pelike. New vase shapes
                    appear about the same time as Athenian democracy. Kalpis, another word for
                    hydria, seen more often in poetry, is the term applied by specialists to this
                    more compact, unified form with neck and shoulder forming a continuous curve (to
                    compare the older form with off-set neck, see <rs type="vase"
                        >Madison 68.14.1</rs>). Because this shape appears late in the sixth
                    century, black-figure examples, especially good ones, are scarce. More unusual
                    still are the proportions of the Beloit vase.</p>
                <p>The vase is as wide as it is tall. L. D. Caskey, who studied such
                    phenomena, was convinced that the ancient Greek potter had certain formulae and
                    schemes for proportion worked out, predetermined, and that as the pot was
                    thrown, measurements were checked with calipers and corrected to insure the
                    precision of the design. In a letter to Beloit College, November 2, 1934, Caskey
                    explains, "The ratios seem to show that your vase conforms throughout to
                    combinations of squares and rectangles which can be compared, with its common
                    ratio of 1.2071, to a black-figure hydria discussed in <bibl
                       >Caskey 1922, no. 57, p. 102 with introductory remarks on p.
                        21</bibl>."</p>
                <p>The attribution to the Manner of the Antimenes Painter was made by
                    Charles Seltman, in whose collection of antiquities this particular hydria
                    remained only for a short time; a Panathenaic amphora in the Louvre (<rs
                        type="vase">Louvre F 281</rs>, <bibl
                       >CVA, France 8, Louvre 5, pls. 2.2 and 2.9</bibl>) may be by
                    the same painter. The suitability of shape and decoration are here well
                    calculated; the arc to the charioteer's back and neck for instance, gracefully
                    repeats the rhythms of the shape immediately adjacent. For the hydria: <bibl

                <p>Lent by Dr. Warren Gilson, Madison, Wisconsin, through the courtesy
                    of the Elvehjem Museum of Art, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Purchased
                    from Lincoln Higgie, Chicago.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. with handle and spur
                    14.7 cm; h. to lip 7.4 cm; d. at lip 11.2 cm; d. of foot 6.4 cm. The surface has
                    suffered from incrustation and part of the scene has flaked off the surface of
                    the vase, particularly around the lip, the right side, the interior of the cup
                    and the handle. The vase is complete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Dionysos reclines on a
                    pallet and is approached by a dancing satyr from the left and a dancing maenad
                    from the right. Behind Dionysos is a large vine with triangular-shaped leaves
                    which provide a background for the entire scene. On both sides of the scene is a
                    large "male" eye and a vine spray. Dionysos has a wreath and wears a himation.
                        <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> vine wreath in Dionysos' hair,
                    his beard and stripes on the himation; satyr: hair, beard, tail; dots on
                    maenad's garment; concentric band on "eyes." <hi rend="ital">Added
                        white:</hi> dots on god's himation; maenad's flesh and dots on garment;
                    outer zone of the "eyes." The incised details are neat with a clear, narrow,
                    sure hand. The incision of the lower chiton stripes is good but there is minimal
                    incision over the added white of the face. The large eyes are outlined in added
                    white with the irises indicated by three concentric bands of red, white and
                    black around the black center.</p>
                <p>The high, strap-handle is decorated with a raised rib running from
                    the back to the front ending in the small, relief ivy leaf below. There is a
                    small spur or thumb rest on the top of the strap-handle.</p>
                <p>The kyathos is a small, single-handled dipping cup, made in Athens
                    between 535-485 B.C. The production was almost completely confined to the
                    Nikosthenic workshop (see <rs type="vase">Columbus 58.12</rs>, <rs
                        type="vase">Kansas City 52.22</rs>) and was designed on the
                    basis of Etruscan prototypes for export to Etruria. There are about 450 known
                    examples which means that production was probably limited, and only a small
                    number would have been made each year. Our example is typical in shape, size,
                    technique and theme. Dionysiac scenes are the most common decoration on kyathoi
                    as well as other wine-connected shapes. The figure of Dionysos reclining recalls
                    the banquets during which, it is presumed, the vase would have been used. The
                    scene is unusual in several respects. First, it is one of a handful of vases in
                    which there are no figures between the large eyes and the handle. Second, the
                    painter has made the heads of Dionysos and the satyr much too large for their
                    bodies. That this is not the case for the maenad, and that there is a slightly
                    different style of incision on her figure, suggest that she was painted by a
                    second painter. This is not an unknown practice in Attic vase painting, but it
                    is not frequent and usually confined to the decoration of different parts of a
                    vase. Certainly the bold and vigorous figures of Dionysos and the satyr present
                    a contrast to the more pedestrian maenad. Thus any attempt to identify the
                    painter(s) is most difficult.</p>
                <p>The kyathos shows many affinities with the kyathoi painted by the
                    followers of Psiax, particularly with <rs type="vase">Munich
                    1984</rs> ["recalls Psiax," <bibl>Eisman, <title
                           >infra, Archaeology</title> 28 [1975] 80</bibl>]. The
                    vase is also very close to the large Group of <rs type="vase"
                        >Vatican G 57</rs>, and in particular three vases which Beazley noted as
                    connected by the shape of the cup and the elongated shape of the large eyes: <rs
                        type="vase">Brussels R 238</rs>, <rs type="vase"
                        >Sevres 2036</rs> and <rs type="vase">Cambridge GR10-1937</rs>
                        (<bibl>ABV, 610</bibl>). These characteristics
                    are shared with the Class of Munich 1963 and the Hanfmann Painter. Not only were
                    all of the kyathoi of these groups and class part of the large and adventurous
                    Nikosthenic workshop, but the workers around Psiax were particularly close to
                    the Group of <rs type="vase">Vatican G 57</rs>. With the large
                    workshop and the number of painters and potters involved, it is impossible to
                    make a closer attribution.</p>
                <p>The date of our kyathos can be placed with some confidence c. 515
                    B.C. The incision of the satyr and Dionysos, particularly the rib cage and the
                    stomach muscles, shows the influence of red-figure styles of 520-510 B.C. The
                    large eyes on Attic vases are also confined to the years 520-505 B.C., but the
                    particular nature of these eyes, with their elongated pupils, harks back to the
                    Class of Munich 1963 shape, which ends before 515 B.C. The profile of our
                    kyathos is more curvilinear than the Class of Munich 1963 (530-520), and thus
                    makes a transition to the later caliciform shape which dominated the production
                    between 515 and 505 B.C. For background and other examples see: <bibl

                    Winston Cyril Nave Fund Purchase (1979.122). Ex collection von Sodenstern,
                    Germany.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 12.4 cm; w. 18.9 cm;
                    d. of mouth 12.6 cm; d. of foot 5.5 cm. Recomposed from several fragments. Small
                    patch in plaster under handle, scuffing of white ground and glaze loss from
                    palmettes, figures and handles; chips on handles and other surface abrasions.
                    Interior of the vase is completely glazed (streaky); insides of handles, edges
                    and underside of foot reserved. Raised fillet painted red marks the junction of
                    the foot with the vase body. The foot plate is flat with conical depression in
                    center and two circlettes in dilute glaze around it, mid-way to the edge. Pairs
                    of dilute lines around the lip, beneath the figures and alternating with a
                    single, darker glaze line to the zone of rays. A fine band of billet-design near
                    rays. Edge of foot slightly indented.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The designs are similar
                    on each side; a poet, dressed in himation, hair in a sakkos, plays the kithara
                    and sings. His song spills from his mouth in words which seem to be without
                    meaning.</p>
                <p>Donna Kurtz informally has attributed this vase to the Pistias Class
                        (<bibl>ABV, 627 "M"</bibl>), being earlier and
                    finer than the rest. Stylistically, she says, it seems to go best with the
                    Circle of the Sappho and Diosphos Painters. For a discussion of the group and a

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Apollo, Athena and Dionysos. Apollo,
                    wearing a long chiton, mantle and fillet, faces right. He carries a kithara
                    which he has apparently just strummed with the plektron he holds in his right
                    hand; the hand is incised but unpainted. The plektron is attached to the
                    kithara's sound box by an incised cord. At the center, Athena, carrying a large
                    spear in her right hand and wearing a peplos and the aegis, moves to the right
                    while turning to face Apollo. Her left hand reaches toward her helmet. Behind
                    the goddess is a panther which also moves to the right but whose face is shown
                    frontally. A large bird perches on its curled tail between Apollo and Athena. On
                    the right, Dionysos strides forward but turns his head back to look at the other
                    deities. He wears an ivy wreath, a long chiton and a mantle. The god holds a
                    large vine which fills, with leaves and grape clusters, the spaces separating
                    the deities.</p>

                    dancing maenads. Dionysos, dressed in long chiton and mantle, stands at center
                    and faces right. He clutches a kantharos (seen from the side) in his left hand,
                    and holds a large grape vine in his right. Each maenad advances her right foot
                    toward Dionysos while delicately lifting her skirt with the right hand. Dionysos
                    and the left maenad wear ivy wreaths; the right maenad wears a fillet. <hi

                <p>The Putnam vase belongs to a large family of standard, late
                    sixth-century, Attic neck amphorae. Major collections of the shape have been
                    carefully studied by D. von Bothmer and M. Moore (<bibl
                       >CVA, USA 16, New York 4</bibl>), E. Kunze-G√∂tte (<bibl
                       >CVA, Germany 37</bibl>, <rs type="vase"
                       >Munich 8</rs>) and H. Hoffmann with von Bothmer and Truitt
                        (<bibl>CVA, USA 14, Boston 1</bibl>). Additional
                    collections: <bibl>CVA, France 5, Louvre 4</bibl>;

                       >CVA, GB 5, London 4</bibl>. There is nothing
                    unusual about our neck-amphora's shape or ornament. One is, therefore,
                    encouraged to observe closely the subtleties which make this vase, however close
                    to its fellows, a unique object.</p>
                <p>At first glance, the subject of A is strikingly familiar. Three Greek
                    deities, each bearing textbook attributes, are disposed in a canonical
                    three-figure composition. This particular triad (Apollo, Athena, Dionysos) is
                    unusual. Dionysos and Apollo appear together, for example, on neck-amphorae in
                    the Louvre (<rs type="vase">Louvre F 208</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre F 210</rs>: <bibl>CVA,
                        France 4, Louvre 3, pl. 23, 4 and 25, 4 respectively</bibl>; cf. <rs
                        type="vase">London B 256</rs>: <bibl
                       >CVA, GB 5, British Museum 4, pl. 63, 2a</bibl>). Dionysos
                    appears with Athena on a few neck-amphorae (e.g., <rs type="vase"
                        >Munich 1528</rs>: <bibl>ABV, 372, no.
                    168</bibl>) but Apollo and Athena are a rare combination and the Putnam vase
                    seems to be almost unique in presenting all three deities together (cf. <bibl
                       >ABV, 372, no. 167, once Palermo Market later
                        Venice Market</bibl>), <bibl>Cat. Sotheby, 28
                        June 1965, no. 94</bibl>). In a forthcoming article on the Putnam neck
                    amphora, Jerrie Pike-Brooklyn will consider this question in detail. One
                    possibility which deserves exploration is the juxtaposition of Apollo, Athena
                    and Dionysos is religious ceremonies during the <hi rend="ital"
                        >Pyanepsia</hi> festival in Athens. The <hi rend="ital"
                        >Pyanepsia</hi> was particularly associated with Apollo but on the same day,
                    the 7th of Pyanepsion. Athena and Dionysos were honored in a special ceremony
                    called the <hi rend="ital">Oschophoria</hi> (see <bibl
                       >Parke 1977, 75-81</bibl>). Perhaps their combination on the
                    vase is a reference to this popular harvest festival.</p>
                <p>It is unusual for a panther (especially one bearing a bird on his
                    tail) to appear behind Athena. Normally, the panther is associated with Dionysos
                    and perhaps here the artist simply moved the animal from right to center for the
                    sake of symmetry. A similar panther appears behind Ariadne, the consort of
                    Dionysos, on a neck amphora in London (<rs type="vase">London B
                    258</rs>: <bibl>CVA, GB 5, British Museum 4, pl. 63,
                        4b</bibl>). A goat appears behind Dionysos on a number of neck amphorae
                    (e.g., <rs type="vase">New York 41.162.179</rs>: <bibl
                       >CVA, USA 16 Metropolitan Museum 4, pl. 38, 7</bibl>; <rs

                <p>Side B, unfortunately, offers little of interest for connoisseurs of
                    Attic neck amphorae. Dionysos, flanked by maenads and/or satyrs, is perhaps the
                    most common subject on these vases. Good parallels for this abound: <rs

                <p>Although in most respects the Putnam vase is a typical production,
                    its unusual combination of Apollo, Athena and Dionysos provides an avenue for
                    further exploration. Even the most standardized Attic vases offer occasional

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. c. 16.0 cm; d. of
                    mouth 7.0 to 7.6 cm; d. of rim 8.3 to 8.8 cm; d. of foot 6.2 cm. The foot was
                    broken from the body and repaired. Part of the lip is modern. The vase was badly
                    fired and is much worn. The rim is misshaped over the reverse side. There are
                    indentations on both sides of the body: on the obverse just left of center
                    (where there is an unglazed circular red spot), and at lower right of center on
                    the reverse. The vase has an echinus rim with an inset inner edge, the neck
                    articulated by a groove at join with rim and a fillet at join with body, double
                    handles, an ovoid body joined to a broad and shallow disk foot by a narrow band
                    bordered with tooled grooves above and below. The inside of the mouth and neck
                    are black, the inside of the body reserved. The upper surface and edge of the
                    rim are reserved, the side of the rim is black, the handles are black, the foot
                    is black except for a narrow reserved band left at the lower edge. The underside
                    of the foot is reserved. There are red lines painted around the upper edge of
                    the lip, the fillet at join of neck and body, the band at join of body and foot,
                    the lower edge of the foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> On each side of the
                    neck are three palmettes, the central one pendent, the outer ones upright.
                    Around the shoulder, below its join with the neck, is a band of "tongues." Below
                    the pictures, encircling the vase, is a double row of disjoint dots bordered
                    above and below by two black lines. Rays surround the base. At each handle-zone
                    is a lotus bud pendent from four contiguous tendrils which grow out on each side
                    in lyre formation to border the handle-root and the pendent lotus, terminating
                    each in two spirals, from which spring palmettes, pendent above, upright below.
                    Two small lotus buds spring right and left from the contact points of the
                    tendrils just below the handles; the space between the contact points is dotted.
                        <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> A draped woman dances right
                    between a man at left and a boy at right, both naked. The woman wears a sakkos.
                        <hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> Two draped women dancing. Both
                    wear sakkoi. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> On Side A, band on

                    woman and hair of boy may once have been painted. On Side B, bands around
                    sakkoi, traces of paint on pleats of upper drapery and right hand of first
                    woman. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi> traces on himatia of women

                <p>This small amphora, the name-piece of the painter, belongs to the
                    Dot-band Class, named for the decorative border around the vase below the
                    pictures. One other vase by the Michigan Painter belongs to the class, as do
                    vases by the Edinburgh Painter, painters of the Leagros Group, painters of the
                    Group of Brussels R 312, and painters of the Bompas Group. The painter himself
                    belongs to the Perizoma Group, named for the large loincloths which drape their
                    male figures. They seem to have specialized in painting stamnoi, a shape which
                    had recently been introduced into the potter's repertoire. (<bibl

                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Herakles and the stag in the presence
                    of Athena. Herakles stands behind the stag on its far side and gazes downward.
                    He seizes the stag by its antlers with his left hand, while he holds his bow
                    with his right hand. He wears the lion skin over a short chiton, with a quiver
                    on his back and a scabbard at his side. The lion skin is textured with pairs of
                    short straight strokes. His knurled club leans in the field behind the stag. The
                    neck of the stag is largely restored. Athena strides into the scene from the
                    right with raised right hand. She holds a spear in her left hand. Her shield,
                    its device two balls, is shown in three-quarter view and leans next to her. She
                    wears a high-crested Attic helmet with neck-guards, a fillet and peplos; her
                    aegis is adorned with scales. The tree in the background is in the center of the
                    scene. For the letters in the field cf. <bibl>CVA,
                        USA 17, Toledo 1, p. 9, fig. 3</bibl>. <hi rend="ital">Added

                    B:</hi> Herakles and the stag in the presence of Athena, as on Side A, but with
                    some dissimilarities worth noting. The chief difference between the two sides is
                    the location of the tree: on Side A, in the center of the composition (as
                    mentioned above), on Side B, on the left side. Herakles seizes the stag with
                    both hands and stands on the near side of the stag, next to its flank. He looks
                    straight ahead. His club leans against the tree to the left. Herakles wears the
                    lion skin textured with short strokes, short chiton, scabbard by his side and
                    quiver at his back as on Side A, but here he has a double baldric, a sword
                    visible in his scabbard, and his bow is shown on his back with his quiver.
                    Athena appears as on Side A, but here her aegis is adorned with simple curved
                    strokes. As on Side A, her shield device is two balls. A band of incised,
                    transverse lines curves down across the neck of the stag, forming a ruff. For
                    the letters in the field cf. <bibl>CVA, USA 17,
                        Toledo I, p. 9, fig. 4</bibl>. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi>
                    On Herakles, his beard and belt, the top and bottom of his quiver, dots on both
                    paws of the lion skin and dot clusters on the skirt of his chiton. On Athena,
                    her fillet, two curves and a dot cluster on her aegis below each shoulder, her
                    belt, large dots and clusters of small dots on her peplos and the border of her
                    shield. On the stag, a red border along the incised ruff, a contour-stripe from
                    the nose extending under the jaw and along the throat to the chest, and groups
                    of dots on its back as on Side A. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi>
                    Herakles' baldric, the hilt of his sword, the flesh of Athena and her shield

                <p>The interior of the torus mouth and of the neck is fully glazed.
                    There is a lotus-palmette chain on the neck, and an added fillet at its base.
                    Each picture is framed by a tongue-pattern on its upper border, a plain line for
                    lateral borders and a chain of upright buds with dots in the interstices below.
                    There is a palmette at the base of each handle. The palmettes are not identical;
                    one has seven, the other nine palmettes. Two bands in added red appear below
                    both panels.</p>

                    to the animal on the Toledo amphora as the Ceryneian Hind, when, in fact, it is
                    a stag. Brommer, in <bibl><title
                            >Herakles</title> (M√ºnster/K√∂ln 1953) 24</bibl>, mentions
                    the possible existence of a variant version of this labor not mentioned in
                    ancient literature, where Herakles' struggle was with a stag, not a hind. One of
                    the notable examples of Herakles and the stag appears on a metope from the
                    Athenian Treasury at Delphi (<bibl>La
                        Coste-Messeli√®re 1957, IV, iv 119; also 119 n. 3 and 120, n. 2</bibl>
                    for some useful remarks on the iconographical problems involved in the
                    representation of this myth).</p>
                <p>The Acheloos Painter is among the most distinguished and often cited
                    members of the Leagros Group, the last and most significant group of painters of
                    large black-figure vases between about 520 and 500 B.C. The group takes its name
                    from a kalos-name appearing on five hydriai among the 400 or so vases assigned
                    to the group. The painters are staunch traditionalists, for despite the bold new
                    development of the red-figure technique, they chose to persist in that of the
                    black-figure with renewed vigor and competency. Their figure scenes are filled
                    with controlled energy and action, and they do not overindulge in finicky detail
                    at the expense of clarity.</p>
                <p>The Toledo amphora typifies these characteristics. Herakles seizes
                    the antlers of the stag, a scene that would seem to warrant rendering dynamic
                    action in order to depict dramatically the opposing forces of man and beast. Yet
                    there is little evidence of a struggle; Herakles' feet remain firmly planted on
                    the ground ‚Äî only his right heel is raised slightly ‚Äî and the stag
                    appears almost benign rather than engaged in a struggle. Here the indications of
                    force are most subtle, and must be seen in the tautness of the drawing, the
                    slight forward tilt of Herakles' torso and the backward slant of the stag's neck
                    in response to Herakles' pull on its antlers. The force of the figures lies in
                    their large scale which generously fills the panel scene. Athena's helmet-crest
                    even breaks the tongue-pattern border at the top. The tree on Side A is a
                    carefully contrived device; its branches almost explode from the center of the
                    scene, enlivening the background with bursting energy, and unifying the figures
                    and the space around them.</p>

                    17.6 cm; d. of foot 19.5 cm. Broken and repaired; missing areas restored in
                    plaster including the left hand of the man carrying an object in his right hand
                    and the female figure's face. Broken and repaired; missing areas restored in

                    Sooty black accretion at the right side of the laver rim. The interior of the
                    mouth is glazed to a depth of 2.0 cm. Below this are two glazed stripes of equal
                    width separated by narrower reserved bands. The lower part of the interior is
                    reserved. For the profile, cf. <bibl>CVA, USA 17,

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Uncertain subject.
                    Beginning with the fire, from left to right, a man to the left of the fire bends
                    forward to pour something from a basket onto the fire. Another man, facing him,
                    fans the fire. A third man runs up behind the second with something in his hand;
                    he looks back to the right and gestures (his left forearm and hand are missing)
                    to a woman and man standing at a laver or stand. The woman's hands are engaged
                    in some activity in the stand as she looks back over her shoulder at the running
                    man. Facing her on the opposite side of the stand is a man who dances and
                    gestures. In his upraised right hand he holds an oval-shaped object. A folded
                    cloak hangs in the field behind him. All the men are nude and bearded; the woman
                    wears a chiton and fillet. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> The
                    beards and wreaths of the four men; the flames rising from the fire; a row of
                    dots along the upper edge of the oval-shaped object held by the man at the right
                    of the stand; a stroke on the cloak hanging in the field. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> The flesh of the woman.</p>
                <p>Although this stand was acquired with the Toledo pointed neck-amphora
                    (see <rs type="vase">Toledo 1958.69A</rs>), there is no firm proof
                    that they belong together. The stand is certainly not by the Acheloos Painter,
                    but rather by another artist who painted two other such stands. It was
                    attributed by Beazley to the same hand as the stand found with the Panathenaic
                    amphora <rs type="vase">London B 167</rs> and a similar stand in
                    Toronto: "another stand of the same type, contemporary, and probably by the same
                    hand as those in London and Toledo, is <rs type="vase">Toronto
                    284</rs>" (<bibl>Para., 169</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Ten such Attic black-figure stands are known (cf. <bibl
                       >Lullies 1957, pp. 18-19, n. to p. 6</bibl>), of which five
                    were found at Eleusis. They depict gods and goddesses, and worshippers in solemn
                    procession. The subjects on the London and Toronto stands appear to be komoi.
                    Although the figures on the Toledo stand gesture and caper in the manner of
                    komasts, the subject is not a komos. Several suggestions have been made as to
                    the identity of the scene (cf. <bibl>CVA, USA 17,
                        Toledo 1, p. 10</bibl>). Among these, the most convincing is that suggested
                    by Brian Sparkes (<bibl>Sparkes 1962, p. 135</bibl>)
                    who identified the so-called laver or stand as a kneading-table. The rounded
                    mass at its right side would then be dough, and the man to the right of the
                    table would thus be sampling the mixture. The oblong object carried by the
                    running man to the left of the female figure would be a loaf of bread being
                    brought for baking to the fire, being fueled and fanned by the two men on either
                    side of it. For the fan, see <bibl>Sparkes 1962, 163

                    d. 31.5 cm; w. with handles 40.5 cm; d. of tondo 10.8 cm. Broken into many
                    pieces and repaired. The foot, with the center of the tondo, is missing and
                    restored. The tondo figure lacks right elbow, much of the cup and the left hand
                    holding it, part of the body and legs from waist to mid-calf; the middle letters
                    of the inscription above the figure are missing. On the obverse figure, the
                    lines of the mouth are gone; part of the left eye and lines crossed by cracks
                    are restored; part of the left leg below the knee and the inner line of that leg
                    are missing. All that remains of the reverse figure is an arm and leg and the
                    pillows on which the figure was resting; it has been suggested that the arm has
                    probably been restored to its original position (<bibl

                    probably of type A, with a fillet articulating the join of stem and body and a
                    type AY foot; the foot has been restored as a later type usually associated with
                    type B cups, and the stem is restored without a fillet at the join with the
                    body. The handles inside and the areas on the body of the cup between the
                    handle-roots and above them are reserved almost to the rim. A reserved line runs
                    around the edge of the cup just below the rim, both inside and out; on the
                    outside, the preliminary contour line beneath this reserved line continues

                    himation, reclines at left on a base-line which abbreviates a couch. His wreath
                    is done in red paint. He leans on a striped pillow and rests his foot against
                    the tondo border. In his left hand he held a lip-cup (only part of which is
                    preserved). With his right forefinger hooked in the handle of another lip-cup he
                    is about to toss the dregs of his wine, possibly at the basket which is shown
                    hanging on the wall from a red-painted strap. Around the top of the tondo, from
                    his upraised kylix to his left toe, in neat red-painted letters is inscribed
                        <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P[*O*I]*E*S*E*N</foreign> (made).

                    outside the figure zone extends from the rim to below the handles, bordered
                    above by the reserved line at rim and below by a reserved line which runs all
                    around the cup. On each side a central figure is flanked by spined palmettes
                    springing from spirals which tendril out to border the eyes at each handle. On
                    each eye a red iris is centered on the black pupil within a reserved circle. <hi
                        rend="ital">Side A:</hi> A naked, bearded, wreathed man sits

                    holds up an oinochoe and appears to be taking the measure of its contents. Along

                <p>"You cannot draw better, you can only draw differently." Nor can you
                    say it better, and Beazley's description of Epiktetos' work (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1967, 18</bibl>) is often quoted. He goes on:
                    "Epiktetos' people are all lightness and fairy grace, as if they belonged to a
                    world where passion and pain were unknown ..."</p>
                <p>Epiktetos painted a number of plates and a few vases of other shapes,
                    but cups were his bread and butter. He signed his name often; it is likely that
                        <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>
                    (painted), or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*E*G*R*A*S*F*E*N</foreign>, as he sometimes spelled it was written on the part
                    missing from the reverse of the Oberlin cup to complete the inscription <foreign
                        xml:lang="greek">*E*P*I*K*T*E*T*O*S</foreign> on the obverse.
                    A dozen of his cups bear the kalos-name Hipparchos, possibly of the family of
                    the tyrant Peisistratos, perhaps his son.</p>
                <p>One extant inscription tells us that Epiktetos made vases himself,
                    one that he worked for Andokides, in whose shop the red-figure technique seems
                    to have been developed. He worked for others, too, among them Hischylos, whose
                    name appears on his cups a number of times as potter; it is possible that Oltos
                    also decorated cups for Hischylos. Like Oltos and the Nikosthenes Painter,
                    Epiktetos decorated cups for Pamphaios (as here) and Nikosthenes (see <rs
                        type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.64</rs>). From
                    Epiktetos an artistic tradition can be traced through Psiax, who influenced him
                    and was influenced by him, to the Amasis Painter, while Oltos' line runs back
                    through the Andokides Painter to Exekias (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 76.89</rs>, <rs type="vase">Bloomington 71.82</rs>,
                    and <rs type="vase">Champaign 70.8.1</rs>).</p>
                <p>There are a number of eye-cups to be seen here, in the black-figure,
                    red-figure, and bilingual techniques (<rs type="vase">Champaign
                        70.8.1</rs>, <rs type="vase">Milwaukee N 17928/22266</rs>, and
                        <rs type="vase">Toledo 1963.28</rs>: <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 59</bibl>, and <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 76.89</rs>). The most numerous class of those eye-cups which have
                    red-figure decoration is bilingual, the inside black-figure, the outside
                    red-figure, like the Toledo cup by the Bowdoin-Eye Painter, <rs type="vase"
                       >Toledo 1963.28</rs>, where the palmettes are by the handles,
                    the eyes next to them. The red-figure Oberlin cup is of a later class, with the
                    eyes by the handles and the palmettes flanking the figures. Oltos, Epiktetos,
                    the Nikosthenes Painter, the Bowdoin-Eye Painter, and several others did cups of
                    this class, but soon "the four palmettes are cut to two and tucked away under
                    the handles, the ground once occupied by eyes and palmettes is left free for
                    figures" (<bibl>Beazley 1967, 8</bibl>; cf. the
                    Madison cup by the Penthesilea Painter, <rs type="vase">Madison
                        1976.31</rs>, with palmettes only under the handles).</p>
                <p>Set the Florence-Chicago cup, <rs type="vase">University
                        of Chicago 1967.115.64</rs>, by Oltos, beside this one and we have a rousing
                    evening with music, wine, and games ‚Äî kottabos, balancing acts, and
                    women. Beazley saw the figure on the reverse of the Oberlin cup as male, but
                    others argue that it must be a woman, who, though incomplete, completes the
                    evening (<bibl>Mac Sweeney <title
                            >infra</title> 113</bibl> and <bibl
                        >Finkenstaedt <title>infra</title> 241</bibl>). The game of
                    kottabos was often played by tossing the wine lees from a cup toward a target.
                    In the vase paintings players are usually shown aiming to knock a disk off a
                    stand on which it is balanced. <bibl>E. Finkenstaedt
                            <title>(ibid.)</title></bibl> observed that here the
                    reclining figure in the tondo appears to have made his toss at a basket and got
                    a hit, for the basket seems to be swinging.</p>
                <p>The description above is taken in large part from A. Mac Sweeney's

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; given by Professor F. B. Tarbell (1967.115.64, formerly UC 285).
                    Belongs with fragments from the Campana Collection in the Museo Archeologico,
                    Florence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Fragment:</hi> Max. dim. 16.6 cm;
                    th. 0.4 cm; reconstructed d. ca. 33.0 cm. The fragment is from the lower,
                    central part of the reserved side of a large kylix, type B. It is put together
                    from three pieces, the edges rasped smooth. There are some chips and scratches.
                    The reserved areas are mottled and worn, the black glaze inside and out is good.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> On the inside, only a
                    bit of the reserved circle bordering the tondo remains. Outside there is
                    preserved the lower part of a komos, a party scene. A large mixing bowl
                    (calyx-krater), holding a wine-cooler (psykter), rests on the ground. Directly
                    above it is the bowl of a ladle, held by the figure at right, of which there
                    remain leg, foot, and lower drapery. At left, a lyre player, draped in himation
                    and holding a plectrum in his right hand, moves toward the krater, while another
                    figure, wearing chiton and himation, follows behind him. A reserved line borders
                    the scene below.</p>
                <p>Red paint was used for the string attaching plectrum to lyre. Sketch
                    marks show the lines of legs and right foot of the figure at left, and some
                    drapery pleats. Relief outline is lacking for some short edges of drapery, the
                    chiton hem of the figure at left, the feet of all figures, the handles and foot
                    of the calyx-krater, the neck and body of the psykter, the ladle. The broad
                    contour line is so thick that it is sometimes hard to distinguish its edge from
                    relief outline.</p>
                <p>An inscription which has been read as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*A*N*T*A*N*D*R*O</foreign> is painted in uneven red
                    letters between the lyre player and ladler, over the vases. The letter following
                    T is quite small and could be taken as omicron. The last letter, taken as
                    omicron, is open, or incomplete, on its right side. On the left side of the
                    fragment, in the angle of the break opposite the fall of drapery over the
                    figure's left shoulder, is an omicron, painted in red.</p>
                <p>This fragment, like many others which have come to rest at The
                    University of Chicago, belongs to an interesting and complicated passage in the
                    history of Greek vase collecting in nineteenth century Italy, involving the
                    financial fall and the imprisonment of the collector Campana, the intervention
                    of the Emperor Louis-Napoleon, the sale of parts of the collection to the
                    Russian and French governments, to the Belgian government and to Florence, the
                    mysterious appearance of joining fragments in the Castellani collection at the
                    Museo de Villa Giulia and elsewhere, the efforts of various scholars to identify
                    joins, the exchange of red-figure and black-figure fragments between Florence
                    and Rome, efforts to bring about exchanges between other collections in order to
                    form whole vases from fragments (see <bibl>von
                        Bothmer 1977, 214f</bibl>.).</p>
                <p>The Chicago fragment (fig. a) constitutes the lower central section
                    from the reverse side of a cup, of which the greater part is made up from
                    fragments in Florence (and part which was once in the Villa Giulia). Johnson had
                    already recognized the authorship of the Chicago fragment when Beazley wrote to
                    him requesting pictures to confirm his suspicion of a join with the ones in
                    Florence (<bibl><title>Art Bulletin,
                            infra,</title> p. 537</bibl>). The Soprintendenza alle Antichit√†,
                    Florence, has kindly allowed us to publish pictures of the fragments in the
                    Museo Archeologico. The obverse side (fig. d1) shows three men, all wearing
                    shawls, involved in a sword-fight; there are palmettes and lotusbuds in the
                    handle-zones (fig. d2); the tondo figure (fig. e) has been identified as a
                    flute-girl. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*M*N*O*N
                    *K[*A]*L*O*S</foreign> is inscribed on this side. Almost all the extent vases
                    with this kalos-name were painted by Oltos.</p>
                <p>The reverse fragments in Florence show the typically Oltan hand of
                    the figure at left, the head of the bearded lyre player, and the upper part of
                    his lyre (fig. b), and the head of the figure holding the ladle (fig. c). This
                    beardless figure has been taken by some to be male, by others female; chiton and
                    himation could be worn by either. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                        >*E*U*A*G*O*R*A</foreign> is inscribed on this section.</p>
                <p>The scene is interesting for the representation of a wine-filled
                    psykter, or wine-cooler, shown set in a calyx-krater and either floating in cold
                    water or embedded in snow. The psykter is an open-mouthed, bulbous-bodied vase
                    with a long, hollow, cylindrical stem (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Bloomington 75.102.1</rs>). It was developed in the red-figure period and
                    some illustrious painters decorated the shape, but it was soon dropped from the
                    potter's repertory.</p>
                <p>Oltos himself painted such psykters, and several other large vases,
                    but he was a prolific painter of cups, in which the development of the shape can
                    be traced for over a quarter of a century from almost the inception of the
                    red-figure technique to the beginning of the late archaic period. The Andokides
                    Painter, "inventor" of the red-figure technique, may have been his teacher (cf.
                        <rs type="vase">Cleveland 27.433</rs>); Epiktetos was his
                    contemporary (<rs type="vase">Oberlin 67.61</rs>); the younger
                    "Pioneers" who exploited the technique to examine the range of human action
                    eventually influenced him. He crosses paths with Euphronios, who painted the
                    fragmentary neck pelike, <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                        1967.115.1</rs>. That piece has been associated by Ada Bruhn (<bibl
                       >Bruhn 1943, 66, n. 85</bibl>) with an early
                    Leagros period group of vases by Oltos which includes the Florence-Chicago
                    kylix.</p>
                <p>Oltos collaborated with a number of potters, among them Nikosthenes
                    and Pamphaios, for whom Epiktetos also worked, and Kachrylion and Euxitheos, for
                    whom Euphronios painted vases.</p>

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; given by Professor F.B. Tarbell (1967.115.1, formerly UC 287). From
                    Cervetri. Ex Collection Castellani. Other fragments belonging to the same vase
                    are in the Museo di Villa Giulia in Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. w. 18.5 cm; th. of
                    wall 0.35 to 0.45 cm; th of neck 0.6 cm. Put together from seven pieces. There
                    are some chips, nicks, pitting and encrustation; the surface is scratched and
                    abraded. One piece, at lower right, which includes the elbow of the figure,
                    seems to have been preserved under different circumstances from the rest: the
                    reserved parts, including chips, are very red. Outside, the black glaze is very
                    shiny, the wash over the reserved areas very orange. The fragment is reserved
                    inside; the orange clay is dark in the break. There remains a small part of the
                    neck and part of the shoulder of a neck-pelike. A ring molding separated neck
                    and body; it is painted red.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> A bit of black palmette
                    and tendril on a reserved background remains on the neck, bordered below by a
                    black line. Large tongues just below the join of neck and body border the
                    picture above; a battlement pattern borders the sides. The upper part of a young
                    man is preserved, facing left, a red-painted wreath around his hair, a walking
                    stick in the crook of his left arm. His hair is outlined in reserve; thick
                    raised dots of paint about the head indicate curls. Thin glaze is used for
                    side-burns, the nostril, and possibly for markings of the abdomen. There appears
                    to have been relief outline everywhere; it would seem that the lips and tip of
                    the nose are not outlined, but traces of relief show in strong light (much is
                    worn away). The relief line varies in thickness and quality. Sketch marks are
                    visible for arms and chest.</p>
                <p>At right, behind the figure, reading left to right and down,
                    inscribed in neat red-painted letters: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                        >*L*E*A*G[*R*O*S]</foreign>. At left, in front of the figure, similarly:
                        <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>
                <p>This fragment must represent for us the work of the "Pioneers" of
                    red-figure vase-painting, Phintias, Euthymides, and Euphronios, whose
                    adventurous intellects were prompted by the new technique and the new spirit of
                    the time to examine the human body closely and to try to record accurately its
                    twistings and turnings, its motion and relaxation. Like the fragments by the
                    Niobid Painter, <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                    1967.115.60</rs>, <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                        1967.115.410</rs> from a later generation, this sample represents the
                    painter, but not his major importance. It is however remarkable for a number of
                    reasons: it is from one of the few known vases of the shape; it is one of only
                    two works by Euphronios in the United States, the other being a large and
                    beautiful calyx-krater in New York; it is an early work by the painter; it
                    attests to an important point of contact between him and the older painter
                    Oltos.</p>
                <p>The fragment is known to have come from among the vases in the
                    Castellani Collection, a great part of which was acquired from persons who had
                    conducted excavations at Cervetri, the ancient Caere in southern Etruria.</p>
                <p>Part of the collection passed to the state and is now in the Museo di
                    Villa Giulia in Rome. From 1865, however, much was sold, chiefly to museums; but
                    some also went to private clients (<bibl>Bartoccini
                        and de Agostino <title>infra</title> 25</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Chicago piece (fig. a) was already at the University in 1898. It
                    belongs to the reverse side of the vase, the rest of which, with the foot and
                    obverse side, are in the Villa Giulia, (h. 33.5 cm; d. of mouth 14.5 cm; d. of
                    foot 16.3 cm). The Villa Giulia part (fig. b) shows that the young man here is
                    seated on a folding stool <hi rend="ital">(okladias)</hi> and that
                    he is playing with his pet, a marten or weasel (Beazley in <bibl
                       >Caskey &amp; Beazley, ii 1f</bibl>. and <bibl
                       >Caskey &amp; Beazley, iii 29</bibl>). The
                    inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*E*A*G</foreign> ... on
                    the Chicago fragment is here completed with ... <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*R*O*S</foreign>. "On the sides of the vase are black
                    palmettes" (<bibl>Johnson <title
                            >infra</title> 538</bibl>; does this mean below the handles?). The disk
                    foot has an Etruscan graffito underneath (<bibl
                        >Pallottino, <title>infra</title></bibl>). The observe shows
                    a boy fastening the sandal of a seated youth, a picture pendent to the reverse
                    of another neck-pelike by Euphronios, also in the Villa Giulia, showing a seated
                    man chastising a boy with a sandal.</p>
                <p>This second neck-pelike by Euphronios has a torus rim with a thick
                    fillet dividing it from the neck, a narrow fillet separating the neck and body,
                    and a disk foot. The subsidiary decoration is similar to the Chicago-Villa
                    Giulia pelike, but the neck floral is reserved on a black background: three
                    palmettes, the lateral ones encircled, all with black hearts. Both pictures are
                    bounded above by tongues. Unlike ours, the tongues are alternately reserved and
                    dark, and bordered below by a straight line. Instead of the battlement pattern,
                    running key is used to border the pictures below, and on the sides of the
                    obverse picture as well. On the reverse a young hunter walks before a horse,
                    over whose back a bird is flying.</p>
                <p>Both neck-pelikai are early works by the painter, and may represent
                    the first step in the development of the canonical pelike form (<bibl
                       >von Bothmer 1951, p. 47</bibl>). There are very
                    few neck-pelikai painted in either the black-figure or red-figure technique. A
                    pelike in Leningrad, once attributed to Euphronios (<bibl
                       >ARV1, 17, no. 9</bibl>; <bibl
                        >ARV2, 1594, no. 48</bibl>) the neck decorated but not physically
                    articulated, is perhaps "the earliest pelike in which neck and body merge in a
                    continuous curve" (<bibl>von Bothmer 1951, p.
                    47</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Martin Robertson suggests that it could as well be an early work by
                    Euphronios' rival Euthymides (<bibl>M. Robertson
                        1975, 221</bibl>). There is a fragmentary red-figure pelike in the Louvre by
                    Euthymides and a few by other "Pioneers"; most of the pelikai by the Berlin
                    Painter are early and could probably be counted with these. It is not until
                    somewhat later that the shape begins to take favor in red-figure with the
                    pelikai of Myson and the painters of the Syleus Sequence. It would seem that
                    while the shape originated after the introduction and possibly under the
                    influence of the red-figure technique, it was most popular for a short time
                    among painters working in black-figure (see <rs type="vase"
                        >University of Chicago 1967.115.68</rs>).</p>
                <p>The Leningrad pelike and the two neck-pelikai by Euphronios all bear
                    the inscription "<foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*E*A*G*R*O*S
                        *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>" (Leagros is beautiful). "Leagros" is one of the
                    so-called love-names which have helped to fix the chronology of Attic
                    vase-painting by association with historical figures, in this case a general who
                    is known to have fallen in battle in 465 B.C. and who must have been boy and
                    young man in the last decades of the sixth century. The expression naming a
                    certain person kalos (or rarely kale, of a woman) occurs often in the literature
                    as well as in inscriptions and graffiti. It could naturally be used of a
                    particular friend but it was customary to apply it to certain boys or young men
                    in the city who were renowned for their beauty, much as our movie stars of
                    athletes are popularized. In ancient Greece, the association was usually
                    homosexual; this was explicit and normal. There are similar references to older
                    men, too, but they occur less frequently. On the vases, the kalos-name has been
                    taken to indicate a special order from the purchaser, to name one of the figures
                    shown, to advertise the preference of public or painter for the current favorite
                    (the potters' quarter was a fashionable gathering place for the young men of the
                    city). In the case of "Leagros" the number of vases with his name is so great
                    that all these possibilities must be taken into consideration. The name of his
                    son Glaukon is seen on vases of the next generation. Many anonymous painters are
                    called after a kalos-name they used: the Antimenes Painter (<rs type="vase"
                       >Cleveland 75.1</rs> and others), the Eucharides Painter (<rs
                        type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.68</rs>), the Euaion
                    Painter (<rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.22</rs>), and so on.</p>
                <p>Euphronios painted mostly big vases, but some cups, a plate, and a
                    skyphos are also attributed to him. He signed five vases as painter, and the
                    signature "Euphronios" as potter occurs on a number of vases too. We know that
                    Euphronios painted vases for the potters Euxitheos and Kachrylion, and it is
                    certainly possible that he made vases which he painted himself. But the ones
                    potted by "Euphronios" are not painted by him. They are all cups and all later
                    than the vases signed with that name as painter; possibly Euphronios turned
                    exclusively to potting in his later years. Where Phintias and Euthymides were
                    followed by pot-painters, Euphronios seems to have influenced cup-painters in
                    the next generation.</p>
                <p>The Chicago-Villa Giulia neck-pelike and the Leningrad pelike have
                    been seen to exhibit the earliest signs of contact between Euphronios and the
                    older cup-painter, Oltos: an interior by Oltos imitates the posture of the
                    seated figures in a way that is clearly borrowed and not his own (<bibl
                       >Johnson <title>infra</title>
                    559</bibl>, and <bibl>Bruhn 1943</bibl>. Although
                    Oltos was working in the Pioneer period, he is not numbered among the
                    adventurers of early red-figure vase-painting (see <rs type="vase"
                        >University of Chicago 1967.115.64</rs>). The "Pioneers" were conscious of
                    the significance of their work: in a number of inscriptions they name each
                    other, and Euthymides wrote on one of his vases (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 26, no. 1</bibl>), "Euphronios never did anything like
                    this."</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 41.3 cm; w. 27.8 cm;
                    d. of base 7.7 cm; d. of neck 9.0 cm. Mended from several large fragments, with
                    a large triangular patch in plaster on B across maenad's body. Section of lip
                    repaired; minor chips and surface abrasion. The inside of the neck is glazed and
                    there is a reserved line near the top. Top of rim, insides of handles and
                    underside of foot reserved. The handles are triple-ribbed. Tongue-patterns,
                    alternately red and black, at base of neck; rays above foot; under handles,
                    palmette fans on spidery tendrils, with pointed lotusbud and diamond enclosure,
                    dotted, at the center of the arrangement. Lotus chain under picture connected at
                    every other position on top. In pencil, under foot: E 8698.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> a scene in Hades, with Hermes,
                    Cerberus and Sisyphos. Hermes, wearing his usual dress of chlamys, petasos and
                    winged boots, carries the kerykeion in his right hand and gestures to Sisyphos
                    with his left. Sisyphos, waging eternal battle with the rock, turns toward
                    Hermes. Cerberus scrutinizes Hermes with one head, Sisyphos with the other. The
                    gates of Hades are represented architecturally, with unfluted Doric columns
                    which divide the scene in two. The columns have echinus and abacus, and the
                    architrave, which is above only one column, is accentuated by a broad, white
                    stripe. There are two pairs of incised annulets under the echinus; between
                    these, on the upper part of one column, there are three zigzags. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added red:</hi> fillet in Hermes' hair, his beard and the wings
                    on his boots; Cerberus' mane has alternate red and white tufts; Sisyphos' beard,
                    fillet, border on chiton. <hi rend="ital">Added white:</hi>
                    Cerberus' teeth and mane; architrave; border on Sisyphos' rock. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B:</hi> a party of three revelers <hi rend="ital"
                       >(komasts).</hi> The woman, perhaps a maenad, moves to the right
                    and wears an animal-skin <hi rend="ital">(nebris);</hi> two bearded
                    men, clothed around the waist, both walk to the right, one on either side of
                    her. The maenad has turned back to look at the companion who carries the wine
                    skin; the man in front of her has a knobby staff in his right hand. <hi
                        rend="ital">Added red:</hi> ivy wreaths (alternate leaves),
                    beards, dots and thin stripes on woman's garment, wine-skin. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> woman's flesh.</p>
                <p>Only four complete black-figure neck-amphorae by this painter have
                    survived; a neck-amphora from Vulci, now <rs type="vase">W√º
                        rzburg L 222</rs> (<bibl>ABV, 405, no.
                    20</bibl>), is closest in style to the St. Louis vase. Side A bears a kitharode
                    between columns, the architectural features of which and the manner in which
                    they divide the scene recall those between Hermes and Sisyphos. Side B of the
                    W√ºrzburg vase depicts a maenad on a donkey with Dionysos along side: the
                    position of Dionysos with back-turned head and legs apart duplicates the
                    attitude of Sisyphos. The shape and position of the palmette fans and the
                    fibrous wire-like tendrils on which the fans are perched are comparable; the
                    W√ºrzburg neck-amphora has a predella of lions and boars while Mrs. Cone's
                    vase does not. On the fragment of the neck-amphora, <rs type="vase"
                        >Frankfort B 286</rs>, ivy branches separate Dionysos and Hephaistos as the
                    columns had on the other neck-amphorae. Whether this fragment is by the
                    Kleophrades Painter or a pupil, figure-style, composition and subsidiary
                    decoration are close.</p>
                <p>The Kleophrades Painter's neck-amphorae were probably decorated in
                    the same early period of his career as the calyx-krater at <rs type="vase"
                       >Harvard 1960.236</rs> (<bibl>ARV2,
                        185, no. 31</bibl>). On this krater, satyrs struggle to lift bulky, weighty
                    objects ‚Äî an enormous volute krater for instance ‚Äî as Sisyphos
                    does with his rock. Beazley called this krater "very early" and the satyrs are
                    given bodies with little musculature, long arms and rounded shoulders comparable
                    to the rendition of the komasts and Sisyphos. Sisyphos' pose is nearly identical
                    to that of a komast, who is the central figure on Side B of an amphora type A
                        (<rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L 507</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 181, no. 1</bibl>), another vase which is called "very
                    early." The figure directly behind this komast recalls the reveller carrying the
                    wine-skin on Side B of Mrs. Cone's vase.</p>
                <p>The Kleophrades Painter was a noteworthy vase decorator and his
                    talents, by virtue of the quantity of his work which has survived, must have
                    been in great demand. As often occurs to meet demand, an artist will depend upon
                    fixed types and formulate. One need only compare the figure of Sisyphos ‚Äî
                    moving to the right, legs apart, frontal chest, carrying a large object, head
                    turned back ‚Äî to the reveller on the other side of the very same vase.
                    Perhaps his persistence in using such figural types was something of a dodge
                    from dealing with the third dimension in a studied and consistent way. This he
                    attempts later in some of his red-figure work, e.g. back view of Ajax on Side A
                    of an amphora type A (<rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L 508</rs>:
                        <bibl>ARV2, 182, no. 5</bibl>) and in these
                    efforts he recalls his mentor, Euthymides.</p>
                <p>At one time Hauser (<bibl><title
                           >JHS</title> 30 [1910] 38-68</bibl>) and other scholars
                    believed the work of the Kleophrades Painter to have been a later stage of the
                    great Euthymides himself (<bibl>Hoppin 1917,
                    40</bibl>). Beazley attributed two of the Kleophrades Painter's neck-amphorae
                    ‚Äî <rs type="vase">W√ºrzburg L 222</rs> (<bibl
                       >ABV, 405, no. 20</bibl>) and <rs type="vase"
                       >New York 41.162.189</rs> (<bibl
                        >ABV, 405, no. 17</bibl>) ‚Äî to the Eucharides Painter, a pupil of the
                    Nikoxenos Painter who worked both in black and red-figure ("Panathenaica," <bibl
                       ><title>AJA</title> 47 [1943]
                    447</bibl>). Eucharides and Kleophrades Painters decorate a large number of
                    black-figure Panathenaic prize-vases in the late sixth and early fifth century.
                    Although we call him the Kleophrades Painter ‚Äî after the potter's name
                    "Kleophrades" on a cup in the Cabinet des M√©dailles (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 181</bibl>) ‚Äî his actual name is known. The
                    painter signs Epiktetos <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign> on both sides of a red-figure pelike, <rs

                       >ARV2, 185, no. 28</bibl>).<note n="*" place="unspecified"
                        anchored="true">
                        <p>This attribution has since proven to be false: see <bibl

                    </note> This vase is late in his career and of so little artistic merit that the
                    conventional name has stuck. His three-figure compositions and his delight with
                    komasts and revellers, among other aspects, prove the Kleophrades Painter's
                    interaction, not only with Euthymides but with the Eucharides Painter. In this
                    regard one need only compare the komasts on the Cone neck-amphora with figures
                    on Side A of the pelike by the Eucharides Painter in this exhibition (<rs
                        type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.68</rs>). Other
                    practitioners, contemporary to the Kleophrades Painter, have similar
                    compositions and figure-style and designed both in black and red-figure: the
                    Dikaios Painter, the Troilos Painter and the Goettingen Painter. The latter's
                    column krater, once on the Paris market (<bibl>ARV2,
                        235, no. 9</bibl>), is especially close; on Side A a fellow leans over a
                    laver or basin.</p>
                <p>Scenes of Hades and the particular treatment on this vase have
                    recently been discussed: <bibl><title

                    depicted (see <rs type="vase">Toledo 1950.261</rs>, shoulder).</p>

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; received by Professor F. B. Tarbell from Mr. E. P. Warren, 1902
                    (1967.115.68, formerly UC 340).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 34.2 cm; d. of mouth
                    12.3 cm; d. of rim outside 14.3 cm; d. of foot 14.5 cm; max. d. 24.2 cm at about
                    12.5 cm from the base. Broken and repaired; much pitted, scratched, abraded,
                    with indications of disease, especially along incision marks, some covered with
                    India ink. One large piece, missing from the rim over the Sphinx, is restored
                    with plaster, and on the reverse a triangular piece is missing and restored at
                    Hermes' left knee and shin and through part of his lower right leg. On the
                    obverse there is a dent in the body of the pot at the middle of the Sphinx's
                    column. There is a thickened ridge around the inside of the vase at the level of
                    the lower join of the upper handle-roots. This shows in a mark along the lotus
                    bordering the obverse panel above the Sphinx. The pelike has the torus mouth and
                    spreading foot, the handles segmental in section, the low center of gravity
                    characteristic of the shape. Apart from the picture panels, all is black.
                    Inside, a 2.0 cm band was left reserved around the rim, below which 5.5 cm of
                    black covers the inside of the neck. Below this is a narrow reserved band,
                    apparently darkened with wash, for it is set off from the reserved inner side of
                    the vase itself. Turning marks are visible inside the vase. A narrow band at the
                    base of the foot outside, the underside of the foot, and the underside of the
                    rim are reserved. Tooled grooves articulate the narrow fillet which joins body
                    and foot. A red line is painted around the neck on each side at the point where
                    the upper handle-roots join it, and there are traces of another red line painted
                    about the upper edge of the foot. Two red-painted lines encircle the vase below
                    the picture panels. The glaze is fired a shiny black, going to green in places,
                    especially in the area of the handle A/B, where vertical brush-strokes are
                    visible above the red lines, horizontal ones below them. Red wash, fired very
                    orange, covers all visible reserved areas. Thick black outlines can be seen in
                    places where the black filling the silhouette is thin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The pictures on both
                    sides are framed by a sloppy and uneven chain of dotted, linked lotus-buds
                    above, two vertical rows of unconnected uneven dots at each side, and a reserved
                    band below. The tendrils linking the lotus below cross each other. <hi
                        rend="ital">Side A:</hi> On a pedestalled column, a Sphinx sits
                    to right on her haunch (one hind leg, two front legs show). Her head is turned
                    back toward a bearded naked man who is just departing, his walking stick in
                    hand, his himation flung over his left arm and shoulder. He in turn looks back
                    toward the Sphinx and the bearded man standing pensive before her. The latter,
                    draped in himation, leans on his walking stick, his head bowed, his weight on
                    his left foot. Traces of white remain on the Sphinx's face and neck; there were
                    raised dots of paint to indicate curls at the back of her head but only chipped
                    areas remain. Short, vertical, incision marks across the heads of the Sphinx and
                    the man at left: are they strands of hair or wreaths? <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B:</hi> Hermes, hatted, booted, swathed about the hips,
                    walks to right playing the double pipes, a flute-case made of skin hanging from
                    his left arm. A sword hangs at his left side from a red-painted strap across his
                    chest; white paint was used for the scabbard end. Yellowish-white paint covered
                    the crown of his hat. His hair is tied up at the back in a loop. Two satyrs
                    dance wildly about him, the one at left twisting all the way around so that
                    while his near leg is forward, his torso is in frontal view; the satyrs' tails
                    end in three large fringes each. Over the shoulder and down the chest of each
                    satyr hangs one long rectangular tress of hair. On the satyr at left, a curious
                    projection at his armpit in thin glaze, much like the tail fringes, should be a
                    strand of hair flying out from the back of his head-hair shown at the armpit
                    would be, I think, unprecedented.</p>
                <p>Fingers against the reserved background, and tail fringes, are done
                    in thinned glaze. The top and bottom edges at the front of Hermes' hatbrim are
                    outlined with incision. On the obverse, relief lines were used to outline part
                    of the staff of the left-hand figure above his shoulder, and the staff of the
                    right-hand figure from the drapery around his waist to the bottom of the column
                    pedestal. Incision outlines the upper leg of the latter where the staff crosses
                    it. Graffiti on the underside of the foot: on the slope from the resting
                    surface, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*T*A*L*H*K</foreign>; on the
                    center base,</p>
                <p>The surge of creative activity in the last quarter of the sixth
                    century brought forth a number of new shapes after the introduction of the
                    red-figure technique, among them the pelike. It is an endearing sort of
                    big-bottomed amphora, a two-handled jar for wine or oil, first made
                    experimentally, it would seem, with an articulated neck (cf. <rs type="vase"
                       >University of Chicago 1967.115.1</rs>). Although it looks to
                    have been made in one piece, the ridge inside around the level of the upper
                    handle-roots on the Chicago pelike seems to indicate a join. The Chicago vase is
                    not unique in this respect ‚Äî the thickened ridge is present in many
                    red-figure pelikai.</p>
                <p>Not all, but many black-figure pelikai were decorated by painters of,
                    or painters connected with, the Leagros Group, to which belong the black-figure
                    vases, including the pelikai, of the Eucharides Painter's teacher, the Nikoxenos
                    Painter. The Eucharides Painter, primarily a red-figure artist, is called after
                    a kalos-name which occurs certainly on only two vases, both by him. His
                    black-figure work is so close in style to that of his teacher that, but for the
                    disparate styles of their red-figure work, Beazley would have considered the
                    painters as one (<bibl>ABV, 395</bibl>). Note
                    particularly the drawing of the deep and angular breasts, the concave line of
                    the hip-bones, the drapery drawn horizontally across the bodies. A neat solution
                    to this problem of differences and similarities has been posed by the suggestion
                    that the Eucharides Painter, a better artist in red-figure than his teacher,
                    eventually might have taken over that side of their production, while the
                    black-figure work now attributed to him might instead be the later work of the
                    Nikoxenos Painter (<bibl>M. Robertson, AJA 66 [1962]
                        312</bibl>). That the black-figure pelikai of the Nikoxenos Painter have no
                    consistent pattern of subsidiary decoration, while those attributed to the
                    Eucharides Painter do (cf. <bibl>von Bothmer 1951,
                        p. 46</bibl>), is no grave encumbrance to this theory: in his earlier work
                    the Nikoxenos Painter experiments, in his later work he fixes on one scheme-the
                    lotus-bud, dot-net, and reserved line of the Chicago pelike‚Äîto border his
                    pelikai pictures. On red-figure pelikai this same system of subsidiary
                    decoration is characteristic of those of Myson (a contemporary of the Eucharides
                    Painter) and his followers, the Mannerists. Few other red-figure artists use it
                    on pelikai. The Eucharides Painter himself did not frame the pictures on the two
                    red-figure pelikai attributed to him.</p>
                <p>The painter chose interesting subjects for the pictures on his
                    black-figure pelikai: a shoemaker, the sale of oil, the capture of Silenos. One,
                    like the Chicago vase, shows Hermes playing the flute, but to a satyr and a
                    goat. A man (with satyrs) on the reverse of the shoemaker scene might have been
                    meant for Hermes, too. Hermes was a popular figure in Greek vase-painting at the
                    end of the sixth century and the beginning of the fifth, appearing often with
                    other gods, with heroes, and with satyrs. Among his other functions and
                    activities he was sacred to shepherds and was supposed to have invented the
                    pipes. He does not usually sport a sword, but the hat, short drape, and boots
                    are his. The long tongues of these boots are sometimes taken as wings, but they
                    also appear on boots worn by Hermes which have wings attached at the backs. Two
                    huntsmen on one of the Eucharides Painter's black-figure pelikai (<bibl
                       >ABV, 396, no. 24</bibl>) both wear boots with
                    long tongues; neither need be, and both cannot be, Hermes. Beazley called the
                    tongues handles for pulling on boots (<bibl><title
                           >JHS</title> 28 [1908] 314</bibl>). The scene on the
                    obverse, visitors to the Sphinx, occurs on red-figure as well as black-figure
                    vases. The Sphinx, a lion-bodied creature with woman's head, eagle's wings, and
                    serpent's tail, came to Greece by way of the East and was early carved on
                    tombstones as guardian. It also figures prominently in the story of Oedipus, so
                    we may see here visitors at a tomb, visitors to an actual Sphinx, or Oedipus
                    confronting the Sphinx of Thebes.</p>
                <p>One interpretation sees the obverse and reverse pictures of this vase
                    related by the mysteries of life and death, joy and gloom, and by Hermes' dual
                    functions as god of pastoral pleasure, and chaperone to the underworld (<bibl

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 24.1 cm; h. (to handle
                    top) 24.5 cm; w. 14.2 cm; d. of foot 8.65 cm; liquid contents ca. 1.75 liters.
                    Dense clay with fine, sandy structure, very few enclosures, medium-hard. 6.5 YR
                    7.5/5 pink light-brown to reddish-yellow (Munsell).</p>
                <p>The vessel has been reconstituted with some minor restorations in
                    plaster. The oinochoe stands on a broad disk foot with a sharply precisioned,
                    finely curved torus at the outside. The interior of the foot moves up in a
                    swift, even curve to the bottom. Between the foot and the body, topping the low
                    stem, projects a fine, sharp ridge. The body rises in a short, convex flare;
                    thereabove the wall follows in a broad, inverted egg-shape. The wide shoulder
                    runs in an even rise, the neck is set off above by a sharp, somewhat undercut
                    step. It is broad, and the trefoil is formed by a very deep pinch, somewhat
                    towards the front. The top of the lip is flattened and gently carinated,
                    projecting outwards. The solid, round handle rises vertically from the shoulder
                    and turns towards the lip in a rather flat curve. To either side of the handle
                    attachments, the front part of a snake winds on top of the lip, molded in
                    reserved clay. The body design has been rendered in short, careful lines, the
                    modeling of the head includes bumps for the ears. All body decoration has been
                    painted over added white, the lower portion above the foot shows fifty slender
                    rays, rising from a narrow black line a short distance above the purple line
                    which covers the ridge between body and foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The shoulder field is
                    separated into three parts: below, the meander; in the middle (and main) zone,
                    the diamond net-pattern; above, a frieze of tongues. All ornaments are precisely
                    and carefully drawn. The lower meander border features two interlocking
                    battlement meanders which in their crossings form a swastika pattern; small
                    squares are inserted into the interstices. Diamond-shaped cores fill the
                    individual fields of the net-pattern. The tongue-pattern consists of a thin,
                    filigree-like outer border and a solid, broad and elongated U-shaped design
                    within. <hi rend="ital">Added red:</hi> the top of the lip is
                    covered with red and a double fillet encircles the body just below the handle
                    attachment.</p>
                <p>The shape of the vessel with its solid, rotund members and the
                    careful modelling of individual parts bespeak its Late Archaic date. The
                    modelling of the snakes, the form of the handle, the shape of the mouth, neck
                    and shoulder correspond very closely to <rs type="vase">Villa

                            painted articulation of the snake-heads is so alieke that it suggests
                            that one artist is responsible for both vases; the very similar
                            appearance of the tongue patterns and the rays further supports this..."

                    Missouri-Columbia; Museum Purchase (59.56).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 4.4 cm; d. of body 6.5
                    cm; d. of mouth 1.7 cm. Intact, but foot, mouth and lower edge of tubular rim
                    chipped; surface scratched and chipped. Reddish brown, micaceous clay, white
                    grit. Remains of black matter inside. Disk foot, concave underneath and with
                    outer face bevelled, set off from body by slight groove. Globular body with
                    steeply sloping shoulder. Small, round mouth sloping inwards and with deep,
                    tubular rim.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Decorated with bands of
                    black glaze, one on lower section of outer face of foot, four on body; mouth
                    reserved, tubular rim black. Traces of ochre wash on reserved band of outer face
                    of foot.</p>
                <p>The tubular rim, designed to prevent liquid from spilling, indicates
                    the function of this little vase. Ink, both black and red, was used in the
                    ancient Mediterranean world. Black ink was made from soot mixed with gum and had
                    to be ground and mixed with water or vinegar before use. Red ink was made from
                    cinnabar. Several examples of terracotta and lead inkwells from the Hellenistic
                    period are known, some with penholders attached. These are all more spherical in
                    shape than the Missouri inkwell. Inkwells from the Roman period also exist.
                    These usually have a flat or slightly concave top with small mouth and sometimes
                    a tubular rim. A date for the Missouri inkwell is difficult to establish. The
                    shape seems to be unparalleled, and the banded decoration can not provide a
                    close date since banded vases have been found in the Athenian Agora dating from
                    the sixth to the fourth centuries. See <bibl>Agora
                        XII, nos. 85 (sixth century), 254 (sixth century), 918 (fourth
                    century)</bibl>. Banded decoration is, however, more common in the sixth and
                    early fifth centuries (<bibl>Agora XII, p.
                    18</bibl>), and a date in the Archaic period has, therefore, been suggested.</p>
                <p>If correctly dated, the Missouri inkwell seems to be the earliest one
                    so far published. Erik Sj√∂qvist (<hi rend="ital">infra</hi>)
                    suggested that some fourth century double vases from Olynthos might have served
                    as inkstands, and some little pots thought to be for ink in solid form and
                    dating to the late fifth century were discovered on a shipwreck off the coast of
                    Italy (<bibl>Eiseman 1975</bibl>). These have a
                    mouth wide enough to allow solid ink to be scooped out, after which it would
                    have been ground and mixed with water in another vessel. Two inkstands from
                    Morgantina of the Hellenistic period illustrate the type of bowl which was used
                    for grinding and mixing ink (<bibl>Sj√∂qvist,
                            <title>infra</title></bibl>). Any small bowl would
                    presumably have been suitable for this purpose. Several small bowls and
                    so-called saltcellars have been found in the Athenian Agora (<bibl
                       >Agora XII, nos. 843-956</bibl>). One, number 915, still had
                    remains of cinnabar inside. Although lacking the broad bases of the Morgantina
                    example, some of them might have served as inkstands. They would not, however,
                    have been suitable for storing liquid ink, whereas the small mouth of the
                    Missouri inkwell could easily have been closed. For recent discussions of
                    containers for ink and references to ancient inks and to other inkwells,
                    inkstands and inkpots, see <bibl>Eiseman 1975,

                    some spherical ones with incised net-patterns. See <bibl

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. to rim 20.5 cm; h. to
                    top of handle 24.4 cm; max. d. 11.6 cm at 11.0 cm from base; d. of base 8.1 cm;
                    h. of base 0.7 cm. Broken into many pieces and mended. Some small missing pieces
                    restored with plaster. Some relief lines restored, as on the underpart of the
                    right chiton sleeve, and parts on the right hand. The glaze is good, but thin in
                    places, and discolored, especially to right of figure; the wash over the
                    reserved areas fired very red. The oinochoe is of shape 1, with trefoil lip, a
                    ring molding articulating join of short neck with plump body, a narrow collar
                    joining body to flat disk foot of two narrow degrees. Inside of mouth to neck is
                    black; surface and upper edge of foot are black, sides and underneath reserved;
                    the handle is all black. The vase is all curves: sections of various curvature
                    compose handle, lip, neck and foot, which, with the larger curves of the body,
                    are echoed in the floral decoration around the handle and sides of the vase.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Just above the join of
                    neck and body is a band of egg decoration, just below, tongues, which are broken
                    by a reserved area on the body between handle-root and neck. Below the figure,
                    extending only to the floral pattern is a key pattern, running left. The floral:
                    below the handle a pendent palmette with ribbed, angled, central leaf springs
                    from two volutes from which tendrils branch out to each side, each giving off
                    and encircling a large palmette before terminating in another palmette which
                    flanks the handle one. The circling tendrils each further branch to give off and
                    encircle two more large palmettes on each side, ending in elaborate
                    double-blossomed lotus-buds which flank the figure on the front. There are
                    slight variations in the composition of the lotuses, but a black palmette is
                    painted in the middle of each bud.</p>
                <p>The single figure on the vase is a maenad. She walks right, looking
                    back over her shoulder, in the crook of her right arm a thyrsos held at a slight
                    angle. Over her chiton she wears a fawn-skin, the leg of which, from behind her
                    left side, just about parallels the angle of her thyrsos. The vase is all
                    curves, but straight lines dominate the figure; the fawn-skin in front hangs
                    straight, the groups of chiton-pleats below her waist hang straight.</p>
                <p>She moves calmly but holds up her left arm, the chiton wrapped around
                    her hand in a gesture known from the so-called "wing-dance." Perhaps she is
                    giving the signal to the <hi rend="ital">thiasos</hi>, the crowd of
                    Dionysos' followers, to start the dance. The branches and leaves of the thyrsos
                    are painted in, in red; wound twice about her head is a painted band, tied in a
                    bow at the back; on her right arm is a bracelet. The staff of the thyrsos is
                    colored with thin glaze, as is the fawn skin and some of its spots, some parts
                    of the hair, and the narrow pleats of the chiton. There is relief outline
                    everywhere, except perhaps the tip of the chiton over the left hand. The
                    thickness of the relief line varies wildly. Sketch lines are visible for some
                    palmette leaves and for lines indicating legs under the skirt.</p>
                <p>An inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, in red paint, runs from left of thyrsos over the head of
                    the maenad. Under the left arm, just below a small restored patch, is another
                    painted mark, probably a letter but without any obvious meaning or connection.</p>
                <p>This vase, itself not without charm, demonstrates rather nicely the
                    information which can be garnered from the often dull minutiae of scholarship.
                    With detail such as floral patterns, rendering of drapery, vase-shape (as also,
                    for instance, in the case of the Syleus Painter, <rs type="vase"
                        >Kansas City 30.13</rs>, or the Painter of Palermo 4, <rs type="vase"
                       >Madison 1976.143</rs>) the net is drawn tighter and tighter
                    until a fairly clear idea of the working organization of Athenian craftsmen
                    takes shape. The Terpaulos Painter is late-found, and not himself of particular
                    interest. Although certain of his few vases were known and published earlier, he
                    first seems to have been given his name, from the flute-playing satyr on an
                    oinochoe in Rome (<bibl>ARV2, 308, no. 1</bibl>), in
                    a short note by Beazley on his inscriptions (<hi rend="ital"
                    >AJA</hi> 61 [1957] 6, no. X11). A neck-amphora, <rs type="vase"
                        >Berlin inv. 1966.19</rs>, signed by one of the "Pioneers" of the red-figure
                    technique (see <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                    1967.115.1</rs>), also has a flute-playing satyr, and the inscription
                    "Terpaulos" (<bibl>Para., 323</bibl>). Only three
                    vases are certainly attributed to the Terpaulos Painter, and two including the
                    one in St. Louis, are "probably" his. The three certain attributions are
                    oinochoai of a different shape from this, with a lower handle and broader base,
                    but all four oinochoai have single figures decorating the vase: a satyr
                    (Terpaulos), a victor, a warrior, the St. Louis maenad. The fifth vase, a
                    lekythos (<bibl>ARV2, 308, no. 5</bibl>), has a
                    chariot scene with warriors arming (cf. <rs type="vase">Cleveland
                        28.660</rs>) and floral on the shoulder. Shape, subject matter, and floral
                    of that vase, together with the decorative scheme and floral of the St. Louis
                    vase, relate the artist to certain contemporary black-figure lekythos painters,
                    the Sappho and Diosphos Painters (see <rs type="vase">Columbia
                        58.12</rs>), and to the Kleophrades Painter (<bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 78</bibl>) and the Berlin Painter (<rs
                        type="vase">Ann Arbor 70.1.1</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >Champaign 70.8.6</rs>) (<bibl>Kurtz
                        1975, 80</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Beazley, evidently in a personal communication to Mylonas (<bibl
                       >Mylonas 1940, p. 211</bibl>), compared the
                    maenad's chiton with drapery on a fragment in Oxford by an artist of the Syleus
                    Sequence, the Diogenes Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 248, no.
                        5</bibl>), presumably referring to the V-shaped join of the chiton sleeve,
                    bordered by several parallel wavy lines (and best seen on the Dionysos of a
                    fragment, <rs type="vase">T√ºbingen E 15</rs>, from the same
                    vase, <hi rend="ital">ibid</hi>). Another pattern in the rendering
                    of drapery which is common among painters of the Syleus Sequence, and in
                    contemporary vase-painting in general, is the widely spaced groups of vertical
                    pleats in the chiton of the St. Louis maenad. It occurs also in the drapery of
                    figures on an amphora, <rs type="vase">London E 265</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 1594</bibl>). the neck-floral of this
                    amphora is closely related to that of the St. Louis oinochoe in the multiple
                    calyxes and the black palmettes of the lotus buds in each (<bibl
                       >Jacobsthal 1927, p. 167, in note 315 to p. 166, and p.
                    172</bibl>). The St. Louis vase is called a "side-palmette" vase from the
                    disposition of the floral decoration (<bibl>Kurtz
                        1975, 80</bibl>).</p>

                    behind the helmet of the warrior. The inscriptions are without meaning.</p>
                <p>In terms of iconography and composition, one is reminded strongly of
                    the battling figures from the pediments of the temple of Aphaia at Aegina, which
                    are contemporary with this vase. The last quarter of the sixth century was
                    characterized by conceptual advancements in the treatment of the human figure,
                    spatially and naturalistically. It was a period of experimentation with artistic
                    techniques which could facilitate these objectives; namely, the use of bronze in
                    rendering three-dimensional figures on a large scale, and the introduction of
                    the red-figure technique in vase-painting. This vase was decorated by the
                    Diosphos Painter, a black-figurist, and it is painted in an unusual technique
                    related to black-figure, called Six's technique after the Dutch scholar, Jan
                    Six, who first studied it. The range of added color is broad and the color is
                    applied with a brush to the surface of the vase, which has been coated with
                    black-glaze matter. Like black-figure, many details are incised (<bibl
                       >Noble 1965, 66</bibl>). The style of such vases
                    is fetching, intentionally decorative and pleasing.</p>
                <p>The light-colored areas on this lekythos, like red-figure itself,
                    utilize the natural spatial advantage and added animation that any lighter
                    elements have against a dark background. Even within an uncommon type, this vase
                    is unusual; the fallen male is depicted in lighter color, recalling red-figure,
                    while the striding male is in "Six" black. Significantly, the fully developed
                    Six's technique as shown on this vase may give some reflection of the richness
                    of wall painting of the period, with regard to color. If spatial concerns were
                    important to the artist ‚Äî he does try to foreshorten the body of the
                    fallen warrior ‚Äî his success is ambiguous. The sculptors of the earlier
                    Aegina pediment had a similar interest in space and equal difficulty in
                    achieving it. Although the lighter painted portions of the figures on the
                    Missouri lekythos stand away from the black field and take on added life, the
                    figure of the striding warrior, insofar as he shares the same black as the field
                    and is too indistinctly separated from it, appears anchored and flat. Like a
                    specter in negative, his foot, in black, seems to cut the lighter body of the
                    fallen warrior in half, obviously, as Kurtz implies (<bibl
                       >Kurtz 1975, p. 119</bibl>) for decorative effect. The
                    Diosphos Painter used other experimental techniques, a semi-outline technique
                    for instance, apparently toward similar ends.</p>
                <p>"The Diosphos Painter's use of Six's technique is similar to his use
                    of semi-outline; just as he liked to balance light (outline) and dark
                    (silhouette) on white ground, he likes to balance dark (incised) and light
                    (added color) on black" (<bibl>Kurtz 1975, p.
                    119</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Missouri lekythos is remarkable for its extremely fine state of
                    preservation and for its style which provides valuable opportunity to view
                    something of an eleventh-hour attempt on the part of a still gifted
                    black-figurist to revitalize his craft in the face of the ever-increasing
                    popularity of red-figure painting.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 15.0 cm; d. of body
                    15.5 cm. Intact. Some repainting where original slip has flaked off; left hand
                    of warrior and center of bow missing. Creamy-white slip, neck black, lip
                    reserved; black band above figure with thin reddish line above and below,
                    reddish line under feet.</p>
                <p>The slender vessel with narrow neck and flattened rim, originally
                    derived from Egyptian stone vases, is used in Greece as a small container
                    designed to hold perfume, oil, or some other valuable substance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> A negro warrior stands
                    with outstretched arms, his body frontal, head turned to the left, feet facing
                    right. The head with its characteristic negroid features is disproportionately
                    small for the tall, bulky body; the hair is in the ground color, outlined with
                    black dots to suggest its curly texture. The man wears striped trousers and a
                    long-sleeved upper garment, but the latter is covered by a sleeveless cuirass in
                    which the lines of the <hi rend="ital">pteryges</hi> are
                    conspicuous. Below it a flaring, scallop-edged area must represent the <hi
                        rend="ital">chitoniskos</hi> which hoplites commonly wear under
                    a cuirass. A scarf loops behind the body, its ends hanging over the arms. The
                    right hand holds an axe, the left a bow. On one side of the warrior is a simple
                    table, on the other a palm tree.</p>
                <p>The draftsmanship is not good, with thick and often irregular brush
                    strokes; the figure, ill-proportioned with the peculiarity of feet pointing one
                    way and head looking the other, is awkward. There is little attempt at an
                    integrated design; man, tree, and table are simply spread over the surface. The
                    scene is static.</p>
                <p>The Krannert vase and the alabastron owned by Prof. and Mrs. Boulter
                        (<bibl>Moon 1979, no. 85</bibl>) are examples of
                    a small but consistent group of alabastra. The black warrior is always in the
                    same pose, but details of his costume vary slightly, table and palm tree are
                    common but not ubiquitous; as on the Boulter vase, a helmet or <hi rend="ital"
                       >gorytos</hi> (the combination quiver/bowcase used by the
                    Persians) can be added. The addition of the hoplite cuirass and <hi rend="ital"
                       >chitoniskos</hi> to the sleeved tunic/trousers combination
                    looks peculiar, but also occurs occasionally on Amazons; where the draftsmanship
                    is better than in the negro group, the details of the armor are clear. The
                    tunic/trousers costume without armor is standard in Greek art for barbarians,
                    real or mythical: Persians, Scythians, Trojans and Amazons. It was actually worn
                    by some peoples of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, and at least East Greeks must
                    have been familiar with the costume even before the Persian Wars. The weapons
                    carried by the black warrior, axe and bow, are typical for Amazons but can be
                    used by other barbarians. The palm tree may be an allusion to the tropical land
                    to which black men are indigenous, but the reason for the table is obscure;
                    occasionally it holds an object but more commonly, as here, it is bare.</p>
                <p>The ethnic origin of the warrior is uncertain. The racial type is
                    that of inhabitants of the Sudan, in antiquity usually called Ethiopians.
                    Although Herodotus (<bibl n="Hdt. 7.69">Hdt.
                    7.69</bibl>) says that Ethiopians wore garments of lion or leopard-skin, the
                    close-fitting costume depicted here would scarcely be worn in a hot climate. A.
                    D. Fraser suggests these warriors are the so-called "eastern Ethiopians" from
                    India or Baluchistan, but those peoples are not negroid. In any case it is
                    unlikely that Greek artists were concerned with anthropological accuracy.</p>
                <p>Beazley has identified the "Group of the Negro Alabastra," but the
                    close similarity in subject and drawing technique among the vases suggests they
                    are the work of a single hand; hence we prefer "Painter of the Negro Alabastra."
                    Beazley's derivation from the school of the Syriskos Painter seems untenable in
                    view of the differences in style between his works and those of the "Group of
                    the Negro Alabastra."</p>
                <p>Fraser believes the group dates from after the Persian Wars since he
                    is convinced the men depicted are mercenaries in the Persian army but, as stated
                    above, this is not necessarily so since Greeks were familiar with the costume
                    before that time. From the seventh century on, the Greeks had lived in Egypt and
                    knew the negroid physical type. The form of the vessel indicates a date before
                    the appearance of the sharp-shouldered, flatter-rimmed type of alabastron used
                    by the Diosphos Painter in the early fifth century, and a date of around 500
                    B.C. for the Negro Group is reasonable. For Negro alabastra: <bibl

                    suggested that this particular group, which has figures drawn in a quick,

                    12.5 cm. Mended and restored, small repairs. Portions of cup and right side of
                    head restored. Surface worn and chipped in several places, particularly on the
                    foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> This vase is formed of
                    a wheel-made lip attached to a mold-formed lower portion in the shape of the
                    head of a black female. She is depicted with her mouth partially open and her
                    hair, wrapped in a sakkos, protrudes in a roll over her forehead. The whole vase
                    is covered with a shiny black glaze of good quality, with the exception of the
                    lips which are reserved. Incision was used to indicate the pupils of the eyes,
                    the ears, and, by parallel undulating lines, the forehead hair. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Added white:</hi> now mostly faded or partially missing, was
                    used for the whites of the eyes, the outline of the sakkos behind the forehead
                    hair and the teeth. The lip is encircled by a white wreath made of long leaves
                    (perhaps a myrtle wreath shown tied in front). <hi rend="ital"
                        >Added red:</hi> preserved only in traces on the tongue between the teeth,
                    and probably applied in the nostrils as well. Although no traces survive, the
                    lips may also have been red.</p>
                <p>Attic plastic head-vases of the sixth and fifth centuries have been
                    classified by Beazley on the basis of their molded portions. This example
                    belongs to the London Class, named after a kantharos in London in the form of
                    white women's heads. The class also includes oinochoai and mugs. Dionysos is a
                    common subject, as well as both black and white women, sometimes arranged back
                    to back (janiform).</p>
                <p>The significance of the subjects chosen by the artist for a head-vase
                    is still unclear despite numerous suggestions. The religious significance of the
                    vessel type is now generally de-emphasized and the popularity of Dionysos and
                    his female followers is seen as appropriate rather than cultic. There were
                    relatively few head-vases and they were no doubt novelty and luxury items,
                    probably of some snob value. The use of the head of a black for the body of many
                    of these plastic vessels may be have no more significance than that of a topical
                    reference, as souvenir-mugs in the form of human faces have today. There is no
                    doubt, however, that, as Beazley pointed out, the nature of the Attic black
                    glaze was particularly suited to the rendering of this subject.</p>
                <p>Head-vases represent a marriage of the technique of the potter to
                    that of the clay modeller, or coroplast. Although apparently never a truly
                    successful union, it was tried out in this form throughout history in many
                    different cultures.</p>

                    Michigan, Ann Arbor (70.1.1). Said to be from Bolsena. Ex Schweizer Collection,
                    Arlesheim.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 12.3 cm; d. of mouth
                    32.9 cm; w. handle to handle 41.6 cm; d. of foot 12.3 cm; d. of resting surface
                    11.8 cm; d. of tondo 12.5 cm. Broken and repaired, with much repainting over the
                    black areas. Where it remains, the original black is of very good quality. Much
                    of the rim is painted over, so that it is hard to tell if it was not once
                    reserved. It probably was not. Parts of the pithos handle in the picture are
                    restored. There is an indentation on the inside center of the cup where it joins
                    the foot. The kylix is of type B, where the profile of cup and stem forms a
                    continuous curve. A slight ridge on the upper surface of the foot breaks the
                    curve as if to mark the point where the weight of the cup falls. The disk of the
                    base is narrowly inset at the upper edge, and below, where the resting surface
                    is formed; the stem is hollow inside, up to a nippled surface about 5.5 cm from
                    the bottom of the foot. The outside of the cup is all black except for three
                    areas, each of which visually serves to bind one part of the vase to another:
                    the inside of each handle, including the body of the vase between the roots, and
                    the outside of the base together with the resting surface underneath. Elsewhere,
                    the underside is painted shiny black up to the hollow cylinder of the stem,
                    which is reserved inside.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Inside, the cup is
                    black except for the picture in the tondo. Within a reserved circle, a naked
                    young man is shown supporting himself by two overhead straps, leaving his feet
                    free to work in a large jar (pithos); he is crushing grapes. The outline of the
                    head is incised. Around the entire hair-line are raised dots to indicate curls,
                    some laid over the incised outline. Around his head is a wreath in red paint.
                    The pithos is shown with handle toward the viewer. There are indications that a
                    painted circle might have lined the inner side of the reserved border. Sketch
                    lines are visible for the circular border of the tondo, and sketch lines
                    indicate that the left side of the pithos rim was first begun a little further
                    to the left. The broad preliminary contour is visible everywhere. There is
                    relief outline everywhere but on a small part of the right hand along the little
                    finger and palm; there seems to have been none around the circular border.
                    Dilute glaze is used for inner markings on the torso.</p>

                <p>The painter of this cup was working around the turn of the sixth
                    century, at the same time as the Chaire Painter, who did the cup from
                    Indianapolis with the long-backed woman at a pithos (<rs type="vase"
                       >Indianapolis 47.37</rs>). They were of the same milieu,
                    painters working in the tradition of the Nikosthenes Painter (see <rs
                        type="vase">Kansas City 52.22</rs>, and <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 69</bibl>) making vases for the less luxurious
                    table. The alabastron by the Painter of Berlin 2268, <rs type="vase"
                       >University of Chicago 1967.115.243</rs>, is from the same
                    group, and so is a cup in the Art Institute in the manner of the Epileios
                    Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 148, no. 4</bibl>), and another
                    in his manner in East Lansing, Michigan State University (<bibl
                       >Para., 335 below</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Pictures showing a figure at a large vessel were popular at the time
                    ‚Äî one painter, the Pithos Painter, was so named for his frequent use of
                    the subject. The Indianapolis lady was probably washing clothes or her self, but
                    our young man is working at the vintage, involved in the process of oxygenating
                    the fermenting wine, according to Jehasse (<hi rend="ital"
                    >infra,</hi> p. 3f). More extensive pictures of the vintage, usually performed
                    by satyrs from the retinue of the wine-god, Dionysos, include figures engaged in
                    similar activities. Pithoi of the type shown are thought to be forerunners of
                    the bell-krater shape (see <rs type="vase">Chicago 1922.2197</rs>).</p>
                <p>Our painter has not yet been identified, but such traits as the short
                    horizontal line below the join of the breast lines and the voluted ear may help
                    to pin him down. The outline of his hair, incised instead of reserved, speaks
                    for a painter still in touch with the black-figure tradition. Beazley compared
                    the cup with one inscribed "Leagros Kalos," now in Hamburg, and the Hamburg cup
                    with another bearing the inscription "Leagros Kalos" and the signature of the
                    potter Kachrylion (ARV2, <hi rend="ital">infra</hi>, and <bibl
                       >Para., 507, above</bibl>). The foot of the Ann
                    Arbor cup, with its slight ridge breaking the spread of the upper surface, the
                    narrow insets around the edges of the disk, the proportions of disk and stem, is
                    similar to that of a cup made by Kachrylion, <rs type="vase">London
                        E 40</rs>. It is similar also, though somewhat less so, to those of
                    so-called <hi rend="ital">"reichen"</hi> foot-profile, as for
                    example <rs type="vase">Munich 2618</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >London E 16</rs>. All three were painted by Oltos (see <bibl

                        14, 1 and 2</bibl>). The nipple at the top of the inside of the hollow stem
                    occurs on a cup made by the potter Pamphaios and painted by Epiktetos, <rs

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 7.2 to 7.6 cm; d. of
                    rim 18.5 cm; w. handle to handle 24.8 cm; d. of tondo 10.4 cm; d. of foot 8.3
                    cm; h. of foot 0.6 cm. Broken and mended: stem broken from cup, cup broken in
                    half between handles, chips at rim around break restored. In the drawing, relief
                    outline is abraded at lower lip and chin and on the bordering circle in lower
                    right of pithos body; possibly the line of upper lip is restored. The cup is of
                    type B with cup and stem forming a continuous curve. A shallow step divides the
                    spreading surface of the foot. The insides of the handles and the vase wall
                    between and over the roots of each are reserved; turned step of foot, outside of
                    foot disk, outer edge underneath foot are reserved. The rest of the vase outside
                    and underneath is black. Red wash covers the reserved areas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The cup is decorated
                    only on the inside. The picture is one with its setting; it is all curves, like
                    the cup itself, and, like rim and foot of the cup, only the rim of the pithos in
                    the picture is straight and angled. Even the placement of the picture is at a
                    slight angle to the horizontal between the handles. The light and dark curves of
                    the handles anchor the wide black band around the narrow reserved circle which
                    borders the tondo. Inside, a naked woman, her hair covered with a sakkos, kneels
                    before a large vessel, a pithos, only part of which is shown. The long curve of
                    her back follows the curve of the border and an inscription, in red, reading
                    left to right from her hip to her shoulder, follows the curve of her back. She
                    wears a necklace, done in thin glaze, and a red-painted wreath about her head
                    over the sakkos. An incised "V" outlines the hair over her forehead. A line,
                    which appears to be red paint, passes from the pithos rim across her right thigh
                    and leg, for no apparent purpose; wash may have collected in a scratch.<note
                        place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                        <p>"The naked hetaira has dipped a bucket or pitcher into the
                            pithos; the red line is a string or cord that passes the rim and her
                            right leg." (Letter of Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb.
                            1980)</p>
                    </note> Thin glaze is used for the muscle of the buttock and for pubic hair. The
                    black of the background was laid on sloppily in places, leaving visible a sort
                    of dull glaze line bordering the reserved circle.</p>
                <p>No sketch marks are visible except possibly one inside the line of
                    the lower back of the figure. The broad preliminary contour is visible only
                    above the sakkos. There is relief outline everywhere, in some places veering
                    wildly from the line of figure: at top of sakkos, at upper back, at nose. In the
                    last two places it has been applied again over the actual profile of the figure.
                    The relief line is unevenly applied, very thick in places, thin in others. The
                    inscription: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*A*I*R*I</foreign>
                    (hail).</p>
                <p>The Chaire Painter is one of Beazley's "Coarser" early red-figure cup
                    painters who "continue the Nikosthenic tradition" (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Ann Arbor 70.1.1</rs>,and <rs type="vase"
                        >University of Chicago 1967.115.243</rs>). Five of some ten cups attributed
                    to him have the inscription <hi rend="ital">chaire,</hi> "hail" or
                    "hi!" from which he takes his name. He paints only the insides of his cups, most
                    of which show a single figure with some sort of large vase, like cups by his
                    contemporary, the Pithos Painter. The young man crushing grapes in a pithos on
                    the Michigan kylix, <rs type="vase">Ann Arbor 70.1.1</rs>, is also
                    contemporary.</p>

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; gift of E. P. Warren (1967.115.243, formerly UC 346).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 15.8 cm; d. of top 4.4
                    cm; w. 5.2 cm. Intact except for a repaired break at the lip and some scratches
                    and chips on the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Sides A and B:</hi> peltasts. On each side a
                    light-armed warrior runs toward the right, looking round. Each wears a cap <hi
                        rend="ital">(kidareis)</hi> and carries a crescent-shaped
                    pelta. There is little difference between the two. The shield-device on A is an
                    eye flanked by two circles, on B, a phallus. On the observe a band encircles the
                    peltast's cap near its peak. On the reverse the nose and mouth of the warrior
                    are obscured by his left shoulder. His right fist is clenched; on A the
                    warrior's right hand disappears behind his body. <hi rend="ital">On
                        the bottom:</hi> black palmette. The picture zone is bounded by two bands of
                    ornament above: tongue-pattern and chevron-pattern, and by a single band below:
                    net-pattern. All ornament is painted in black glaze on a reserved ground.</p>
                <p>It has long been recognized that the alabastron in the collection of
                    The University of Chicago is by a "minor artist" (<bibl
                       >J. D. Beazley, <title>Greek22 Vases in
                        Poland</title> [Oxford 1928] 15</bibl>), whose works are insignificant
                        (<bibl>Beazley 1925, 46</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Johnson 1938, p. 345</bibl>). His name, Painter
                    of Berlin 2268, is derived from a cup (<rs type="vase">Berlin F
                        2268</rs>; <bibl>ARV2, 153, no. 2</bibl>) ‚Äî
                     a more ambitious work than the Chicago vase. Nevertheless, for a number of
                    reasons, this alabastron is an important surviving document.</p>
                <p>The Painter of Berlin 2268 must have found peltasts easy to draw; he
                    repeats them on mugs, oinochoai of shape 8A (e.g. Italy, private collection,
                        <bibl>ARV2, 156, no. 54</bibl>; New York, von
                    Bothmer [once Philadelphia Market], <bibl>ARV2,
                        1629, no. 57</bibl>
                    <hi rend="ital">bis.</hi>). The eye is his favorite device for the
                    pelta (e.g. <rs type="vase">New York 06.1021.170</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 155, no. 38</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >RISD 25.073</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 157,
                        no. 88</bibl>). The phallus on the pelta of Side B is an unusual device for
                    this painter, but nonetheless characteristic of his imagination ‚Äî on a
                    mug, <rs type="vase">Berlin F 2320</rs>, (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 157, no. 84</bibl>) he has drawn a phallus-horse.</p>
                <p>Works of art from ancient Greece, such as the Chicago alabastron,
                    provide our only visual record of peltae. These small shields were made of
                    perishable materials (generally with a wood or wicker frame covered with animal
                    skins), and none have survived. (<bibl>Snodgrass
                        1967, 78</bibl>). The pelta was Thracian in origin; even in Athens,
                    therefore, it was associated with the exotic cap, worn by both of the
                    light-armed warriors on the Chicago alabastron. The Spartan poet, Tyrtaeus,
                    wrote of the traditional weapons of the light-armed: stones and javelins (<bibl
                        n="Tyrtaeus fr. 11, 1.25">Tyrtaeus fr. 11,
                    1.25</bibl>; <bibl><title>Loeb,
                            Greek Elegy and Iambus,</title> v. 1, pp. 74-75</bibl>). The peltasts on
                    the von Bothmer mug <hi rend="ital">(supra)</hi> hurl stones; those
                    on the Chicago alabastron tense their right arms as if carrying javelins, but
                    hold none. Perhaps, in his haste, the careless painter neglected to provide
                    these warriors with weapons.</p>
                <p>Small oil flasks, such as the Chicago alabastron, were hung from
                    leather thongs, attached to lugs near the vessels' tops; thus suspended they
                    were easily carried about (<bibl>Haspels 1936, 101
                        and n. 2</bibl>). Since these vases were not designed to stand, their
                    rounded bottoms were suitable fields for decoration. A handful of other
                    alabastra by the Painter of Berlin 2268 is known (Athens, Vlasto, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 157, no. 86</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >RISD 25.073</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 157,
                        no. 88</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Lausanne, private
                    collection</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 1629, no. 85
                    bis</bibl>, <bibl>Para., 336</bibl>; Basel, Bloch,
                        <bibl>ARV2, 1629, no. 85 ter</bibl>; <rs
                        type="vase">Kavala A 1078</rs>, <bibl
                       >Para., 336, no. 88 bis</bibl>). Of these, the Chicago
                    alabastron alone has a black palmette on its bottom. This palmette, as well as
                    the rest of the vase's ornament is in black silhouette ‚Äî painted in black
                    glaze upon a reserved ground. Unlike true black-figure, in black silhouette
                    there is no incision or added-color. In the early red-figure period it is not
                    unusual for vases with pictures in the new technique to have ornament in
                    black-figure or black silhouette (e.g. <rs type="vase">Louvre G
                    I</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 3, no. 2</bibl>; <rs type="vase"
                       >New York 14.146.1</rs>, <bibl>ARV2,
                        8, no. 9</bibl>). This opposition of new and old in figural decoration and
                    ornament is especially common on the alabastra of the Paidikos Group (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 98-101</bibl>), so-called after a potter
                    with that name, or nickname (<bibl>ARV2,
                    102</bibl>). In the Paidikos Group, as well, a black palmette on the
                    alabastron-bottom is a common scheme (e.g. <rs type="vase"
                        >Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg, inv. 2661</rs>, <bibl
                        >ARV2, 100, no. 14</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Cambridge
                    37.39</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 100, no. 15</bibl>; Armonk,
                    Pinney, <bibl>ARV2, 100, no. 25</bibl>). Sometimes
                    this palmette is translated into red-figure (e.g. <rs type="vase"
                        >Louvre CA 487</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 99, no.
                    9</bibl>; <rs type="vase">London 1902.12-18.2</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 99, no. 7</bibl>). On other alabastra even
                    more techniques have been combined ‚Äî white ground decoration on their
                    bodies and either red-figure palmettes, or black palmettes against reserved, or
                    even white grounds on their bottoms (e.g. <rs type="vase">T√º
                        bingen E 48</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 100, no.
                    28</bibl>; <rs type="vase">Louvre CA 1920</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 99, no. 3</bibl>; <rs type="vase">New York
                        21.80</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 99, no. 5</bibl>; <rs
                        type="vase">New York 06.1021.92</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 99, no. 6</bibl>). The Paidikos Group is related to the
                    Euergides Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 98-99</bibl>), who in
                    turn is related to the Epeleios Painter (<bibl>ARV2,
                        104, 146-148</bibl>). Some vases near the Epeleios Painter in style are the
                    same in shape as vases decorated by the Painter of Berlin 2268 (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 152 and 158</bibl>). The Chicago
                    alabastron must be a distant relative of the Paidikos Group, and it certainly
                    expresses the spirit of the time when red-figure was still new and black-figure
                    tradition still strong.</p>

                    </note> Both vase and cover are much broken, pieced, and abraded. The top of the
                    knob on the cover is broken away. Missing parts are restored with plaster.
                    Cracks across both pictures take away parts of palmette borders, and sections
                    through all figures: on obverse, principally a horizontal section through head
                    of old man, with part of ear and eye, parts of Athena's nose, eye, mouth, chin,
                    and the join of her spear-head and shaft, a line across nose and ear of warrior
                    at right; on reverse, principally parts of right hand of satyr at left, a large
                    part of Dionysos' face, with eye, ear, lower head, neck and shoulder, patches on
                    forehead and cheek of satyr at right, a large section through his leopard skin
                    below right arm, and a line through his breast. The firing of the vase is
                    uneven; the black on the foot was fired red, the rays above the foot also,
                    especially on the reverse. There are numerous black splotches on the foot and
                    the underside of the cover. The amphora is of type A, with neck and body forming
                    a continuous curve, with flaring rim, and flanged handles. The rim is reserved
                    on top, black outside; black was carelessly laid on underneath. Inside, the
                    mouth is black to above 4.5 cm down; below this the neck is thinly glazed; the
                    pot is matt black inside. A narrow band separates the body from the foot, which
                    is composed of two degrees, the upper narrow and with angular profile, the lower
                    large and torus-shaped. The foot was meant to be black, with a narrow band left
                    reserved around the lower edge; underneath it is reserved. The handles are black
                    outside, the edges once painted red; the sides are decorated with black ivy on a
                    reserved background; the inside of one handle is mostly black, of the other
                    mostly reserved. A deep red wash was used on all the reserved areas outside. The
                    cover is pyramidal, with a knob in the form of a pomegranate. It is mostly
                    black, except for a ring of rays around the top at the base of the knob and a
                    black ivy wreath on the recessed, reserved outer edge. The stem of the knob is
                    also reserved, with a red painted line encircling it. A red line is painted
                    around the outside of the rays, and the rim outside is painted red. The cover is
                    reserved inside. All the reserved areas outside and the flange which fits into
                    the vase itself are covered with red wash.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> There is a red painted
                    line around the outer edge of the vase rim, a red line around the neck where the
                    handles meet it, one above the picture frame on each side, from handle to
                    handle, two red lines running all around the pot under the picture, one above
                    the rays decorating the vase above its join with the foot. The pictures, obverse
                    and reverse, are framed by chains of double palmettes above, pomegranate-net at
                    the sides, simple key running left below. These black designs on a reserved
                    background join together with the ivy rows on the outside surfaces of the
                    handles to bind the vase shape to the figured scene, just as the red lines
                    encircling the cover are paralleled in red lines at neck, picture frame, and
                    rays when red painted rims of vase and cover are joined. Rays at top of cover
                    echo rays about foot, as ivy of cover echoes ivy of handles, and the pomegranate
                    knob finds its complement in the pomegranate design of the picture frame.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> An old man, dressed in
                    chiton and himation, walking stick in left hand, raises his right hand in
                    greeting to Athena, who turns her head toward him. They are flanked by warriors,
                    one on each side. The goddess dominates the picture, the crest of her helmet and
                    the head of her spear protruding into the floral border above, aegis and
                    himation displayed in full frontal sweep as she holds a phiale high across her
                    chest in her right hand and delicately balances her planted spear with her left.
                    The darkbordered folds of her himation, elaborate and symmetrical, bounded by
                    the horizontals of her arm above and the narrow black lines through her chiton
                    below, emphasize the severe verticals of the composition. A frivolous snake
                    escapes from the aegis at her shoulder, as though to listen to the old man. At
                    her left, from behind, and mirroring the fall of the drapery, four more snakes
                    rear out from the aegis toward the warrior near them. The warriors both are
                    bearded and wear short chiton and cuirass. The one at left wears his Attic
                    helmet, the cheek-piece raised, leans on his spear and holds a leaf out to
                    Athena. The warrior at right dips his leaf into Athena's phiale. He holds his
                    Thracian helmet, his sword hangs in the scabbard at his waist, his shield, seen
                    in three-quarter view, is propped up near him; there is a line, probably an
                    anklet, around his left ankle. Of the shield-device, the forepart of a lion, in
                    black, is visible. Letters on the shield about the edge appear to read "kalos."
                    The old man would seem to have short white hair, with black fringe about the
                    face, and a short dark beard. But his hair, long and done up in a <hi
                        rend="ital">krobylos</hi>, his beard, and the long wavy lock
                    over his shoulder, were painted on in yellowish-white, overlapping the line of
                    head and beard. The gadroons on Athena's phiale are painted alternately red and
                    white, and the leaves held by both warriors were done in added white. There are
                    traces of added paint for a broad band tied around the head of the warrior at
                    right and knotted in back.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> The bearded Dionysos,
                    holding drinking horn and forked branch with red-painted ivy leaves, moves
                    between two satyrs. His hair is done up in a <hi rend="ital"
                        >krobylos</hi> and tied with a band done in red paint, one long end falling
                    over his left shoulder. The sway of his voluminous chiton and himation give the
                    tone to the composition, where the leopard skins of the satyrs flanking him
                    complement the curves and decoration of the ivy-lined handles of the vase
                    itself. On this side, all is curves, on the other, all verticals, but the
                    compositions are similar: the balding satyr at left gestures like the old man on
                    the obverse, the satyr at right, drinking horn in left hand, reaches out to
                    Dionysos just as the warrior on the obverse reaches out to dip his leaf into the
                    phiale. The drinking horns have letters along the surfaces, apparently without
                    meaning. The satyrs wear red-painted ivy wreaths, only traces of which are
                    visible on the one at right.</p>
                <p>Thinned glaze was used for moustaches and fringes of hair, for neck
                    muscles, inner markings of arms and legs, and for ribs of one satyr. There are
                    no marks indicating musculature of satyrs' torsos, but the outlines of their
                    eyes and marks on their cheeks are done in thin glaze. Athena's hair, the snakes
                    of her aegis, the hemline and border of her himation, the lines through her
                    chiton, the pleats of the old man's chiton sleeve, details on Thracian helmet
                    and shield device, inscriptions on shield and drinking horns, all were done in
                    thin glaze. Relief outline was used only for parts of feet, legs, arms, and
                    sporadically for other parts of the body; none for heads, necks, faces, little
                    for hands and garments. Athena's spear, the helmet crest of warrior at right,
                    and part of his sword, the staff of the warrior at left, are outlined in relief.
                    The broad contour line is everywhere visible. On the obverse there are many
                    sketch marks between Athena and the warrior at right. Sketches show that
                    Athena's right arm and hand were started lower, her helmet and forehead farther
                    right, her spear further left. The hair-line over Athena's forehead appears to
                    be incised but it might be a deep sketch mark. There are indications that the
                    orientation of the shield was changed, from in front of the warrior's left leg
                    to its present position. On the reverse, sketch marks show that both satyrs were
                    first meant to have bigger bellies. On both sides sketch marks indicate the
                    position of legs under the drapery. Graffiti underneath the foot, on the curved
                    surface inside: a series of vertical scratches, possibly a failed attempt at the
                    letter next to them, similar to an <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*A</foreign>, to the right of which, a character similar to a <foreign
                        xml:lang="greek">*G</foreign>.</p>
                <p>It is rare that one can remark any aspect of the subject without
                    referring to Sir John Beazley, the great student of Greek vase-painting. The
                    following note traces the stages of his thought on the Syleus Painter as much as
                    it outlines the painter himself. Beazley put together a sequence, detected in
                        <bibl>ARV1</bibl>, made positive in <bibl
                       >ARV2</bibl>, of four painters who might in fact
                    be but stages in the development of one: the earliest, the Painter of the Munich
                    Amphora, then the Gallatin Painter, the Diogenes Painter, and, latest, the
                    Syleus Painter. Our vase first appears in <bibl
                    >ARV1</bibl> (1942), although the Syleus Painter and the Diogenes Painter were
                    individually identified as early as <bibl>Beazley
                        1918</bibl>, where the latter was discussed as contemporary with the
                    Eucharides Painter and Myson, and where the Syleus Painter was seen to have
                    something in common with the Copenhagen and Syriskos Painters. In <bibl
                       >Beazley 1925</bibl> it was noted that the Syleus
                    Painter has something of the force of the Oreithyia Painter, and vases later
                    seen to be his early work were grouped under the "Painter of the W√ºrzburg
                    Athena." There are reflections of the Kleophrades Painter's work (see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 78</bibl>) in the Syleus
                    Painter's predilection for the running key border and in his namepiece, a
                    stamnos (<rs type="vase">Copenhagen inv. 3293</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 251, no. 36</bibl>). This stamnos has
                    Herakles and the badman Syleus on the obverse, on the reverse Dionysos and
                    maenads who recall those on the Kleophrades Painter's great pointed amphora (<rs
                        type="vase">Munich 2344</rs>, <bibl
                        >ARV2, 182, no. 6</bibl>). It is interesting that a pair of pelikai (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 1639, nos. 17 bis and 17 ter</bibl>), made
                    as companion pieces and painted by the Syleus Painter, are supposed to have been
                    found together with stamnoi made by one potter and painted by the Kleophrades
                    Painter and one of his followers (<bibl>ARV2, 1632,
                        below, no. 58</bibl>). Stamnoi by the Painter of the Munich Amphora, the
                    earliest painter of the Syleus sequence, are related to stamnoi by the
                    Tyszkiewicz Painter (<bibl>Philippaki 1967,
                    95ff</bibl>.), and it is significant that a vase once attributed to the
                    Tyszkiewicz Painter is now given to the Diogenes Painter, who precedes the
                    Syleus Painter in the sequence (<bibl>ARV2,
                    1642</bibl> and <bibl>Para., 350, no. 1 bis</bibl>).
                    Several stamnoi by the Syleus Painter (one of which is in Toledo, and fragments
                    of another in The University of Chicago) are of a type painted also by the Siren
                    and the Argos Painters, a type closely related to those of the Tyszkiewicz
                    Painter. A pelike by the Siren Painter and one which recalls the Argos Painter
                    are of the same class as a number of pelikai by the Syleus Painter (<bibl
                       >Philippaki 1967, 97ff., and especially
                    100</bibl>). This then, is his milieu, and these are his contemporaries, all
                    painters of large pots, some of whom he must have worked with in one shop. There
                    is the possibility of a relationship with painters of small vases: Martin
                    Robertson feels that there might be a workshop connection between the Syleus
                    Sequence and the painters of "coarser" cups, from the "wider circle" of the
                    Nikosthenes Painter (<bibl>JHS 76[1956] 133</bibl>;
                    also in <bibl><title>AntK
                        infra,</title> 15</bibl>. Compare <rs type="vase">Ann Arbor
                        70.1.1</rs> and <rs type="vase">Indianapolis 47.37</rs>).</p>
                <p>There are only two type A amphorae known from the Syleus sequence,
                    one the namepiece of the Painter of the Munich Amphora (<rs type="vase"
                       >Munich 2303</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 245,
                        no. 1</bibl>) and this, the Kansas City one. The subsidiary decoration of
                    the two is similar except that the Munich amphora lacks the running key as lower
                    border for the pictures. Both have a Dionysiac scene on the reverse, and a
                    balding satyr wearing panther skin. Dionysiac scenes are common in the Syleus
                    Painter's work (as in contemporary vase-painting generally) for reverses and
                    sometimes for the main scene. The scheme of Athena's drapery on the Kansas City
                    amphora is already present in the drapery of the Munich one, with its symmetric
                    and parallel groupings; it is generally characteristic of the Syleus sequence.
                    The diagonal folds between pleats, typical of the Syleus Painter and best seen
                    here on the drapery of the Dionysos, appear already in the work of the Diogenes
                    Painter (cf. the Athena on his column krater in Leningrad, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 248, no. 1</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Painters of the Syleus sequence like scenes showing gods and
                    heroes; Herakles appears often. They avoid athletes, unlike many of their
                    contemporaries. Athena, patroness of heroes, appears on eight vases by the
                    Syleus Painter, most often in company, as here, but sometimes alone. For her
                    dotted aegis with "running dog" border, compare the painter's namepiece, the
                    stamnos <rs type="vase">Copenhagen 3293</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 251, no. 36</bibl>), but especially the pelike <rs
                        type="vase">Louvre G 233</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 251, on. 26</bibl>) where one little snake coils up
                    from her right arm and several rear out behind her left side. For the lion on
                    the shield compare that on the shield of the W√ºrzburg Athena (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 249, no. 7</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Beazley connected the subject of this picture with that of a later
                    vase, a volute krater in Ferrara (<bibl>ARV2, 612,
                        no. 1</bibl>), showing heroes offering twigs to Athena, a purification
                    according to some, a supplication according to others. Of course, whichever is
                    accepted, the object of the rite need not be the same in both pictures.
                    Nevertheless Erika Simon's interpretation of the later scene as concerning the
                    story of the Seven who fought against Thebes (<bibl
                        >AJA 67 [1963] 54ff.</bibl>) is attractive, and allows the conjecture that
                    we have here Adrastos, King of Argos, come to Athens to plead for help against
                    the Theban Kreon who had refused burial for those heroes who died fighting
                    against him. With Adrastos then might be Polyneikes (on whose behalf the battle
                    was fought) with the Theban Lion on his shield, and possibly Tydeus of Kalydon.
                    Both were sons-in-law to Adrastos and were killed in the war (for dead heroes as

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 34.3 cm; h. from base
                    to fillet (at juncture of neck and body) 24.2 cm; h. from fillet to mouth 10.2
                    cm; h. of figures 10.8 cm; d. at rim 15.1 cm; w. at top of neck 10.2 cm; w. at
                    mouth 10.2 cm; w. at base of neck 9.1 cm; w. at base 9.5 cm; w. at shoulder 20.9
                    cm. The shape is of the Nolan type, with high neck, broad shoulders, and pointed
                    base. The two loop handles connecting the sides of the neck with the shoulders
                    have triple vertical ridges. The vase has an echinus mouth and torus foot with a
                    reserved band at the bottom. Broken around the middle and mended. Small areas
                    restored in central area of Side A: hand and cup of youth; drapery and left hand
                    of woman. Minor chips on rim and base. The fabric is an orange-red clay. A
                    shiny, black glaze, unevenly applied, covers the exterior body of the vase,
                    except for palmettes beneath the handles and the figure scenes on both sides,
                    beneath which runs a reserved band of decoration consisting of an alternating
                    lotus and palmette pattern. <hi rend="ital">Black relief lines:

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> An ornamental band of
                    an alternating lotus and palmette pattern, enclosed within a single line at the
                    top and double lines at the bottom, encircles the body of the vase and serves as
                    ground line for the figure scenes. One large inverted palmette projects from the
                    base of each handle. On Side A a woman and a young warrior are pouring a
                    libation. The woman, facing left, holds an oinochoe in her right hand, a fold of
                    her garment in her left. She is clad in a long himation, decorated with an
                    x-design over the bosom, worn over a loose-sleeved Ionic chiton. Her long hair
                    is fastened behind by a tasselled ribbon in a snood, which hangs from the back
                    of her tiara. Her feet are bare and on each forearm she wears a snake bracelet.
                    Facing her, a young warrior holds a spear in his left hand. With his right hand
                    he extends a broad phiale towards her (The stem which makes the vessel look like
                    a kylix is an erroneous modern restoration.). He is dressed in a short chiton
                    with a chlamys falling from his shoulders. He is barefoot, and his short hair is
                    bound by a fillet. Side B depicts an aged man, standing facing left, leaning his
                    right hand on a knotted staff. He wears only the himation and a wreath of leaves
                    on his head. His hair is close-cropped; he has a full, spade-like beard, and is
                    barefoot.</p>
                <p>The attribution to the Berlin Painter was made by Nicholls. The
                    Berlin Painter excels in the simplicity of composition and in the innovative
                    placement of one or two figures unrestricted by any or very little ornamental
                    border; often referred to as a "spotlight technique." The figures are elegant
                    and majestic in their slender proportions. His use of relief line is sparing but
                    fine and his delicate drawing of the anatomy and facial features is
                    characteristic. Musculature is painstakingly detailed in dilute glaze. His
                    painting of drapery is characterized by long, flowing lines denoting supple
                    creases and folds. In the features of the young man and woman there is a subtle
                    blend of innovation and tradition, of late archaic and early classical elements,
                    reminiscent, in sculpture, of the Athena from the west pediment of the Temple of
                    Aphaia at Aegina and the Kritios Boy, ca. 480 B.C.</p>
                <p>A scene on a kalpis by the Berlin Painter in the Kunsthistorisches
                    Museum (<rs type="vase">Vienna 3739</rs>; <bibl
                       >CVA, Austria 3, Vienna 3, pl. 140, nos. 1-3</bibl>) of
                    Artemis pouring a libation for Apollo is very similar to that on the Kelsey
                    amphora. Apollo holds out a phiale, as did originally the youth on the Kelsey
                    vase. Like the woman on the Kelsey amphora, the goddess, with her hair tied back
                    in a net, wears a long chiton and himation and pulls her dress to the side with
                    her left hand, a gesture which recalls that of marble korai of the archaic
                    period.</p>
                <p>The scene is most likely a sacrifice before a young warrior's
                    departure for, or upon his return from, battle. There is a hoplite shield
                    propped up behind him, incised, but never painted. The military subject of the
                    scene reflects Athenian political events at the end of the first quarter of the
                    fifth century B.C., after the Persians had been defeated in Greece. The wreath
                    on the head of the old man suggests a festival of victory or thanksgiving,
                    perhaps for the young warrior's safe return.</p>
                <p>The Nolan shape is most favored by the Berlin Painter in his late
                    period (475-465 B.C., according to Cardon, <hi rend="ital"
                    >infra,</hi> p. 175). Two Nolans from the late period, one in Carlsruhe (<rs
                        type="vase">Karlsruhe B 95</rs>, <bibl
                       >CVA, Germany 7, Carlsruhe 1, pl. 15, nos. 1,3</bibl>) and the
                    other in Manchester (<rs type="vase">Manchester, University Museum,
                        111.1.40</rs>), are similar to the Kelsey example in their decoration with
                    two-figure scenes on the obverse and an ornamental band that extends completely
                    around the body. In the late period there is also a decline in the Berlin
                    Painter's style which becomes less inventive and inferior in execution. This is
                    evident on the Kelsey amphora in several details. There are signs of haste and
                    inconsistency in the painting of the palmettes beneath the handles, in the
                    lotus-palmette floral band, in the awkward shoulder of the youth, in the few
                    drops of black paint on the woman's cheek, in the careless application of the
                    black glaze to the body of the pot, and in the reduction to a formula of certain
                    facial features as well as the figural compositions. These features place the
                    vase within the late period of the Berlin Painter's oeuvre, that is, probably
                    early in the late period, ca. 475 B.C. For the Berlin Painter, see <bibl

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 21.5 cm; d. 17.0 cm.
                    Reconstructed from sherds; small chip on rim repaired in antiquity. Slight
                    mottling of ground on left side. Upper panel border alternating palmettes and
                    lotus flowers; lower border meander broken by squares with crosses; side border
                    narrow reserved lines. Volute with spreading tendrils on top of handle, band of
                    tongues beneath; volute at base of handle. Incised line at junction of foot and
                    body and near lower edge of foot. Interior lines in slight relief. The one-piece
                    oinochoe has a markedly bulging body, a short neck flaring to the rim, and a low
                    echinus foot; the top of the ridged handle is flush with the mouth. This shape
                    is often called a <hi rend="ital">chous</hi> to differentiate it
                    from the shouldered oinochoe; it is a common red-figure form from the late sixth
                    through the fifth century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Two figures walk toward
                    the right, a bearded man playing a double flute (<hi rend="ital"
                        >aulos</hi>) and a youth holding a drinking cup and a gnarled stick. The
                    slender bodies have a light, elastic quality, and a sense of easy walking
                    movement is suggested by the trailing foot on tiptoe. The aulist is in pure
                    profile, but the youth turns back to face him, his upper body in three-quarter
                    view. Both wear only a chlamys, the folds shown in straight, almost parallel
                    lines and the edges in a sharp zigzag. On the youth's chest the sternum is
                    marked by a double line, an unusual feature, and the line of his left pectoral
                    muscle swings into the upper arm. His torso has other anatomical details in very
                    faint lines; the <hi rend="ital">linea alba,</hi> interrupted by
                    two diamond shapes, and the <hi rend="ital">serratus magnus,</hi>
                    in a series of curves resembling stitching. Other anatomical details are few:
                    genitals with the pubic hair in the form of a cross, angled lines at the knees,
                    and cursory marks for the ankle bones. Both men have short hair edged with a
                    series of dots, and parted to show the small C-shaped ears; the aulist's wavy
                    beard and a suggestion of sideburns on the youth seem to be dry-brushed. While
                    the aulist's eye is drawn frontally, that of the youth is in profile.</p>
                <p>The walking figures form an open composition: the youth's turned head
                    and the extended <hi rend="ital">aulos</hi> serve to connect the
                    figures. The bodies are well-spaced, and the general verticality of the
                    composition is varied by the extended arms of the aulist and the diagonal line
                    of the youth's stick. While the first impression of the well-knit and graceful
                    figures is very pleasing, closer inspection shows that the work is inept in
                    several ways. The lines are frequently faltering and even broken, the hands are
                    awkward, and the lower legs and feet are badly contoured.</p>
                <p>Identification of the subject is not easy. Wine-drinking and music
                    are a normal part of the <hi rend="ital">komos</hi> or revel scenes
                    frequently depicted on red-figure vases. The theme may be derived ultimately
                    from the Dionysiac revels of satyrs and maenads, but probably most are merely
                    human activities ‚Äî part of the trend toward scenes of daily life and away
                    from the mythological emphasis of the black-figure style. Certainly the subject
                    is appropriate for wine cups and pitchers. However, the <hi rend="ital"
                       >komos</hi> scenes almost always show much more exuberant
                    figures than this rather sedate pair. In view of the disparity in age, the vase
                    might allude to the homosexual fondness of mature Greek men for young boys, yet
                    the scene scarcely looks like a seduction. Connection with the <hi rend="ital"
                       >komos</hi> seems more likely, the quietness perhaps a
                    reflection of the Berlin Painter's disinclination to portray highly dynamic
                    scenes.</p>
                <p>Certainly the artist of the Krannert oinochoe was strongly influenced
                    by the Berlin Painter (see <rs type="vase">Ann Arbor 77.7.1</rs>).
                    The slender, springy figures are one of his most prominent characteristics,
                    unmatched by any other Greek painter, and numerous details such as the torso
                    muscles of the youth, the unedged lips, the arc of the nostril, the forms of
                    eyes, ears, and genitals can also be paralleled in the work of the master.
                    However, the mediocre quality of the draftsmanship and the lack of such
                    characteristic features as hooked clavicles, the marking of the great trochanter
                    muscle on the buttocks, and the double curve of the ankle bone, make it clear
                    that the vase cannot be attributed to the Berlin Painter himself. His two chief
                    followers were Hermonax and the Providence Painter, but the Krannert oinochoe
                    does not fit well in the oeuvre of either man. Hermonax prefers fully-draped
                    figures in which the folds are drawn in curving lines, and his figures never
                    have the elastic quality seen here. The Providence Painter uses much heavier
                    bodies, which tend to be either completely static or to have very mannered
                    poses. One must assume this to be the work of an unknown follower of the Berlin
                    Painter.</p>
                <p>The dating is also difficult. The Berlin Painter's career is thought
                    to have lasted from the late sixth century into the seventies of the fifth
                    century, and his followers continue still later. Some elements of the Krannert
                    oinochoe, such as the profile eye of the youth, the double line of the sternum,
                    and the upper border design with the strongly curved leaves framing the
                    palmettes, suggest the Early Classical phase of Attic red-figure, generally
                    considered to begin c. 480 B.C., so a date around the end of the Berlin
                    Painter's career is plausible. For the Berlin Painter see Beazley, <bibl

                <p>Lent by the Washington University Gallery of Art; donated by Messrs.
                    Robert Brookings and Charles Parsons, 1904 (WU 3271). From Capua. Exhibited:
                    World's Fair, St. Louis, 1904; Archaeological Institute of America Convention,
                    St. Louis Art Museum, 1973.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 30.1 cm; d. of mouth
                    12.2 cm; d. of rim 14.4 cm; d. of foot 8.5 cm. Inside the pot are bits of
                    charred bone. It is in very good condition, with a good black glaze; there are
                    some chips on lip and flaking around lower body. A small rectangular hole on the
                    observe between the figures shows the wall of the vase to be quite thin. There
                    is a dent running around the neck just above its join with the body,
                    particularly visible on the reverse. The vase is a so-called "Nolan" amphora, a
                    small neck-amphora with inset echinus rim, neck set off from body, triple
                    handles, disk foot, and sparse decoration. A tooled ridge articulates the join
                    of rim and neck, a narrow molding that of neck and body, a wide band that of
                    body and foot. The upper handle-roots meet the neck at its join with the rim.
                    Apart from the three figures and their decorative base-line, all is black down
                    to the reserved lower edge of the foot. The foot underneath is reserved. The
                    mouth and neck inside are black. Reserved areas are covered with a red wash. The
                    black background above the meander border was filled in very unevenly,
                    free-hand, but below the meander the background was filled in as the vase was
                    turned on the wheel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The figures, two on the
                    obverse, one on the reverse, race around the upper body of the vase. Below them,
                    a band of stopped meander interrupted at two-pattern intervals by filled
                    cross-squares, runs around the vase. It is miscalculated, for on the obverse,
                    under the boy's left foot, is an extra cross-square which could have gone under
                    the handle B/A where there was room only for the start of one. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side A:</hi> A wreathed, bearded man pursues a boy to right.
                    Both are naked but for shawls draped over their arms, the man's narrow, the
                    boy's voluminous. The man carries his staff horizontally, emphasizing the
                    forward rush of the movement. The boy looks back at him, lifting his cloak in a
                    travesty of the bridal gesture. His long hair flows out ‚Äî in the wrong
                    direction. Around his head is a red-painted band. Red is used also for the man's
                    wreath; his hair is short. <hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> A boy flees
                    to left, only the drapery around his back and over his arms keeping his outflung
                    limbs together. The lyre in his right hand appears to be pulling him forward.
                    His short hair is bound by a red-painted wreath. Red paint is also used for the
                    plectrum and the string attaching it to the lyre.</p>
                <p>Thin glaze was used on all figures for inner markings showing
                    musculature of neck, chest, stomach, arms and legs, for navel-pubes line, for
                    pubic hair, for ribs and knees; on the obverse it is used for the man's
                    moustache and, on the boy, for hair about the face and for long wavy strands in
                    back; on the reverse for sideburns and wrist-line; for lines bordering the
                    meander band. Sketch marks are visible everywhere, for heads, bodies, drapery,
                    pleats. Marks show that the chin of the reverse figure was meant to be shorter
                    and less heavy. Relief outline is used for faces, and much elsewhere but
                    erratically.</p>

                <p>The neck-amphora called "Nolan" is named for a site in South Italy
                    where many vases of the shape were found. A great number of those whose
                    provenances are known do come from Nola, and nearby Capua, while a majority of
                    the rest come from other sites in South Italy, Sicily, and northern Italy.
                    Although some were found elsewhere and the provenances of many are unknown, it
                    is hard to avoid the conclusion that there was a particular market in the west
                    for this shape.</p>
                <p>It is thought that Hermonax' teacher, the Berlin Painter, popularized
                    the shape. Certainly he was a leader in the use of the single figure or
                    figure-grouping against a very black background, which signals a major change
                    from the preceding styles and which characterizes the decoration of Nolan
                    amphorae. His students and most painters associated with him decorated Nolans,
                    among them the Providence Painter, to whom this vase was first attributed (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1918</bibl>) It is noteworthy that most
                    painters of Nolan amphorae also decorated lekythoi (cf. <rs type="vase"
                       >Cleveland 28.660</rs>). Hermonax was a painter of larger pots,
                    but, unusually, he did cups also; indeed, of any one shape, the extant number of
                    his cups is the greatest. He signed his name on ten vases known to us, all
                    stamnoi and pelikai. There is evidence that at one time he may have worked in
                    the same shop or for the same potter as the Methyse Painter, whose work is shown
                    here, (<rs type="vase">Cincinnati 1962.386-388</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 485, no. 23 and 633, no. 1</bibl>). Not
                    all Nolans had the decoration high on the body with the decorative base-line
                    running around the vase, but many painters liked it and many of the Nolans
                    decorated in this way have two figures on one side, one on the other, as does
                    this one and <rs type="vase">Ann Arbor 77.7.1</rs>, by the Berlin
                    Painter himself. Both of these have triple handles; ridged handles on Nolan
                    amphorae appear later (<bibl>Caskey &amp;
                        Beazley, ii 39</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The subject may be Zeus pursuing Ganymede, but need not be, for the
                    figures carry no identifying attributes, such as Zeus' scepter or Ganymede's
                    playthings (hoop or cock). The boy on the reverse carries a lyre (more often
                    associated with Tithonos in his flight from Eos). Zeus is said to have carried
                    off Ganymede, prince of Troy, to be his cup-bearer, later his bedfellow
                    ("catamite" derives from "Ganymede" through the Latin). It is also said that
                    Ganymede was first abducted by Eos, the Dawn, who was in the habit of such
                    carryings-on ‚Äî and off. Pursuit scenes, Zeus after Ganymede, Eos after
                    Tithonos or Kephalos, Boreas after Oreithyia (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Chicago 1889.22</rs>), satyr after maenad (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Chicago 1905.345</rs>), man after woman, were popular at the time and often
                    included companions of the pursued fleeing in confusion. Symeonoglou makes the
                    attractive suggestion that the boy on the reverse is the same as the one on the
                    obverse; we see the scene on film, as it were, projected on the vase. This is
                    possible, but it is more probable that, if the sides are related (and on most of
                    the painter's Nolans they are), the boy on the reverse is a companion of the one
                    on the obverse; if they are one and the same, he has managed to pick up a lyre
                    in flight. Martin Robertson, in discussing the running or striding figures of
                    the Berlin Painter, in which those of Hermonax were conceived, refers to the
                    figure of an Apollo as being "a reefed ship" in contrast to that of a maenad
                    "under full sail" (<bibl><title
                        >AJA</title> 62 [1958] 61</bibl>). The same might well be said of the St.
                    Louis runners.</p>
                <p>There are a good number of vases in the midwest by the Berlin
                    Painter's pupils, or in his manner, or by the painter himself (see <rs
                        type="vase">Ann Arbor 77.7.1</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >Champaign 70.8.6</rs>). Among these is a lekythos (<rs
                        type="vase">Indianapolis 47.35</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 1003, no. 21</bibl>) with Zeus pursuing Ganymede, done
                    in the manner of the Achilles Painter (who, like Hermonax, was a student of the
                    Berlin Painter) and there is a pelike in The University of Chicago painted by
                    Hermonax (<bibl>ARV2, 485, no. 29</bibl>).</p>
                <p>In a letter to a dear friend, over sixty-five years ago, Beazley said
                    "The fortieth child was born to Hermonax yesterday" (<bibl
                       >M. Robertson. "A Tribute to Sir John Beazley," <title
                           >Lincoln College Record 1971-1972</title> [Oxford]
                    19</bibl>). Today there are over 160 vases attributed to him.</p>

                    cm; d. of body 14.4 cm; d. of foot 9.5 cm. Broken and repaired. The lekythos has
                    no false interior. It is of standard shape, type 2, with the neck set off from
                    mouth and shoulder by flange and fillet, and a band, tooled above and below,
                    joining body and foot. The side of the disk foot is reserved, and grooved around
                    the upper edge. Inside, the mouth is black. The top of the lip is reserved, the
                    mouth, neck, handle and upper surface of the foot are black.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Egg and dot pattern
                    ring the neck. The shoulder floral is reserved: a central pendent palmette, the
                    tendrils bounding it each ending in a single spiral and giving off a lotusbud;
                    tendrils on each side originating near the heart of the central palmette
                    encircle the palmettes in which they terminate. Bands of meander and
                    cross-square bound the picture above and below, each consisting of three stopped
                    meanders to right, interrupted above by two black-filled cross-squares (an extra
                    meander at the right was mostly covered by the black background), below by a
                    dotted saltire-square and a cross-square.</p>
                <p>A bearded warrior, his hair braided in back, prepares to cut off a
                    forelock with his sword. In front of him his equipage is piled on and against a
                    folding stool: a shield, seen in three-quarter view so that the inside webbing
                    and tassels show, a spear, leaning in counterpoint to the angle at which the
                    warrior stands, its point cut off by the border, a Thracian helmet set on top of
                    a folded cloak, both laid on top of a cushion covering the seat of the stool.
                    The warrior wears a cuirass with leather flaps over a short, finely pleated
                    chiton, and greaves; his scabbard is slung at his left side from a strap across
                    his body. There is a fillet around his hair, and tassels hanging from the
                    scabbard and lower back edges of his greaves, all done in red paint. Anatomical
                    details are worked on the greaves and on the cuirass, the leather flaps of which
                    are covered with scales. The helmet is decorated with a palmette in front, a
                    lion in black on the cheek-flap and a cross in the neck-piece; the crest is
                    attached to the helmet by a checkered ridge. The cushion on the stool is woven
                    or embroidered with rows of zigzags, the stool itself has animal legs attached
                    to the seat by large bosses decorated with crosses. There is much play of dark
                    and light in the composition. There is relief contour almost everywhere. For a
                    full description, see C. G. Boulter in <bibl
                    >CVA</bibl>, from which much of the above is taken.</p>
                <p>Identical and meaningless inscriptions are painted in red on each
                    side of the warrior, reading vertically (see <bibl
                        >CVA</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Oionokles Painter is called after a kalos name (once read
                    Dionokles) which has so far appeared only on vases by him. He was a follower of
                    the Providence Painter and his extant produce, like that of the Providence
                    Painter and other students and followers of the Berlin Painter, comprises mostly
                    Nolan amphorae and lekythoi (compare <rs type="vase">St. Louis WU
                        3271</rs>). But there is evidence, in a series of small neck-amphorae, and
                    through the text and handwriting of certain inscriptions, that the Oinokles
                    Painter worked at one time for the same potter as a cup painter who belonged to
                    the circle of the Brygos Painter, the Briseis Painter (<bibl
                       >Caskey &amp; Beazley, ii, 3 f</bibl>). Meaningless
                    inscriptions like the ones on the Cleveland lekythos occur on vases by both
                    painters (<hi rend="ital">ibid</hi>).</p>
                <p>Like the Providence Painter and his fellows, the Oionokles Painter
                    did numerous pursuit scenes, but this quiet scene is his most well-known. It is
                    cited often for the subject matter, which has long been related to fuller
                    pictures showing an episode in the story of the Seven Against Thebes (see also
                        <rs type="vase">Chicago 1922.2197</rs>). The Seven who fought
                    against Thebes are said to have fastened locks of their hair to the chariot of
                    the Argive leader Adrastos before the battle as mementos to be taken back should
                    they perish. Among the vases showing the subject, an inscription on one gives
                    the name of the hair-cutter as Parthenopaios, one of the Seven (son of Atlanta,
                    for whom see <rs type="vase">Cleveland 66.114</rs>). There is only
                    one other painting, like this, with the single figure of a hair-cutter, a white
                    ground lekythos in New York by the Painter of the Yale Lekythos <bibl
                       >ARV2, 660, no. 71</bibl>). The New York warrior,
                    like the Cleveland one, has a Thracian helmet. Both have been identified with,
                    at least shown to have been inspired by, representations of Parthenopaios.</p>
                <p>C. G. Boulter (<bibl>CVA</bibl>) has
                    given a number of interesting parallels for representations of folded cloaks
                    like the one here, and has noted the elaborate webbing inside the shield, and
                    the triangle of St. Andrews crosses made by the fastenings of the stool together
                    with the one on the neck-guard of the helmet (an echo of which may perhaps be
                    seen in the crossed fastenings of the scabbard). The warrior's braided hair was
                    fashionable in the art of the time. It is shown often in vase-paintings, for
                    example on the name-piece of the Achilles Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 987, no. 1</bibl>), and on sculpture of the period,
                    such as the so-called Blond Boy, of which type there is a marble head in The
                    Cleveland Museum of Art (<bibl>Ridgway 1970,
                    59</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Compare this lekythos and the red-figure one by Douris, <rs
                        type="vase">Cleveland 78.59</rs>, also from Cleveland. They are
                    nearly contemporary, and of the same shape type, though there are differences in
                    proportion and subsidiary decoration. Both show a similar interest in details of
                    armor, in perspective, and in the contrast of light and dark areas. The
                    Oionokles Painter has employed the same sort of detailing on clothing and armor
                    in his rendering of a Persian warrior on a Nolan amphora (<rs type="vase"
                       >Berlin F 2331</rs>, <bibl>ARV2,
                        646, no. 7</bibl>).</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 35.5 cm; d. of mouth
                    10.6 cm; d. of rim 14.7 cm; max. d. of body 30.0 cm at 20.0 cm from base; d. of
                    foot 13.2 cm. Broken and repaired, with some patching on the neck about the
                    vertical handle. Restored: a large section below figures to left of center; feet
                    of figures 2 and 3 from left; lower parts of garments, and feet of figures 4, 5
                    and 6 from left; lower right part of fountain platform; part of lotus pattern at
                    left. There are spots of retouching on all figures. The wash covering the
                    reserved areas has fired a sort of greenish-orange. Horizontal brush strokes are
                    visible on the lower part of the body, vertical ones near the picture. The
                    hydria is of kalpis shape, with a smooth curve running from neck to foot. The
                    picture is set on the shoulder between the body-handles and just above them,
                    extending a little beyond the near root on each side. The black of the vase
                    outside the picture zone is emphasized by narrow areas left reserved: the
                    surface and underside of the rim, a strip around the bottom of the foot, the
                    inside of each horizontal handle, and a band on the vase between the roots of
                    each. The vertical handle is all black; the sides and upper edge of the rim are
                    black; mouth and neck are black inside to a depth of 3.0 cm; the body is
                    reserved inside. A narrow band bordered by tooled grooves joins body to
                    torus-shaped foot; the underside of the foot is reserved. Red painted lines
                    encircle the upper edge of the rim inside, the neck, the outside edge of the
                    foot. Below the picture a band of linked lotusbuds binds handle to handle, as
                    the reserved areas of the handle-zones bind handle to vase and root to root. The
                    picture is framed by a band of lotusbuds above, at the sides a double row of
                    netted dots (pomegranates in origin), and a reserved line below which serves as
                    a ground line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The scene shows the
                    vase itself, a water jar, in use: men and women at a fountain. Are the men here
                    bartering for women or water? At the right a woman stands before a fierce
                    lion-head spout, holding a round object, perhaps a sponge, in her hand. A stream
                    of water, done in red paint, issues from the lion's mouth. Below the spout a
                    hydria-kalpis sits on a stepped platform. Another woman walks carefully away
                    from the fountain, looking back at it and balancing a small pointed hydria on
                    her head. The little hydria cuts into the lotus-pattern above the picture, but
                    the painter had forgotten to stop for it when drawing the line bordering the
                    lotus below. In the center of the scene a bearded man, holding up a red painted
                    flower, leans on his walking stick and talks with a woman whose hydria, of
                    black-figure shape, stands on the ground between them; in her left hand is some
                    object rendered by a red-painted dot. At the right, a woman with an empty hydria
                    on her head walks toward the fountain while rejecting the advances of a bearded
                    man behind her. The men have short hair wreathed with leaves, which are neatly
                    painted in red. The central man's hair hangs in curly fringes over his neck. Two
                    of the women have their long hair bound up in a <hi rend="ital"
                        >krobylos,</hi> a sort of pony-tail, the bow tied under it. The woman with
                    the hydria on her head also wears a wreath done in red paint. One woman lets her
                    hair down her back but ties up the ends in a knot, one has hers covered with a
                    sakkos or headcloth. The bands and knots are all done in red paint. All the
                    women wear chitons with flowing sleeves, two have cloaks draped over their
                    shoulders; all wear drop earrings; all wear a single pendant or amulet on a
                    necklace. The men are swathed neck to foot in himatia.</p>
                <p>Thin glaze was used for fringes of hair, pleats of chiton sleeves and
                    fastenings, necklaces, dots decorating sakkos, neck-muscles of the man at
                    center, moustache of the man at left. It looks as though a very fine relief line
                    was used everywhere; in some places it appears to have modern reinforcements.
                    Extensive sketching is visible everywhere.</p>
                <p>Fountain scenes, so appropriate to the use of the vase, are more
                    common on the black-figure hydriai of a generation earlier. These black-figure
                    hydriai with the picture surfaces defined by an articulated shoulder and body
                    were well-suited to the vertical compositions of water-bearers and columns (cf.
                        <rs type="vase">Toledo 1961.23</rs>). There are some red-figure
                    hydriae of this shape and there are some black-figure hydriae of the kalpis
                    shape, like the Detroit one (cf. also <rs type="vase">Champaign
                        70.8.4</rs>), but the kalpis, its body formed by unbroken curves, is a
                    development of the red-figure period (It is a modern convention to confine the
                    term to this shape). The earliest have the picture on the shoulder. This scheme
                    remains popular, though later, as the hydria body grows taller and slimmer, the
                    picture moves back down the vase (cf. <rs type="vase">Chicago
                        1911.456</rs>). Hydriai of both shapes are shown in the vase-painting here.</p>
                <p>Only four other hydriai have been attributed to the Pig Painter and
                    at least three of these are late. The Detroit hydria was done relatively early
                    in the Pig Painter's career. The painter takes his name from the picture of a
                    swineherd on a pelike in Cambridge, England. Beazley first called him the
                    See-Saw Painter after a fragment in Boston (<bibl
                        >Beazley 1918, 118</bibl>), but later gave that piece instead to the
                    Leningrad Painter and changed the name. He was a student of Myson, and one of
                    the earliest members of the Mannerist workshop (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Detroit 24.120</rs> and <rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.16</rs>).
                    Beazley considered the possibility that the Pig Painter "might even be Myson in
                    his later years" (<bibl><title
                            >Museum Journal,</title> University of Pennsylvania 23
                    [1932-33]33</bibl>). But, though Myson taught the earlier Mannerists, his column
                    kraters are not shop-shape, there are no extant hydriai by him, and he painted
                    various shapes which were not taken up by his students. Also, there are
                    differences in personality between the painters, which argue for two
                    individuals. The Detroit hydria was painted when the artist was still working
                    "in the manner of Myson" (<bibl>ARV1</bibl> and
                        <bibl>ARV2, infra</bibl>) and before, but I
                    think not too long before, he was exposed to strong influence from the Pan
                    Painter, who was possibly Myson's student though not a member of the shop.
                    Compare with the figures on the Detroit vase those of the women on the obverse
                    of a column krater by Myson in K√ºsnacht (<bibl
                        >Para., 349, no. 29 bis</bibl>). Compare also the head of a man on a
                    fragment by the Pig Painter in Adria (<bibl>ARV2,
                        564, no. 25</bibl>). Two works which are very close to the one in Detroit
                    are by artists who worked in the manner of the Pig Painter: a pelike in
                    Adolphseck and a fragment in Naples (<bibl>ARV2,
                        566, nos. 6 and 9</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The band of lotusbuds is a normal part of the subsidiary decoration
                    for red-figure column kraters, and column kraters were the principal product of
                    the Mannerist shop, so it is not surprising to find lotus decorating other
                    shapes from that shop as well (cf. <rs type="vase">University of
                        Chicago 1967.115.68</rs>). The Pig Painter even used it on the necks of two
                    early amphorae (<bibl>ARV2, 565, nos. 38 and
                    39</bibl>) ‚Äî odd for red-figure neck-amphorae.</p>
                <p>There are two column kraters by the Pig Painter, <rs type="vase"
                       >Cleveland 24.197</rs>, somewhat later than the Detroit hydria,
                    and <rs type="vase">Cleveland 26.549</rs>, later still, showing the
                    influence of the Pan Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 564, nos.
                        18 and 563, no. 9</bibl>). There is a hydria from the Mannerist shop, by the
                    Agrigento Painter, <rs type="vase">Minneapolis 47.34</rs>, a
                    fragment of one by the same painter at The University of Chicago (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 579, nos. 83 and 86</bibl>), and a

                    26.0 cm; d. of rim 33.2 cm; w. handle to handle 39.3 cm; max. d. of body 31.5 cm
                    at 23.5 cm from base; d. of foot 16.5 cm. Broken and repaired. Numerous large
                    cracks running over entire surface repaired, restored, and repainted.
                    Restorations: much of rim, area at base of handles, most of lower body
                    immediately above foot; on the obverse, face and diagonal section of Helios from
                    shoulder to waist and through buttock, crack across muzzles of horses; on the
                    reverse, most of face of figure at right, and small sections of the other
                    figures. The glaze is fired greenish in places and is very shiny. Inside, good
                    glaze on the neck, matt black on the body. The reserved areas outside are
                    covered with a red wash. The lip, with handle-plates, is relatively flat, the
                    foot is of two degrees, the upper of angular profile, the lower torus-shape. The
                    outside of the foot is black except for a reserved strip around the base; it is
                    reserved underneath. The underside of rim and handle-plates is reserved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> All the subsidiary
                    decoration is black on a reserved background: linked lotusbuds on top of the
                    lip, with palmettes bounded by lyre-shaped tendrils on the handle-plates; ivy
                    around the outside of the rim; on the neck a band of linked lotusbuds obverse,
                    reverse undecorated; pictures on obverse and reverse are framed by tongues
                    above, ivy at sides, reserved band below; there are rays above the foot. Red
                    lines are painted around the upper edges of rim and handle-plates, inside and
                    out, and all around the vase below the picture and above the rays, and around
                    the outside edge of the upper degree of the foot. There are indications that the
                    lotus on the lip was painted before the palmettes on the handle-plates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Helios, the sun, holding a
                    prod, passes over the sea in his chariot, pulled by two winged horses. Parts of
                    the reins are painted red. The sea is indicated by red-painted waves and a
                    dolphin plunging between the horses' legs. Of the horses we see one body, one
                    wing, two tails, eight legs, two heads; of the chariot, one wheel. Sloppy
                    drawing has left unclear the demarcation between leg and chariot. A rayed disk
                    on his head identifies the charioteer, who is otherwise quite human, and of the
                    second quarter of the fifth century B.C.: short hair wreathed, short beard,
                    short chiton, shawl about shoulder. The wreath is painted in red. <hi
                        rend="ital">Side B:</hi> A komos, in the center a draped young
                    man, on each side of him a naked young man dancing; or perhaps it is a scene
                    from the exercise ground (palaestra) since often the same set of characters
                    portray a draped trainer and two naked athletes. All have red painted bands
                    about their heads, fastened in front.</p>
                <p>Thin glaze was used for pupils of eyes, human, horse, and dolphin,
                    fringes of hair about faces, sideburns, neck muscles, inner body markings,
                    details on horses' wings, border of himation on the central figure of reverse.
                    On the obverse, there is relief outline, quite delicate, everywhere, even for
                    sun's rays; on the reverse only on the central figure for a bit of right hand,
                    hem at lower right, top and heel of left foot, length of nose and the line of
                    chin-neck-shoulder, and on the figure at right the line of chin-neck-shoulder,
                    and a bit of the left leg. Broad preliminary contour lines are quite distinct
                    from the background which had fired greenish. On the obverse, sketch lines show
                    the top of the very flat head through the sun disk. A line across Helios' back
                    and lower arms indicates that a higher position was perhaps initially intended
                    for the prod. Some indecision over placement of the horse's rump is apparent in
                    the sketch. Sketches show the tail of far horse through the chariot and Helios'
                    left leg behind the wheel. On the reverse the drapery below the knee of the
                    central figure was narrower in the sketch and there are many sketch lines for
                    the body of the figure at left.</p>
                <p>The ancient Greeks added water to their wine, mixing it in large open
                    containers which we call kraters (from the Greek <hi rend="ital"
                        >kerannymi,</hi> to mix). The bell, calyx, volute, and column krater are all
                    named for their shape. There is good evidence that the column krater, named for
                    the form of its handles, originated in Corinth, and that in antiquity it was
                    called "korinthos" (<bibl>Beazley in <title
                           >AJA</title> 31 [1927] 351</bibl>; see <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 16</bibl>). The shape was not taken up
                    immediately by red-figure painters. There is an early bilingual column krater
                    with red-figure on one side, black-figure on the other, and red-figure fragments
                    of another (<bibl>ARV2, 11, nos. 5 and 6</bibl>). At
                    the turn of the century and in the decade after, a number of painters turned out
                    some red-figure column kraters, several of which have links with column kraters
                    of the black-figure Leagros Group (<bibl>ARV2, 235,
                        below</bibl>). There are connections between these and the work of the first
                    major painter of red-figure column kraters, Myson. Myson's students and their
                    followers, who comprise the so-called Mannerist workshop, produced column
                    kraters, pelikai and hydriai for over three-quarters of a century. There were
                    other painters whose style was mannered, but in the context of fifth century
                    Attic vase-painting, the term Mannerist is used to refer to members of that shop
                    and to the Pan Painter, who early exercised a great influence over them, without
                    joining their union.</p>
                <p>The Leningrad Painter was an early and prolific member of the
                    Mannerist workshop. Named for an amphora in the Hermitage, he first appears as
                    the Petrograd Painter (<bibl>Beazley 1925,
                    245</bibl>), but changes with the times (<bibl>ARV1,
                        373</bibl>). He worked together at the beginning with the Pig Painter, to
                    whom, indeed, Beazley first gave one of his earliest pieces, fragments of a
                    column krater with girls on a seesaw (<rs type="vase">Boston
                    10.191</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 569, no. 49</bibl>). The
                    Detroit column krater was done when their association was still close and the
                    influence of their mentor, Myson, was still apparent (it is a little later than
                    the Detroit hydria by the Pig Painter, <rs type="vase">Detroit
                        63.13</rs>). The face and drapery of Helios are not far from those of the
                    girl at left on one of the Boston fragments (<hi rend="ital"
                    >supra</hi>), and the same details are comparable in the Theseus on an earlyish
                    column krater by the Pig Painter in Ferrara (<bibl
                        >ARV2, 563, no. 6</bibl>). The figures on the reverse side of the Detroit
                    krater demonstrate the relationship particularly well in their stances,
                    gestures, proportions, and in the drapery. Compare the figures of a trainer and
                    athlete on a column krater by Myson in Naples (<bibl
                        >ARV2, 241, no. 55bis</bibl>) and those of the athletes and trainer on the
                    reverse of a krater in Brussels by the Pig Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 563, no. 5</bibl>). Contrast the figures on the
                    Leningrad Painter's Chicago hydria, <rs type="vase">Chicago
                        1911.456</rs>, done probably some fifteen years later.</p>
                <p>The pot has the normal lip, handles, foot, and subsidiary decoration
                    for a column krater, but the forms of the rim and foot, and the rendering of the
                    lotus decoration are trademarks of the Mannerist workshop (see <rs type="vase"
                       >Chicago 1889.16</rs>, a somewhat later krater by a painter of
                    the same shop). These features are so consistent that it is probable that one
                    potter or set of potters was producing vases which various painters then
                    decorated. It is also possible that one painter might have been doing the
                    subsidiary decoration for others or for himself and others. Similarly, in a
                    workshop like this, it is possible that one painter might have drawn broad
                    contour lines for the figured decoration while another filled in the detail.
                    Although a great many mediocre vases came out of that shop, the Mannerists can
                    often be depended on for interesting subject matter, such as this (cf. also <rs

                <p>Helios, the Sun, was said to drive his chariot across the sky every
                    day and sail home on the ocean at night in a golden bowl. Euripides, in
                    describing the shield of Achilles, refers to "the blazing disk and winged mares"
                    of the Sun (<bibl n="Eur. El. 464">Eur. El.
                        464-466</bibl>, as quoted by <bibl>M. J. Milne
                        in <title>AJA</title> 61[1957] 314</bibl>). Helios is always
                    shown in his chariot in the vase-painting, but it is not a common subject in
                    red-figure. The Sun rising, the chariot in frontal view, was however a favorite
                    for painters of black-figure lekythoi at the end of the sixth century and
                    beginning of the fifth (<bibl>Haspels 1936</bibl>).
                    The waves and dolphins here can mean simply his passage over the seas, or imply
                    his passage back at night on the ocean. They also recall his peculiar possession
                    of the sea-bound island of Rhodes-the third century Colossus of Rhodes, made to
                    represent Helios, was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Helios is
                    said to have kept herds of cattle, and Homer tells of how Odysseus' men
                    sacrificed the cattle of the Sun, and met unhappy fates. Apollo, who also kept
                    herds and had trouble with cattle-thieving, was already being identified with
                    the Sun in the fifth century, but Helios was a child of the Titans, not an
                    Olympian god, and there is no confusion between the two in representation on
                    vases.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 42.4 cm; d. of mouth
                    10.3 cm; d. of rim 15.6 cm; d. of foot 16.3 cm; w. handle to handle 37.6 cm;
                    max. d. of body 31.8 cm at 24.5 cm from base. Intact; there is a spall under the
                    rim at right of the figured scene. The inside of the mouth is painted black to a
                    depth of about 3 cm; below this the neck is reserved but covered with an orange
                    wash; the body inside is reserved. The glaze is unevenly laid on and unevenly
                    fired, with patches of red and green on the shoulder where brush strokes are
                    visible, and large areas of mottled greenish-grey on the back of the vase. All
                    the reserved areas of the vase except the inside of body and the undersides of
                    lip and foot are covered with an uneven wash; it is stronger on the figured
                    areas. The hydria is of kalpis shape (cf. entries 100 and 95), with overhanging
                    rim and a foot of two degrees, the lower a flat and narrow disk, the upper high
                    and angular. The upper surface of the lip and a narrow band at the bottom of the
                    foot are reserved. There is a tooled groove at the join of body and foot, and at
                    the juncture between the degrees of the foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The outside of the rim
                    has a band of egg decoration. Where the curve of the neck enters the curve of
                    the shoulder a short band of ivy and berry, bounded by reserved lines which are
                    outlined in relief, makes an upper border for the picture. The ivy is reserved:
                    it appears to have been painted over with purple; the main stalk and the
                    branches of ivy are painted over with white. The berries are raised dots of
                    clay, painted red over a white undercoat. The figures of the scene are close-set
                    and all is vertical, giving an impression of broad orange stripes. The figures
                    stand on a reserved band outlined in relief. Below this there is a wide band of
                    meander running to right, under the figured zone only.</p>
                <p>Young men and women. The scene takes place indoors: a lekythos and a
                    sakkos hanging on the wall put the central couple in inverted commas. The
                    figures at left and right focus their attention on this pair. Only their
                    interest takes the composition out of the vertical. In the center a young man,
                    himation draped about his waist, wreath of leaves about his short curly hair,
                    leans on a knotted stick, his left arm around the girl who stands before him,
                    his right hand cupped at her crotch. She has her arms about his neck, would
                    appear to be about to tweak his ear, their noses touch. Presumably they are
                    about to kiss, although nose-touching may be the ultimate object of the
                    exercise. She wears a chiton with loose overfold, and a necklace. At left a
                    young man and a woman look on. He is leaning on a knotted stick, completely
                    enveloped in his himation. A thick band, probably of wool, binds his curly hair
                    over a wreath. The woman wears chiton and himation, a sakkos with a pom-pom on
                    top covers her hair, a necklace with a single pendant lies on her chest, in her
                    right hand she holds an object of some kind. At right a woman stands frontal,
                    daintily holding up the skirt of her himation in her right hand, an embroidery
                    frame in her left. She wears a necklace with single pendant low on her chest; a
                    wide band binds up her hair. The curves in the pleats of her chiton show her
                    full breast. All the women wear disk earrings.</p>
                <p>Sketch marks are visible, giving detailed outlines of all five
                    figures, mostly well within the lines of the finished forms. Relief outline has
                    been used almost everywhere; it is lacking conspicuously only on the youth at
                    left along the line of his arm under the drapery, and on the woman next to him
                    along the line of drapery falling from the bundled gathers of material at her
                    left arm. Added color was used for the wreath at the front of the head of the
                    youth at left, red over white, I think. A line through the middle of his
                    head-band seems to be done in thin glaze, and thin glaze was used for the bands
                    tying the hair of the kissing girl. Thin glaze was also used for fringes of hair
                    on all figures, for the lines on the throat, the sideburns, the ribs of the
                    young man at center, for the necklaces of the women at right and center, for
                    details of cloth on the embroidery frame.</p>
                <p>Graffiti: Incised underneath the foot on opposite sides are two bent
                    bars, one consisting in part of a number of close-set parallel slashes; near
                    that one are three incised circles.</p>
                <p>The Leningrad Painter, like other earlier Mannerists, specialized in
                    column kraters, of which the one in Detroit by him, <rs type="vase"
                        >Detroit 24.120</rs>, is a typical example. His hydriai were mostly of the
                    normal workshop type (see <rs type="vase">Detroit 63.13</rs>). This
                    hydria, however, and one by him in the Vatican (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 572, no. 87</bibl>), together with several by other
                    painters of the same shop, in their particular decoration, are precursors of a
                    class of hydriai which Beazley recognized among works by the Nausicaa Painter
                    and other later Mannerists (<bibl>ARV2,
                    1121</bibl>). The class is distinguished by size, shape of lip and foot,
                    subsidiary decoration, and placement of the picture high on the body. In this,
                    our hydria and the ones like it differ only in size, in a less exaggerated foot,
                    and in that the picture covers more of the body of the vase (the hydria, <rs
                        type="vase">Champaign 70.8.4</rs>, attributed to the Syracuse
                    Painter, also has the picture high on the body, but contrast the band of
                    decoration above the picture, and the form of the foot). Otherwise, the ivy, the
                    meander, and the details of shape on the Chicago hydria are characteristic of
                    that class.</p>
                <p>The foot of this hydria is interesting in that it is cousin to the
                    column krater foot peculiar to the workshop (see <rs type="vase"
                        >Chicago 1889.16</rs>. The vase was done late in the painter's career when
                    the Oinanthe and the Nausicaa Painters were already working in the shop. The
                    rendering of ears, eyes, nose, pendulous lower lip, and drapery is
                    characteristic of the Leningrad Painter's later work: compare the figures on his
                    namepiece, a type B amphora (<rs type="vase">St. Petersburg B
                    2228</rs>, <bibl>ARV2, 570, no. 70</bibl>) and the
                    faces of figures on a hydria (<rs type="vase">London E 167</rs>,
                        <bibl>ARV2, 571, no. 77</bibl>) and contrast the
                    drawing on his earlier vase, <rs type="vase">Detroit 24.120</rs>.
                    The Leningrad Painter touches elbows with the "later Mannerists" again in a
                    neck-amphora with twisted handles, <rs type="vase">Munich 2323</rs>
                        (<bibl>ARV2, 571, no. 72</bibl>), which pairs
                    ones by the Nausicaa Painter in Munich and Berlin (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 1107, nos. 1 and 2</bibl>). The ivy on the Chicago
                    hydria and related ones reappears on these amphorae, wreathing the necks.</p>
                <p>Such intimate scenes as this between men and women are rare in the
                    Leningrad Painter's work and this in particular is unique. Representations of
                    men and women kissing are, in general, not common. For the action, compare
                    kissing scenes in the tondos of two cups by the aptly named Kiss Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 177, nos. 1 and 2</bibl>). Our young man's
                    gesture is not unusual: compare those of komasts on column kraters in Harvard
                    and Palermo by the Leningrad Painter's companion, the Pig Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 563, nos. 8 and 564, no. 20</bibl>). The
                    embroidery frame here gives a certain domestic touch, but it is balanced by the
                    walking sticks of the men, who have surely gathered with the local ladies of the
                    evening. All appear to be gazing benevolently at the initiation of a young
                    recruit, rather than at a tender meeting of the affianced ("ladies" were not
                    shown thus in the art of the fifth century, although it was apparently
                    acceptable to show gentlemen kissing young gentlemen). A cup by the Penthesilea
                    Painter (<rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.27</rs>) shows a similar but
                    more explicit scene: the embroidery frame is there but so is the money bag.</p>
                <p>The two representations of "embroidery frames" on vases at the Art
                    Institute count among a very small number of illustrations of the object
                    (compare, for example, one shown on a pyxis in the Louvre by the Painter of the
                    Louvre Centauromachy, <bibl>ARV2, 1094, no.
                    104</bibl>). Such frames might have been used for embroidery, but could also
                    have been used for wearing or braiding. I am indebted to Mrs. Louise Clark of
                    Madison, Wisconsin, for this information and for kindly making available to me
                    her notes and an article on the subject which she is preparing for

                    Naples, who is said to have bought it from the family of a general of the
                    Bourbon army.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 46.5 cm; d. of mouth
                    29.3 cm; d. of rim 38.0 cm; h. of rim 4.5 cm; w. handle to handle 45.6 cm; max.
                    d. of body 36.6 cm at 28.0 cm from base; d. of foot 19.0 cm. Broken and
                    repaired. Missing parts are filled with plaster, in particular: joins of handles
                    and body, parts of ray decoration; on obverse, part of drapery of the winged
                    woman, a section of Salmoneus' head above the forehead, much of his left hand,
                    part of right hand of the woman at right, and her eye; on reverse, back of head;
                    part of neck, parts of drapery of figure at left, lower back hairline and parts
                    of lower drapery of central figure, parts of right wing, and cracks along figure
                    at right. The glaze fired greenish in many places; horizontal brush strokes are
                    apparent on the reverse of neck, and vertical ones on the surfaces of the vase
                    below handlezones and between picture panels; there is much abrasion on the
                    reverse figures. The rays were painted sloppily with the vase upside down; it
                    can be seen that they were painted first and then black was put on in horizontal
                    brush strokes above them and around the band at join of foot and body‚Äîtoo
                    soon, for they are smeared in places. The upper surfaces of the rim and
                    handle-plates are relatively flat. The foot is of two degrees of about equal
                    height, the upper angular in profile, the lower wider and of torus shape.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The subsidiary
                    decoration is as that of the column krater, <rs type="vase">Detroit
                        24.120</rs>, with palmettes over the handle-plates, lotus bud wreath around
                    top of rim and on neck of obverse, ivy around outside of rim; there are tongues
                    above, ivy at sides, and a reserved line below to frame the pictures; rays
                    surround the base; there are red lines painted around the vase at rim, inside
                    and out, under the picture, over the rays, and around the upper degree of the
                    foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Salmoneus maddened.
                    Salmoneus is shown challenging the heavens, leaning strongly to his right, right
                    leg bent, left outstretched and taut. His head is thrown back, the wild eye
                    rendered by circle and dot pupil. A smudge of thin glaze over the inside corner
                    of Salmoneus' eye and a line below it appear to be intended for eyelashes and
                    cheek-line. His left arm is held straight out brandishing high a sword; the
                    empty scabbard, dotted along the rim, is slung at his left side from a dotted
                    strap across his chest. The sword intrudes into the tongue decoration above the
                    picture, the bounding lines of which were painted across the sword. Along with
                    the sword he holds a wreath and chains in his left hand. His right arm is
                    lowered and tensed, in the hand a thunderbolt ready to be thrown. On his right
                    leg is a greave, on his left arm another; from his left ankle dangles a fetter;
                    fillets, wreaths and chains are tied about his body, arms and thighs; other
                    chains fall around him. Around his flowing golden hair, rendered in thin glaze,
                    there is a fillet and the remains of a wreath, branches of which fall in the
                    field about him. A winged woman at left runs left, looking back at Salmoneus.
                    The upper sections of her wings are dotted. She wears a spiral bracelet. A woman
                    at right stands facing left and leans away from Salmoneus. Both women wear
                    chiton and himation, the chiton of the one pleated, of the other dotted; both
                    lift their skirts fastidiously as they move; both have bands (the one at right
                    with leaves) encircling their long hair, the hair tied back at the ends. Red
                    paint was used for the women's head-bands, the wreaths, chains, and branches on
                    and about Salmoneus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> A woman stands to right
                    flanked by two Nikai, all three figures enveloped in himatia worn over chitons.
                    The Nike at left is turned away from the other two figures. The Nike at right
                    stands frontal, her head turned to the woman, her wings spread out on each side;
                    both raise their hands under their himatia. The frontal Nike has her hair bound
                    up in a bun with two red-painted bands; the other figures have their long hair
                    tied at the ends, long tresses of hair in thin glaze escaping over the shoulder
                    of the winged one; all have redpainted bands around their heads.</p>
                <p>Relief outline was used sparingly on the obverse, except on
                    Salmoneus, where it is everywhere except for his hair and beard. There is no
                    relief outline on the reverse. Thin glaze was used extensively on both sides for
                    outline and for inner detail. Preliminary outlines are visible. Sketch marks
                    show on all figures, and indicate particularly that the chins of both women on
                    the obverse were started higher.</p>
                <p>It has long been agreed that the story of Salmoneus, current in fifth
                    century Athens, accords with the picture shown here, although it is always
                    possible that the scene is from a story which has not come down to us. A satyr
                    play by Sophocles and a picture of Salmoneus by the mural painter Polygnotos
                    have been cited as inspiration for the vase-painting (<bibl
                       >Robert, <title>infra</title></bibl> and <bibl
                       >M. Robertson 1975</bibl>. Salmoneus, a son of
                    Aeolus of Thessaly, is said to have founded a city in Elis, in the northwestern
                    Peloponnese, where Olympia is located. He became so arrogant that he began to
                    ape Zeus, simulating thunder and throwing objects about as thunderbolts until
                    Zeus bolted him with the real thing. Here then we would have Salmoneus about to
                    cast his pseudo-bolt, his derangement (for so his insolence would be considered
                    by the ancients) indicated by the fillets and wreaths bound round him, the
                    broken shackle at his ankle, the greave worn on his arm instead of his leg, the
                    sword in his left hand (cf. Robertson, <hi rend="ital">GRBS</hi>,
                    infra). The effect is heightened by the rendering of his eye with a circle and
                    dot for pupil and iris, the conventional form of eye for the wild Herakles. The
                    sword has troubled interpreters, but why more so than armor? Zeus carried
                    neither. Fillets are used to deck victors at the games, and possibly the winged
                    figure at left is Victory, <hi rend="ital">Nike,</hi> deserting the
                    manic. She has also been seen as Iris, winged messenger of the gods. The woman
                    at right may be Sidero, a wife of Salmoneus, or his daughter, Tyro.</p>
                <p>An earlier interpretation has it that the central figure is another
                    son of Aeolus, Athamas, who also went mad. His story has to do with sacrifice,
                    for which fillets, wreaths, and shackles are also appropriate, but must be
                    stretched to include a thunderbolt (<bibl>Gardner
                            <title>infra.</title></bibl>) Are the Nikai on the other
                    side of the vase related to the winged figure on the obverse? The scenes need
                    not be connected, but Nikai were popular in vase-painting of the time (cf. <rs
                        type="vase">Champaign 70.8.4</rs>), and the winged woman on the
                    obverse probably prompted the painter to wing two of the usual three cloaked
                    figures on the reverse.</p>
                <p>Aeolus spawned an interesting family of myths. Athamas fathered
                    Phryxis and Helle who rode across to Asia on a golden ram, giving name to the
                    Hellespont and rise to the story of the Golden Fleece. Another of Aeolus' sons,
                    brother to Salmoneus and Athamus, was Sisyphos, who is known for the punishment
                    he endured in perennially having to roll a stone uphill, only to have it roll
                    down again before reaching the top; it is possible that a picture on a column
                    krater in Mittelschreiberau (<bibl>ARV2, 243, no.
                    5</bibl>) by another Mannerist painter refers to this story (cf. also <bibl
                       >Moon 1979, no. 78</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The attribution of this vase turns on the relationships of the
                    Mannerist painters (see <rs type="vase">Detroit 63.13</rs> and <rs
                        type="vase">Detroit 24.120</rs>) and the Alkimachos Painter
                    with the Pan Painter. The spirit of the vase follows the Pan Painter's better
                    works, the style of drawing his lesser works. In 1912 Beazley attributed a
                    column krater, now <rs type="vase">New York 10.210.14</rs>, to the
                    Pan Painter (<bibl><title
                        >JHS</title> 32 [1912] 355, no. 6</bibl>). In 1918 he separated it from that
                    painter but did not group it with the Mannerists, whom he discussed at the same
                    time (<bibl>Beazley 1918, 118</bibl>). In the same
                    publication he noted that the Alkimachos Painter was influenced by the Pan
                    Painter, but particularly by one of his better pieces (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1918, 136</bibl>). Later the New York krater was
                    given to a Mannerist, the Chicago krater to the Alkimachos Painter (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1925, 250, no. 41 and 298, no.
                    33</bibl>). By 1928 Beazley had connected the Chicago vase with the New York one
                        (<bibl>Beazley 1928b</bibl>, infra), and
                    finally, in <bibl>ARV1, (infra)</bibl>, attributed
                    our column krater to a painter of the Mannerist workshop. To list the details in
                    which the style shows the influence of the Pan Painter would be to describe the
                    vase over again: compare such figures as those on his small pelikai and his
                    figures wrapped in himatia (so-called "mantle" figures).</p>
                <p>The shape of the vase and the treatment of subsidiary decoration
                    direct the attention to the Mannerist workshop. The rim and handle-plates of a
                    Mannerist column krater are usually quite flat. The foot is characterized by the
                    angular profile of the upper degree, which is often as high as, if not higher
                    than, the torus-shaped lower degree. The lotus decoration, particularly that of
                    the neck, is characterized by the bean-shaped lower tendrils which do not cross
                    each other. There are column kraters of Mannerist shape and subsidiary
                    decoration which are not painted by Mannerists, as indeed one in Ruvo in the
                    manner of the Alkimachos Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 553,
                        no. 4</bibl>), but it is likely that they were made in the Mannerist shop.
                    Contrast the shape and decoration of one by the Alkimachos Painter himself, <rs
                        type="vase">Bologna 236</rs> (<bibl
                        >ARV2, 532, no. 44</bibl>). The Pan Painter's own column kraters were not
                    shop-shape and do not form a homogeneous group. They often find interesting
                    parallels outside the circle of the Mannerists, as for instance in the Cleveland
                    Painter's namepiece, <rs type="vase">Cleveland 30.104</rs>.</p>

                    upright and pendent palmettes connected by tendrils. The obverse picture is
                    framed above by tongues at the join of neck and body, at the sides by a palmette

                    and a bearded man proceed to a party, or rather from ‚Äî they are already
                    quite jovial. All are naked and wear shawls around their shoulders. The leader
                    turns around to hurry the others on; one plays the lyre while the bearded man
                    and a youth dance in back of him.</p>
                <p>This very large column krater is the name-piece of the Cleveland
                    Painter. Only eleven other vases are attributed to him, most of them column
                    kraters. The subjects he chose are common for the shape: the Cleveland chariot
                    scene, a vintage, centauromachies, komasts, Dionysos and his retinue. He
                    evidently liked the alternating palmettes with which he decorated the obverse of
                    the Cleveland vase ‚Äî they appear on several other column kraters and on
                    an oinochoe by him. The same pattern decorates the rim on the obverse of a
                    column krater (<rs type="vase">Bologna 229</rs>), by the Pan
                    Painter (<bibl>ARV2, 551, no. 18</bibl>); the
                    tongues above the obverse picture are carefully scalloped, those above the
                    reverse picture simple stripes, as on the Cleveland vase. This vase too is very
                    large (54.5 cm high), the foot is similar in form to that of the Cleveland
                    krater, and the picture on the obverse is also a chariot scene. The reverse
                    shows men and youths, draped in himatia, conversing. The head, features, and
                    treatment of hair on the youth at left are very near that of the youth at left
                    on the Cleveland reverse-they could be brothers. Beazley noted that the
                    Cleveland Painter's work shows the influence of the Pan Painter, and first
                    listed one of his vases under "style of the Pan Painter" (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1925, 470, addendum to p. 105</bibl>, now <bibl
                       >ARV2, 517, no. 8</bibl>). The Cleveland Painter
                    in fact received his "identity" in a footnote in Beazley's monograph on the Pan
                    Painter (<hi rend="ital">Pan-Maler, infra</hi>).</p>
                <p>The Cleveland Painter crosses paths with another early classical
                    painter of column kraters, the Orchard Painter: oinochoai by both painters have
                    been recognized as works of one potter (<bibl>ARV2,
                        517, nos. 11 and 527, no. 74</bibl>; cf. also <rs type="vase"
                        >University of Chicago 1967.115.410</rs> on the subsidiary decoration of
                    these oinochoai and through it note a further connection with the Pan Painter,
                    who also seems to have influenced the Orchard Painter at times).</p>
                <p>The round heads, heavy jaws, solid bodies of the Cleveland Painter's
                    figures are typical of the art of the early classical period.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 39.5 cm; d. 37.0 cm.
                    Restorations in neck and several parts of figures; unrestored damage to left

                    of belly into shoulder.</p>
                <p>The rounded body merging into the shoulder without a sharp break is
                    the typical <hi rend="ital">kalpis</hi> form, which begins in the
                    late sixth century and continues into the fourth, with a gradual narrowing of
                    the body. The offset foot curves outward.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The subject is one of
                    the twelve labors of Herakles, the theft of the golden apples of the Hesperides.
                    Herakles moves rapidly toward the left, three apples held against his body in
                    his left hand and his club swung over his head as if for attack. He looks back
                    at one of the Hesperides, who pursues him; a second maiden looks toward the
                    fleeing hero, while a third faces an apple tree around which the guardian dragon
                    is entwined. Herakles wears a short chiton and his familiar lion-skin headdress,
                    while the maidens wear long chitons and himatia; drapery folds are drawn in
                    straight, often irregular lines. The maiden next to Herakles wears the sakkos
                    headdress while the one on the right has a simple cap; the central maiden is
                    bareheaded with a fillet around her hair. The tree at the right still bears
                    fruit on its spreading branches, which extend from both sides of the trunk. The
                    dragon has the form of a bearded serpent, its mouth open as if expostulating
                    with the maiden who faces it.</p>
                <p>The poses suggest rapid movement; Herakles' quick turn is emphasized
                    by the tiptoe pose of his left foot, and the central maiden, with one frontal
                    and one profile foot, seems also in the act of turning. The swinging skirts and
                    widespread feet of the other two Hesperides likewise indicate vigorous activity.
                    The tree forms a frame at the right, and Herakles' turn toward the center tends
                    to close the composition on that side.</p>
                <p>Although the liveliness gives interest to the scene, the drawing is
                    mediocre in quality. The women's figures are bulky and ungraceful with enormous,
                    cursorily drawn hands and feet, and heavy faces. Scarcely any sign of body
                    conformation appears under the loose garments. Herakles is somewhat better
                    proportioned, but the drawing of his body, also, is far from good. Contours are
                    blurred, gestures clumsy and exaggerated.</p>
                <p>The hero Herakles is probably the most frequently portrayed figure in
                    Greek art, and the twelve labors which he performed for King Eurystheus are
                    depicted in both sculpture and painting from the seventh century into
                    Hellenistic times. However, all the labors did not enjoy popularity with the
                    artists. On vases, the killing of the Nemean lion is easily the most common
                    labor shown, and the theft of the apples of the Hesperides one of the least
                    common. The reasons for this disparity are unknown, but there seems to be a
                    preference for those labors which show violent action, especially combat, and
                    the Hesperides scene offers no opportunity for that. When the theft is shown,
                    Herakles is usually seen standing in the garden with the maidens, but the
                    depiction of the moment after the theft, as seen on the Krannert hydria, is
                    unusual. Traditions differ as to the number of maidens guarding the apples, but
                    three is a number commonly given.</p>
                <p>The Syracuse Painter belongs to the Early Classical phase of the
                    red-figure technique, c. 480-450 B.C. He is a pot-painter rather than a
                    cup-painter and prefers vessels of fairly large size. The attributions made by
                    Beazley show a consistent style with strong resemblances to the Krannert hydria:
                    rather large figures with little interest shown in the human body, harsh drawing
                    of folds, clumsy hands and feet, and a certain rough vigor (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 517-521</bibl>). Other works of the Syracuse Painter
                    resembling the Krannert vase are, <bibl>Richter

                    his head, with the loose ends pulled through the fillet forming loops at the
                    sides of his head. His outspread himation covers his raised right arm and he
                    holds a black skyphos in his left hand. The third figure, a man, sings while
                    accompanying himself on a lyre. The fourth, a man who dances and sings with his
                    head thrown back, must have held a krotala in both hands, although his right
                    hand is lost below the wrist. The figure on the far right is a nude boy who
                    holds a T-topped staff in his right hand and a basket over his left shoulder.
                    All wear wreaths. The men and youth wear himatia with black borders. Part of the

                    The second figure from the left, a man, stands facing right and leans forward on
                    a T-topped staff. He sings to the music played by the next figure, a girl
                    dressed in a chiton and himation who stands facing the second figure and playing
                    the pipes. Behind her, the fourth figure, a youth, dances toward her but looks
                    back right toward the figure on the far right, a man who leans on a T-topped
                    staff while vomiting. A basket hangs in the field next to him. All wear wreaths
                    and the fourth and fifth figures have fillets tied around their heads. The men
                    wear himatia with black borders; the himation of the second figure has dotted

                <p>Attributed by Dietrich von Bothmer (<bibl
                        >Para., 370, no. 12 bis</bibl>). The Foundry Painter is ranked by Beazley as
                    the principal member of the circle of the Brygos Painter (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 400</bibl>). He says of him, "The Foundry Painter is an
                    excellent artist: with his forcible, sometimes even brutal, style he often
                    equals the Brygos Painter." The painter's namesake vase, a cup in the Staatliche
                    Museen, <rs type="vase">Berlin F 2294</rs>, shows a sculptor's
                    workshop in which steps in the process of casting, assembling and finishing a
                    bronze statue are depicted. The Foundry Painter is noted for these scenes of
                    craftsmen, but he also handles scenes of athletes, warriors, banqueters and
                    komasts (as on this cup) with spirit and originality. His detailed rendering of
                    the animated revelers and their various stages of intoxication on the Toledo cup
                    shows acute observation and an earthy sense of humanity. Even the inscriptions
                    in the fields above the figures on the interior and exterior of this cup are
                    assemblages of Greek letters, not as actual words, but rather as indications of
                    the slurred sounds and humming of the drunken revelers as they sing and dance to
                    the music.</p>
                <p>Another of the Foundry Painter's cups (<rs type="vase"
                        >Berlin F 3198</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 402, no. 13; AA
                        [1982] 101</bibl>) is close in style to the Toledo cup and has the same
                    subject, a komos. Beazley remarked that the Berlin cup as a komos by the Foundry
                    Painter, "could be set beside the Brygos painter's komoi" (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1918, 94</bibl>). Later Beazley cited the Toledo
                    komos in making a further comparison between the two painters ("Un realista
                    greco," <hi rend="ital">infra</hi>).</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 29 cm; max. d. 9.0 cm;
                    d. of mouth 5.2 cm; d. of foot 6.9 cm. Intact; brush marks and slight streaking
                    of glaze, misfiring on the reverse of body and foot; minor pitting and flaking
                    under handle. Type 2 lekythos with fillet and incision between body and foot.
                    Inside of neck glazed; pouring surface, edge and underside of foot reserved. The
                    resting surface is flat except for a small, shallow conical depression at the
                    center. Small vent above left wing of figure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Winged female figure
                    strides right, carrying a fillet (in applied white, now faded) in her
                    outstretched arms. The wings of the female extend onto the shoulder of the
                    lekythos. The figure is positioned on a groundline composed of an uneven
                    arrangement of pairs of stopped meander-patterns (r.), separated by a single
                    cross-square, the corners filled (dotted) with an additional cross-square at the
                    right end of the line. A thin band of close vertical strokes, with a reserved
                    line above, accentuates the flare at the base of the neck. The figure wears an
                    Ionic chiton and short himation, some of the folds of which, on the left sleeve
                    and on the overfold, are in yellow dilute; the right sleeve is decorated with
                    rows of x's between groups of pleats, the hem is bordered with a band of dots.
                    Her hair is bound up with a dotted band. The tops of the wings are dotted.
                    Around her right arm is a spiral bracelet. Thick relief lines: right thumb,
                    lower edge of left sleeve, eyebrow, nape of neck, scalloped edges (top and
                    bottom) of overfold and upper edge of right wing. The hair is outlined in
                    reserve. Except in a few areas the figure is outlined in relief, giving sharp
                    separation from the field. The figure's hands are reversed.</p>
                <p>The concept of Nike, who the winged figure surely is, may have been
                    accepted by the middle of the sixth century, because of the Panathenaic games,
                    or before. The first Nike actually to be named on a vase is not until 530 B.C.,
                    on a Nikosthenic amphora now in Rome (<bibl
                        >Isler-Ker√©nyi 1969, p. 32</bibl>). She is a personification who
                    brings the message of victory from the gods to the recipient, with great speed
                    because of her gift of flight. In early Greek literature and thought, her
                    identity and genealogy are confused: in Hesiod (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 383-384"
                       >Hes. Th. 383-384</bibl>) she is the daughter of
                    the Titan, Pallas, while in the <bibl n="Orphic Hymn 88, 4f."
                       >Orphic Hymn 88, 4f.</bibl>, Ares is named as her father. In
                    Bacchylides (<bibl n="Bacchyl. Ep. 11.4">Bacchyl.
                        11.4ff.</bibl> she is a messenger of Zeus, the ultimate giver of victory,
                    later, she became the embodiment of victory herself, eventually to be worshipped
                    as a goddess (first at Elis in the mid-fourth century B.C.). Some feel her
                    origin in Greek art can be traced to Near Eastern influence where winged
                    mythological types are more common (<bibl>Akurgal
                        1966, 183-195</bibl>). In red-figure vase-painting, she appears frequently
                    after the Persian Wars, ca. 479 B.C., visible clarion of civilization's defeat
                    of the Persian barbarian. On these vases she is often shown carrying prizes to
                    the victor ‚Äî amphora, fillet, tripod or wreath ‚Äî or, in some
                    instances, sacrificial implements so that the recipient may return in proper
                    measure the favor that the gods have bestowed (cf. the Nikai on the column
                    krater, <rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.16</rs>). For a most recent
                    discussion of Nike: <bibl>Isler-Ker√©nyi
                    1969</bibl>.</p>
                <p>This is certainly the lekythos which is added to the work of the
                    Painter of Palermo 4 in <bibl>Para.</bibl> It has
                    been claimed that the vase was painted by the Pan Painter, who is careless and
                    clumsy at times, but never like this; the line alone could not be his. Two
                    standard-type lekythoi near the Pan Painter, <rs type="vase">Oxford
                        313</rs> and <rs type="vase">Oxford 314</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 560, nos. 6 and 7</bibl>), may have
                    prompted the attribution: the maeander and cross-square borders, the winged
                    Nikai, chitons decorated with x's and upper wings dotted, spiral bracelets, hair
                    similarly bound up, the long lines of the chins. They are of course
                    contemporary, and so is a lekythos in Palermo recalling the Triptolemos Painter
                        (<bibl>ARV2, 367, below</bibl>) to whom Beazley
                    saw a resemblance in the Oxford vases (<bibl>CVA, GB
                        3, Oxford 1, pl. 33</bibl>). The Triptolemos Painter has connections with
                    Douris, and so does the Cartellino Painter whose lekythos, <rs type="vase"
                       >Athens 1633</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 452,
                        no. 4</bibl>), has a flavor of the Elvehjem one, although it is decorated
                    somewhat differently. The decoration of the Athens lekythos is typical of the
                    so-called BL Class, from a large long-lived workshop which produced both
                    black-figure and red-figure lekythoi ‚Äî that of the Athena and Bowdoin
                    Painters. One of the characteristics of BL decoration is the band of bars on the
                    neck instead of the more usual tongues. The bars on the Elvehjem lekythos, and
                    on others by the Painter of Palermo 4, and the resemblance in style to the
                    Bowdoin Painter's own work (cf. <bibl>Kurtz 1975,
                        pl. 15</bibl>) make it likely that the Painter of Palermo 4 had some
                    connection with that shop, although Beazley had not actually formed the
                    painter's oeuvre by detaching it from the Bowdoin Painter, as Arias implies in
                        <bibl>EAA, v, 873</bibl> (see <bibl
                       >J.D. Beazley, <title>Greek Vases in
                        Poland</title> [Oxford 1928] 18f. and 79, addendum to p. 19</bibl>). Another
                    contemporary artist who painted lekythoi of the BL type is the Providence
                    Painter. His Nike on a lekythos in (<rs type="vase">New York
                        07.286.67</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 641, no. 90</bibl>)
                    spreads her wing across the shoulder of the vase like the Elvehjem Nike does.
                    This was habitual for winged figures on lekythoi with undecorated shoulders
                        (<bibl>Caskey &amp; Beazley, 41</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Elvehjem lekythos is a small window with a big view onto a major
                    workshop of lekythos painters with which some of the most important artists of
                    the time can be linked, no matter how different their styles. The view includes
                    a glimpse of the interactions in the potter's quarter of Athens, which must have
                    been a close but not closed community.</p>

                <p>The Triptolemos Painter decorated both large vases and cups. He is
                    connected with the cup-painter Douris by a signature, by certain aspects of
                    subsidiary decoration and by potterwork (<bibl>ARV2,
                        360</bibl>). There is evidence that he worked for the potters Euphronios,
                    Python, Brygos, and, in the case of the Toledo cup, for Hieron. In this cup one
                    can see both his careless and his careful work: contrast the drawing of the
                    meander bordering the tondo and that of his figure work. On other cups, in
                    scenes of the palaestra, the Triptolemos Painter shows athletes jumping,
                    athletes throwing the discus, and athletes victorious.</p>

                    12.2 cm; d. of rim 7.2 cm; d. of foot 8.8 cm. Intact. The black glaze has mostly

                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Atalanta wears a
                    himation and a long, transparent but beautifully bordered chiton, the hem of
                    which she daintily lifts with her left hand to facilitate her running. She is
                    chased by three individualized Erotes on the wing, each carrying ornate tendrils
                    and one a garland as well. The lower border alternates two clockwise meanders
                    with one checkerboard. The upper border alternates two clockwise meanders with a
                    single, dotted foursquare. The shoulder is decorated with palmettes, and on the
                    neck, a tongue pattern. (On the unique decoration of this vase, see <bibl
                       >Kurtz 1975, pp. 29 ff., and 78, n. 2</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Beazley dated the vase 500-490 B.C. and indeed both in composition
                    and in detail the vase fits well into this period. The figures are given some
                    breathing space and great attention is paid to complex embroidery patterns and
                    delicate, curvilinear floral vines. The frontal Eros displays hook-ended
                    clavicles or collarbones and the two other Erotes and Atalanta bear the oblique
                    ankle designations which are Douris' trademarks during this period. The pose of
                    Atalanta's upper body and the drawing of her face are very similar to the Athena
                    on the Vienna kylix, <rs type="vase">Vienna 3695</rs>, dated to
                    Douris' early middle period. The borders on both these vases with their double
                    meanders are precociously ornate for their dates.</p>
                <p>Jos√© D√∂rig has pointed out the nearly identical
                    proportions of the Cleveland lekythos to a similar vase in a Swiss private
                    collection and concludes that they were both made by the same potter (<bibl
                       >J. D√∂rig, <title>Art
                            Antique, Collections prive√©s de Suisse romande</title> [Mainz
                        1975] no. 205, pp. 179-182</bibl>). The vase is in a private collection in
                    Geneva. The scene itself, the arming of two hoplites, is far less kinetic than
                    the Atalanta scene. Yet the drawing of figures and drapery and especially of the
                    shoulder decoration demands a date contemporary with the Atalanta vase.</p>
                <p>The exact meaning of the main scene on the Atalanta lekythos is
                    unclear. The central action takes place between Atalanta running towards the
                    right (the direction of victory) while she glances back over her shoulder toward
                    the well-muscled Eros, who stretches to overtake her. Boulter believes that this
                    Eros is taunting Atalanta with the alternatives of Love should she decide to
                    lose her race. Eros holds the garland representing the joys of Love in his left
                    hand and in his right hand he holds an improperly restored flail representing
                    the torments of Love (See <bibl>CVA, p. 21</bibl>).
                    Atalanta flees from him, reaching out her right hand to stave him off, "while
                    flying from delightful wedlock, gift of golden Aphrodite" (<bibl
                        n="Theognis, 1283-1294">Theognis,
                    1283-1294</bibl>). She seems not to realize that there are still two more Erotes
                    awaiting her around the body of the lekythos.</p>
                <p>It is this need for the cylindrical shape of the lekythos to portray
                    the drama of Atalanta's race that drew Douris away from his unusual form, the
                    kylix. The sharply curving surface isolates the scene into facets; the
                    overlapping of these facets causes the observer to turn the vase, thereby
                    instilling movement into the drama.</p>
                <p>The action begins just to the left of Atalanta with the powerful
                    upward diagonal of a lavishly articulated Eros. His body stretches around nearly
                    one-half of the vase's circumference. The forceful 45-degree angle of his body
                    directs the observer's gaze from the toes of his right foot through his torso to
                    the moment of interaction between Atalanta and himself at the intersection of
                    their two arms. Atalanta's running figure covers more than a quarter of the vase
                    on the most important side opposite the handle. The second Eros awaits to the
                    right. The observer is drawn into turning the vase toward this new figure by the
                    upward curving lines of Atalanta's heavily bordered skirt-hems below, by the
                    windblown curve of her head cloth above, and by the direction of her race. The
                    third, a red-haired Eros, hovers on the back of the vase below the handle, and
                    seems capable of turning in either direction. He is closer to the second Eros
                    behind him yet he is separated from the first Eros, whom he faces, by a series
                    of tendrils. Thus, compositionally, he provides a two-directional link
                    completing the circle and continuing the conundrum of Atalanta's race.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions are as follows: above and to the right of her head;
                    above the heads of the first and third Erotes; and in reverse in front of the
                    second Eros. In his review of Boulter's <bibl>CVA,
                        USA 15, Cleveland 1</bibl>, Frank Brommer suggested that all of the
                    inscriptions might not be entirely ancient and that the name of Atalanta might
                    be an imperfect restoration of the name Aphrodite (<bibl
                       >F. Brommer, review in <title>Gnomon</title>
                        46 (1974) 426-7</bibl>). Cedric Boulter replied that under ultra-violet
                    examination the inscription appears untouched (<bibl
                        >C. G. Boulter, "The Douris Lekythos in Cleveland," <title
                            >AJA</title> 79 [1975] 282-3</bibl>). Furthermore, it is far more
                    plausible to consider Atalanta, rather than Aphrodite, as fleeing from the
                    Erotes.</p>

                    face of the maenad who is behind. Glaze streakily applied in the field of the
                    shoulder scene, between the giant's legs and elsewhere. Glaze fired red-green on
                    the back of the vase, on the handle, top of foot and, slightly, beneath picture

                <p>On the most recently acquired vase in Cleveland, Douris once again
                    employs the strong curve of the lekythos shape to heighten the impact of the
                    scene. Here Douris portrays the death of the giant Enkelados at the hands of
                    Athena in the legendary war between the gods and the giants. The artist has
                    given us the most dramatic, most evanescent moment of this episode, and on this
                    vase has rendered it timeless. Athena, intent on her prey, strides purposefully
                    forward ready to give the coup de grace with her spear. This final blow is not
                    necessary and this the goddess knows, for victory gleams in her eye. An earlier
                    stage of the battle with the giant may be represented on the shoulder of the
                    Priam Painter's hydria in Madison (see <rs type="vase">Madison
                        68.14.1</rs>). She has already wounded Enkelados; blood is pouring from his
                    left thigh and rib cage. Douris has caught the giant just at the last
                    excruciating moment before death as he reels backward, releasing his grip on his
                    short sword, his eyes glazing over and turning skyward. Athena's emblem, the
                    Gorgon head, appears to cheer her on with its open mouth just as the centaur
                    device on Enkelados' shield futilely enjoins the giant to keep up the battle. He
                    shouts encouragement to Enkelados and lifts a barely visible branch as a
                    replacement to the giant's fallen arms. This seems to be a unique depiction of a
                    Gorgon's head in profile.</p>
                <p>The shoulder is decorated with three figures ‚Äî a satyr flanked
                    by two maenads. Palmettes and tendrils fill the rest of the shoulder to the
                    handle. The base of the neck is bordered with a tongue-pattern.</p>
                <p>The main scene covers less than two-thirds the circumference of the
                    vase. The action unfolds from left to right with Athena in one quadrant striding
                    toward her victory with the giant's broken spear forming a compositional element
                    which ties the goddess spatially to her quarry. The angle of the spear is echoed
                    in the giant's body by the strong diagonals of his left leg and his right arm
                    and short sword. As one turns the vase the giant's already contorted body seems
                    to twist all the more since its axis is curved around the body of the vase.</p>
                <p>Athena's profile, the form of her hair, and the drawing of her ear
                    are close to that of Eos on the famed Louvre Eos and Memnon cup (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 434, no. 74</bibl>). The drawing of her
                    eye and the giant's eyes is typically Dourian as are the hooks of the
                    collarbones on the satyr in the shoulder scene. Athena's drapery is like neither
                    the group of tightly clumped, brittle lines on The Eos and Memnon nor the more
                    generously spaced folds of such vases as <rs type="vase">Berlin F
                        2289</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 435, no. 95</bibl>). On
                    both the Cleveland gigantomachy lekythos and the Atalanta vase, Douris seems
                    primarily interested in drawing rows of curving triangles at the bottoms of
                    pleats. On such vases where he paid attention to hemline details he created
                    drapery which is at once weighty and graceful.</p>
                <p>Douris' composition may have been influenced by the central pediment
                    group from the Old Hekatompedon now in the Acropolis Museum, Athens. There,
                    Athena inflicts the coup de grace on Enkelados who lies defenseless on the
                    ground. While the sculptural group does not lack power, the curve of the
                    red-figure lekythos gives Douris' drawing an impact inconceivable in any other
                    medium.</p>
                <p>Although the subject of the War of the Gods and Giants was an old
                    favorite in its own right, it is entirely possible that during the last years of
                    the sixth century B.C. and the beginning of the fifth, this subject matter took
                    on a specific political nature for Athens. With the Athenians on the side of the
                    gods and the Persians cast as giants, the iconography immediately becomes a
                    political manifesto either anticipating or illustrating Athens's victory over
                    the Persian army at Marathon in 490 B.C.</p>
                <p>Athens's victory over the giant does not necessarily support a date
                    immediately after 490 B.C. It could be argued, if the political connection is
                    accepted at all, that such a scene was pictured in the hope of victory.
                    Stylistic evidence does, however, support a post-490 date. While the care taken
                    with the textile patterns is reminiscent of the Atalanta vase of 500-490 B.C., I
                    have shown earlier the similarity between the drawing of Athena's face and that
                    of Eos on the later Louvre cup. The palmette decorations on the shoulder
                    approach the style of the later cups such as the Cleveland Douris kylix dated to
                    480 or after. Thus, a date just after the battle at Marathon and therefore
                    celebrating that victory would be realistic for the lekythos.</p>
                <p>The ghosts of two inscriptions remain: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*A*Q*E*N*A*A</foreign> (Athena) above her shield; <foreign

                    reverse beginning at the tip of the giant's helmet crest and running parallel to
                    the left half of his broken spear. Although the double A in Athena's name is
                    unusual it appears as well on the Geneva white-ground lekythos compared in our

                    <hi rend="ital">Tondo:</hi> full-striding figure of Dionysos with a
                    satyr skipping merrily behind him. Dionysos, holding the end of a
                    long-tendrilled grapevine in his left hand and a kantharos in his right, casts a
                    startling glance back over his right shoulder at the satyr who appears to have
                    just slapped the god on his back. Max Wegner points out the amusing
                    juxtaposition of these two figures ‚Äî the massive, dour figure of
                    Dionysos, and the light-hearted satyr who attracts as much attention for his
                    spirited antics as does the god by the space he fills (<bibl
                       >Wegner 1968, 155</bibl>). Both figures are set on a ground
                    line, the space below reserved in red clay. The border alternates single
                    meanders and saltire squares; the meanders with minor exceptions run alternately
                    clockwise and counterclockwise.</p>
                <p>The exterior is decorated with figures of satyrs and maenads,
                    arranged alternately, a group of five figures on each side, and complex
                    palmette-designs at each handle. Wegner analyzes these compositions in depth in
                    a comparison with six other cups bearing Dionysiac scenes (<bibl
                       >Wegner 1968, pp. 156ff.</bibl>). As in the tondo scene,
                    Douris has played off the naked, raucous satyrs against the heavily clad, more
                    ponderous female figures.</p>
                <p>Douris's favorite vase-shape by far was the kylix. Beazley in <hi
                        rend="ital">ARV2</hi> and <hi rend="ital"
                        >Paralipomena</hi>, lists 256 cups and cup-skyphoi to a mere 24 examples of
                    all other shapes combined in Douris' oeuvre. It is surprising then, that of the
                    three Douris vases in Cleveland, only one should be a kylix and the other two
                    lekythoi.</p>
                <p>In 1915 the kylix was put on permanent loan to the Museum from the
                    estate of Hinman B. Hurlbut. The cup, heavily restored at the time it was given
                    to Cleveland, went unrecognized until 1953 when the adhesives disintegrated and
                    the cup collapsed into a heap of sherds. These fragments were subsequently
                    divested of large areas of puritanical overpaint and rejoined. The drawing thus
                    unveiled was fine enough to spur the then curator, Sherman E. Lee, to send
                    photos to Sir John Beazley who wrote back, "... the red-figured cup is a very
                    good and important piece, the work of Douris in his late middle-period, about
                    480 or a little after." See <bibl>S. E. Lee, "A Cup
                        by Douris," <title>AJA</title> 58 (1954) 230, pls. 41,
                    42</bibl>. Letter from J. D. Beazley, dated March 17, 1953. See also <bibl
                       >ARV2, 436, no. III</bibl>.</p>
                <p>The collection of vases in Cleveland was not a particularly
                    impressive one, and perhaps Beazley was being kind in his assessment, for the
                    kylix is only a rather typical example of Douris' later work. The subject matter
                    on all sides is perfectly straight-forward for this period.</p>
                <p>Douris' drawing is best in the tondo figures, especially Dionysos'
                    face, the satyr's kicked-up left foot, and in the left-hand satyr figures in
                    both scenes of the underside of the cup. Other areas are either obscured by
                    damage or are rather clumsily or casually drawn. The tight, patterned groups of
                    lines for drapery folds and the heavily drawn hemlines are typical for this
                    period of Douris' work, and along with the tondo border-decoration, are guides
                    for dating the cup.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 20.0 cm; d. of rim 9.3
                    cm. The vase is composed of a bowl, wheel-turned, and a plastic donkey's head,
                    molded. The head is intact but the rim is much broken and pieced at and around
                    the left ear of the donkey, and the right ear is broken and repaired; missing
                    pieces are restored with plaster. There are two large breaks in a section
                    through the upper part of the painted figures. A crack goes across the face,
                    through the mouth of the maenad, possibly taking away a relief line, then
                    continues through the chest and left wrist of the satyr. The rim is chipped in
                    places; the black piece in the palmette decoration in back of the donkey's left
                    ear replaces a missing one and is alien. There is some restoration with black
                    paint in subsidiary areas, especially around the ears. Is the maenad's right
                    hand restored? A good black glaze covers the rim and neck of the vessel inside.
                    Matt black covers the inside of the molded part, some of which has flaked off,
                    especially in the impressed areas. A wash of varying intensity, perhaps intended
                    for shading, covers the reserved areas, quite dark over figures and floral,
                    possibly meant to be brown in the area of the donkey's eyes and nose, orange in
                    the indentations over his eyes and top of his head. Marks of a smoothing tool
                    are visible over the donkey's head.</p>
                <p>The cylindrical bowl is attached just above the join of the donkey's
                    ears with its head. The one flat handle, painted black outside, reserved inside,
                    is attached on the underside of the head, with roots at the middle of the bowl
                    and between the donkey's jaws. His cheeks are quite flat and meet at a sharp
                    angle with the under part of jaw and muzzle. The area under the muzzle is
                    rendered as a tight knob of a chin. The ears, molded separately and attached to
                    lie back along the bowl, the eyes, the open mouth with its bared teeth, together
                    give the impression that the mule is straining forward, more so on the right
                    side than the left. The pupils of the eyes are placed differently, that of the
                    right side giving a fiercer impression, that of the left rather introspective.
                    The left nostril is much wider than the right. A bit of the mane was modeled
                    separately and attached just below the bowl, between the ears.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The donkey's head is
                    reserved. The ears are painted white; there is a splotchy mark in thin glaze on
                    the top of the right ear near its join with the head, clearly intended, and the
                    remains of a thin glaze line near the root of that ear, of uncertain purpose.
                    The forelock is black. The eyes are rimmed with black, the whites painted white;
                    the reserved iris is outlined in black, the pupil was painted, probably with
                    thin glaze, and outlined in a thick band of black. The whole muzzle was painted
                    white, a lot of which is lost, particularly on top: it must have been much
                    rubbed. The inside of the nostrils, the lips, and the inside of the mouth are
                    red. The teeth are white. The bridle is black and carries across the top of the
                    head in two parallel straps, across the underside of the head in two crossed
                    straps. The brow-strap is tied in loops at the cheek-strap; the nose, cheek, and
                    lower straps meet on bridle rings at the sides of the mouth.</p>
                <p>A band of dotted tongues on the outside of the slightly flaring lip
                    of the bowl borders the picture above. Meander and cross-square border the
                    picture below: two stopped, facing meander squares alternate with one so-called
                    Dourian cross-square, with an unnecessary odd-man-out at left front. The
                    meander-pattern from ear to handle on each side extends into the handle zone and
                    is outlined by a sweeping curved relief line under the handle on each side,
                    leaving a short space undecorated. Between the donkey-ears and handle are two
                    floral groupings of six palmettes. On the left are two palmettes base to base,
                    each springing from two spirals which tendril out on right and left to bound
                    them and to encircle the palmettes in which each terminates; the upper right
                    tendril of this set gives off a lotusbud and spiral below its terminating
                    palmette. On the right, the scheme is similar but the central palmettes are
                    joined by two dotted loops, which they share, instead of the four spirals.</p>
                <p>A balding, bearded, bushy-tailed, naked satyr at right, leopard-skin
                    about his shoulders, right arm up, left down, stride wide, in the archaic
                    manner, pursues a maenad to left. She races left, looks back at him, thyrsos in
                    right hand raised in defense, left arm stretched out to fend off her pursuer.
                    Her stride is enormous. She wears chiton and short himation with embroidered
                    edge, draped in the Ionic fashion. Her chiton hangs in starkly vertical folds
                    above, in roughly parallel, horizontal curves below. She wears a necklace with
                    one pendant, and on each upper arm a spiral bracelet of four turns. Her hair is
                    short. Traces of paint indicate a head-band. Her right foot, the leaved tip of
                    the thyrsos, the satyr's left foot and part of the floral are covered by the
                    donkey's ears.</p>
                <p>Contour lines are everywhere visible. Relief outline is used almost
                    everywhere, including the floral decoration and lines bounding bridle and rings.
                    The loops tying cheek-band to brow-band on the bridle, and the meander and
                    tongue decoration are not outlined. The maenad's neck is done in relief line
                    under her hair, and the reserved outline of her head has relief outline inside
                    and out; the satyr's bald head is outlined in relief, and so is his hair at
                    back, inside the reserved outline. Raised dots of paint indicate curls about the
                    maenad's cheeks and forehead, and in front of the satyr's ear. Marks through the
                    satyr's hair at the back look as if relief lines and thick paint were used to
                    indicate a wreath. Horizontal thin glaze lines on his head and brow may indicate
                    either wrinkles or a wreath. Thin glaze is used for the maenad's bracelets and
                    necklace, for inner markings of the satyr's torso and left arm, and for spots on
                    the outside of the panther skin. There was much preliminary sketching, including
                    marks for parts of the bridle. A relief line was forgotten for the hemline of a
                    pleat on the upper part of the himation over the hip, but indicated in the
                    sketch.</p>
                <p>The vase is not meant to stand on its own, except upside down, when
                    empty. If one tried to drink from it while holding it by the handle with either
                    hand, an animal ear would interfere. It can be held with the handle away from
                    the drinker, but more conveniently, in the right hand, say, with thumb under or
                    inside handle, fingers around nose, and little finger in mouth (of donkey): this
                    may account for the loss of white paint over the muzzle.</p>
                <p>Much of the following information comes from studies by Herbert
                    Hoffmann on rhyta from Athens, and from Taranto in South Italy, listed in the
                    references and bibliography below and abbreviated here as <hi rend="ital"
                       >A</hi> and <hi rend="ital">T</hi> respectively. We
                    use the term "rhyton" conventionally, for it was probably used in antiquity to
                    describe a spouted drinking horn, while such beakers as these seem to have been
                    called according to their animal form (<bibl
                        >Hoffmann 1962, 3</bibl>). By convention this head is identified as donkey,
                    not mule, by the white muzzle, the lack of forelock (not the same as the bit of
                    mane here), the ears longer than horse-ears, though not donkey length (<bibl
                       >Hoffmann 1966, p. 15</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The plastic form presents an interesting chronological problem common
                    to all moldmade sculpture-models could be taken from molds and molds from models
                    for generations. Our rhyton appears to fall into no known class of such objects,
                    and it stands apart from the potter-work of other rhyta painted by Douris (<bibl
                       >Hoffmann 1962, 15 and 45</bibl>). Its handle is
                    reserved inside, a feature apparently unique to and characteristic of Douris's
                    rhyta; the variation of color in the wash over the reserved areas occurs also on
                    his two lion-head rhyta (<bibl>Hoffmann 1962, 14 and
                        15</bibl>). The type of palmette decoration has been discussed by Jacobsthal
                        (<hi rend="ital">infra,</hi> 66 ff. and <bibl
                       >Hoffmann 1962, 45 and p. 51, n. 87</bibl>) in connection with
                    palmettes on neck-amphorae and with handle-palmettes on various shapes. It has
                    much in common with the handle-palmettes of the somewhat earlier Cleveland cup,
                        <rs type="vase">Cleveland 508.15</rs>. Notice that the leopard
                    skins of the satyr on that cup, too, are spotted only on the outsides, and there
                    is one satyr there who pursues a maenad in much the same posture as ours.<note
                        place="unspecified" anchored="true">
                        <p>"Leopard skins are normally only spotted on the outside; this
                            practice is observed on many vases by different painters." (Letter of
                            Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb. 1980)</p>
                    </note> The dress of the Chicago maenad is reminiscent of that of a slightly
                    earlier and finer maenad by Douris on the inside of a cup in (<rs type="vase"
                       >Boston 00.343</rs>: <bibl>ARV2,
                        438, no. 141</bibl>), with its horizontal folds below and vertical ones
                    above.</p>
                <p>The painting on the rhyton was first thought to be Brygan, before
                    sliding into Douris by way of his manner (<bibl>Rich
                        1931</bibl>; <bibl>ARV1</bibl>). The Brygos
                    Painter did favor the crenelated border used here on the maenad's hem, and the
                    treatment of the chiton in vertical and horizontal pleats occurs in the Brygos
                    Painter's work too. Set the Chicago vase beside a ram's-head rhyton by the
                    Brygos Painter, once in Goluchow (<bibl>ARV2, 382,
                        no. 185</bibl>): the subject matter, the subsidiary decoration, the
                    treatment of the chitons are similar, but the painters are clearly different. M.
                    Wegner, in his treatise on Douris, would detach all the rhyta from the painter's
                    oeuvre (<bibl>Wegner 1968, 217 f</bibl>), but the
                    argument is not convincing. Four rhyta besides the Chicago one are attributed to
                    Douris, two lion-heads, and two eagle-heads, all late. Three are known to be
                    from Capua, ours is from Nola, both South Italian sites. The rhyton form had a
                    brief but prolific renaissance in South Italy during the fourth century B.C.
                    Although it has been shown that Tarentine ones were used for religious and
                    funerary purposes, the Attic ones of this period seem to have been in no way
                    connected with ritual (<bibl>Hoffmann 1962, 4; T III

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; given by Professor F. B. Tarbell (1967.115.61, formerly UC 290). From
                    Athens. Received by Professor Tarbell from Mr. E. P. Warren.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. h. 3.9 cm; max. w.
                    5.1 cm; th. of wall 0.3 cm; th. of rim 0.5 cm. Part of the rim and wall from a
                    type A skyphos, with a fine shiny black glaze inside and out, and a very red
                    wash over the reserved areas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> There remains the head
                    and shoulder of a woman facing right. Her hair falls in a mass at her cheek and
                    over her forehead, combed up into a bun at the back and tied twice around the
                    bun, three times around and once across her head. She wears a disk earring with
                    a dot in the center, and a closely pleated chiton, part of which remains at the
                    right shoulder. The upper lid of her eye is shown over a circle and dot pupil.
                    The fine strands of hair pulled up at her neck, and individual strands of hair
                    within the mass behind her head, over her forehead and at her cheek are rendered
                    in relief lines. There is relief outline everywhere including the line of the
                    head inside its reserved outline. The broad preliminary contour is visible and
                    sketch lines are visible for the head-bands and her nose.</p>
                <p>This fine fragment has been associated by Beazley with the followers
                    of Douris, whose works are well-represented in the exhibition (cf. <rs
                        type="vase">Cleveland 66.114</rs>, <rs type="vase"
                        >Cleveland 78.59</rs>, <rs type="vase">Cleveland 508.15</rs>,
                        <rs type="vase">Chicago 1905.345</rs>). The woman here and the
                    woman on the fragment by the Niobid Painter, <rs type="vase"
                        >University of Chicago 1967.115.410</rs> (also from The University of
                    Chicago), are contemporary. Notice particularly the treatment of the upper
                    eye-lid on both, and compare the treatment of their hair, ears and chitons.</p>
                <p>The vase from which this fragment was broken was a deep cup, called
                    skyphos, with a flat base and two horizontal handles attached near the rim.
                    There are a number of such skyphoi by followers of Douris, most of which have
                    only one figure on each side, but some have more and it is not impossible that
                    there were one or two other figures accompanying the lady here.</p>

                    shoulder 13.1 cm; d. mouth 8.3 cm; d. of foot 8.7 cm. Broken and repaired; minor
                    strengthening of a few glaze lines and slight retouching of second white,
                    especially on left foot of matron and right foot of handmaiden. Black is dilute
                    and misfired in various places on the vase-body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Women on their way to
                    the cemetery carry baskets of funerary gifts ‚Äî fillets, ribbons and
                    lekythoi: one, a matron (r.), partly frontal, wears a black mourning cloak over
                    a red-brown sleeved peplos, while the other, possibly her maid, is shown in
                    profile (l.), dressed in a yellow-brown Doric peplos which is fastened at the
                    shoulder with an elaborate pin. The older has a diadem in her hair, the maid
                    wears a fillet and possibly more jewelry, as indicated by a row of black dots
                    above this fillet. Each woman carries a basket painted to match the other's
                    clothing; the black basket and ribbons are decorated with series of black dots,
                    the lighter basket with brown, woven meander-patterns and the ribbons with
                    zigzag designs or speckles in dilute glaze.</p>
                <p>Second white and glaze outline; the artist originally intended the
                    neck and chin of the handmaiden to be leaner as some preliminary sketch marks
                    may suggest; he also indicated the drapery patterns for the matron's mourning
                    cloak before he applied the black; red-figure palmettes on shoulder are type 1,
                    with red hearts (<bibl>Kurtz 1975, fig. 6</bibl>)
                    and egg and dot; bands of running meanders (both to right) above and below
                    figure scene, these punctuated at the fourth position with a cross-square,
                    heavily dotted (with an additional cross-square at the end, only of the bottom
                    band). The meanders do not continue around the vase but the lines bounding each
                    of the two meander zones do, completely. A love inscription is between the
                    figures: kalos (horizontally) Glaukon (vertically). While mending the vase the
                    conservator noted and photographed traces of an inner pocket or cul-de-sac which
                    once contained the precious oil; there is now no trace of an air-vent. A raised
                    fillet marks the join of the foot to the vase and the side of the foot has a
                    deeply incised ring near the top. The profile of the inner foot is conical with
                    a slightly concave center. The inside of the neck is black glaze, the flat
                    pouring surface is reserved. The underside of the foot is reserved and has
                    graffiti.</p>
                <p>The Timocrates Painter takes his name from the love inscription on a
                    vase (<rs type="vase">Oxford 267</rs>) in the Ashmolean museum,
                    Oxford, and he seems to have decorated only white-ground lekythoi. Usually he
                    prefers compositions consisting of two figures, one in profile the other
                    frontal, with little motion or physical exertion in the grouping. Otherwise
                    simple scenes are made more appealing with contrasting color, with areas of
                    lively pattern, and by well-placed inscriptions (or attributes); e.g., on the
                    Elvehjem vase, the inscription, "kalos," is placed on an orthogonal, between the
                    figures, to link them iconographically. The ladies on this vase, however, seem
                    stiffer, somewhat elongated, and have smaller heads than most of those by the
                    painter. The eyes and ears are sufficiently different to prevent a firm
                    attribution to Timocrates ‚Äî the eyes lack the iris (black dot or ellipse
                    in outline) which the painter usually supplies and the ears are not the expected
                    crescents but instead are merely kidney-shaped, with an additional are inside.
                    There are discrepancies too with the subsidiary decoration.<note

                            Cahn." (Letter of Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb.

                    </note></p>
                <p>The function of lekythoi as funerary gifts largely determined the
                    scenes painted on them; scenes showing a visit to a tomb are the most common.
                    The tall, slender neck, with its flat top and angular inner edge, was designed
                    to pour a fine, slow stream of oil, calculated to waste not a single drop.
                    Whether scented and used as perfume, as an astringent after bathing or physical
                    exercise, or for kitchen use, oil, important in life, was a fitting tribute for
                    the dead. On the Elvehjem vase the stately poses of the mourning women and the
                    horizontal accents established by their baskets are well-adapted to the vertical
                    format of the lekythos. Typical of vase-painting from 470-460 B.C. there is a
                    marked interest not only in depicting women but also in rendering details of
                    their costume with added care. This is true of the Timocrates Painter and of
                    other painters near his style, like the Penthesilea Painter and the Pistoxenos
                    Painter. In order to feature for its decorative effects the cone-shaped finial
                    of the maid's pin, the painter shows it with the head up, point down. This is
                    quite opposite to fashion and, with the sharp pin-point near the arm and chest,
                    would prove quite unpleasant for the wearer. For background: <bibl

                    left leg of the standing nude warrior; bottom of shield, back, top of buttocks
                    of the standing warrior who opposes the latter and the helmet of the kneeling
                    warrior between; the heads of the next two warriors; of the last pair, the
                    mid-section of the striding draped warrior and the head of the draped warrior
                    adjacent; much of the meander pattern beneath handle B/A.</p>

                <p>Preliminary sketch marks are visible on the cup. In the upper right
                    of the tondo, opposite the top of Theseus' club there is the design of what
                    appears to be a Chalcidian helmet. This is the same helmet worn by some of the
                    warriors depicted on the exterior, Side B; initially another subject may have
                    been intended. There is a sketch of a rope around the bull's horn; this makes
                    more understandable the position of Theseus' left hand. The painter may have
                    intended to add the lines of the rope in applied red. There are also indications
                    of a different position for the bull's front left leg and for either Theseus'
                    left arm or the bull's back. Preliminary sketch on the exterior is plentiful:
                    some lines show indecision about the placement of legs, others indicate the
                    bodies under garments and strong marks for the horse's body indicate placement
                    more to the left. Broad preliminary contour lines vary in thickness. Relief
                    contour lines for Theseus except for the top of his head and the back of his
                    hair, and for the bull everywhere except the forehead, belly near the right leg
                    and croup (close to the tail). No relief contour for terrain. Relief contour on
                    the exterior of the cup (Side A) is strong on the horse's muzzle and top of the
                    head but not the mane; also for the torso of the fallen warrior. On Side A
                    relief contour appears everywhere but not for the right leg of the nude warrior
                    nearest handle B/A, not at all for the mounted horseman, not for the arms or
                    legs of the first of the pair of draped figures nearest handle A/B, and for the
                    companion at the handle, only the exterior of his right leg has relief contour.
                    On Side B: no relief contour for the left side of the torso of the fallen
                    figure, none for the right arm of the central draped figure who is thrusting his
                    sword, nor for the lower part of both legs of the figure nearest handle B/A.
                    Relief lines everywhere on the vase, in the tondo especially high for the hero's
                    hands, ear, toes and the soles of the feet; for the bull's eye, hooves, muzzle
                    and nostril. Relief lines everywhere on the exterior, notably for the horse's
                    face, those of the fallen warrior, all hands and, on Side B, for visors of
                    helmets and floral pattern on the crown of helmet, for facial features of
                    warriors, for hands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi>
                    <hi rend="ital">Interior:</hi> a youthful Theseus raises a club in
                    his right hand to thwart the bull of Marathon (as preliminary sketch shows, in
                    his left hand he was meant to hold a rope which passed around the bull's horn).
                    Under his feet there is the suggestion of terrain, the plains of Marathon. <hi
                        rend="ital">Exterior Side A:</hi> battle. A draped warrior
                    flees to the left as a mounted warrior, dressed in chlamys and traveling hat,
                    moving to the right, aims a long spear at a fallen, kneeling nude figure. The
                    head of the latter, facing right, is shown in fine three-quarter view, his mouth
                    open and teeth exposed. Toward this disabled fellow a nude compatriot rushes to
                    the left, presumably to protect the fallen man with his shield (device: snake).
                    The battle is here between the "skins and the shirts"; the fifth and sixth
                    figures both wear the mantle which is edged with a broad stripe; one warrior
                    with sword drawn, pursues the standing nude opponent nearby. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Side B:</hi> battle. The scene is arranged in three groups.
                    Nearest handle A/B a nude warrior moves to the right, long spear in his right
                    hand, shield with apron on his left. His head is protected by a Chalcidian-type
                    helmet and he fights a pair of warriors, also nude, who face him. One opponent,
                    brandishing a sword, his left side under a shield, has fallen to his knees. He
                    and the mate standing behind, who has come to his aid, also wear the
                    Chalcidian-type helmet; the latter's has a crest and above the visor a floral
                    design. The standing warrior wields a long spear and his shield has a snake
                    emblem. A pair of combatants is next, one draped, one not. The nude man runs to
                    the left, but has turned to parry the attack of the draped warrior who has his
                    sword drawn. The chlamys or mantle has a broad stripe around the edge. The nude
                    warrior's left is protected by a shield (device: tripod) which has an apron
                    elaborately decorated with bosses and ranks of zigzags. The last pair, at handle
                    B/A, again has a draped warrior battling one who is nude. The former wears a
                    pilos, a cone-shaped helmet, the latter, as much as is preserved, carries a
                    shield and, in his right hand, a long spear which, running under the handle and
                    through the palmette, leads the viewer to the other side of the vase, to more
                    battle (For palmettes, see <rs type="vase">Oberlin 67.61</rs>).</p>
                <p>Under each handle an arrangement of palmette fans back to back, with
                    abutting scroll tendrils at the center of the configuration: under B/A the top
                    fan has eleven petals, the bottom one, nine; under A/B only the top fan is
                    well-preserved and it has ten petals. The tondo is surrounded by a border of
                    meanders, running left, punctuated approximately at the cardinal points, by
                    dotted (raised) cross-squares; the cross-square near the bull's head is
                    juxtaposed, mistakenly, onto a meander design. A meander pattern of similar
                    design borders the exterior pictures below, one dotted cross-square,
                    approximately in the center, on each side. <hi rend="ital">Light

                <p>The attribution to the painter was made recently by Dietrich von
                    Bothmer. The Penthesilea Painter was prolific (about 200 vases assigned), with
                    the quality of his production occasionally superb, often competent, and
                    sometimes disturbingly poor. The Elvehjem kylix is one of his best. Frequently
                    the exterior of his cups is of lesser quality than the interior or tondo. His
                    magnificent name-vase in Munich (<rs type="vase">Munich 2688</rs>:
                        <bibl>ARV2, 879, no. 1</bibl>) has, on the
                    exterior, a design of arming youths, drawn hastily. In quite remarkable style
                    the interior depicts Achilles slaying the Amazon Queen, Penthesilea. The
                    painter's artistry on the Madison cup is excellent, inside and out.</p>
                <p>This decorator worked in white-ground as well as red-figure and he
                    also is versatile in the choice of shapes he decorates, among them: plaques, a
                    bobbin (toy?), a kylix without a foot, one with a cover, and another with an
                    especially deep bowl. Likewise, his art is as ready to portray touches of humor
                    as it is the reality of terror. A bewildered Paris tries to evaluate the beauty
                    of three goddesses, each of whom makes "different" eyes at him, on a charming
                    white-ground pyxis in New York (<rs type="vase">New York
                    07.286.36</rs>: <bibl>ARV2, 890, no. 173</bibl>). A
                    bull seems to envision his fate as sacrifice on the interior of a cup at Oxford
                        (<rs type="vase">Oxford 1931.12</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 884, no. 73</bibl>). His best work exhibits
                    monumentality, expressiveness in the characterization of his figures and an
                    uncommonly wide range of color ‚Äî in the case of the Elvehjem kylix,
                    through the use of glazes. These virtues were learned no doubt from familiarity
                    with mural painting. The design in the tondo of the Madison cup was perhaps
                    inspired by contemporary sculpture, the metope with Herakles and the Cretan bull
                    from the temple of Zeus at Olympia.</p>
                <p>The sculptor of the metope and this decorator were faced with a
                    dilemma: in a restricted space how does one design a hero of human scale
                    proportionate to a beast, which, legend told, was of enormous size. Much like
                    the pose of the Cretan bull at Olympia, the painter has lowered the bull's head,
                    has exaggerated the rolls of flesh on the neck and compressed the powerful body.
                    The viewer left to reconstruct the body fully extended would see the size worthy
                    of the hero's special strength. Theseus was a hero of Athens, and like its hero,
                    Athens had been terrorized by Persia on the plains of Marathon; Athens, like
                    Theseus, had checked a threat and pestilence. As Louise Clark informally
                    suggests, the bull may indeed be a fitting symbol for Persia; it is often
                    depicted crowned at Persepolis. Coincidental to the victory over the Persians,
                    the bones, allegedly of Theseus, were discovered on Skyros in 476 B.C. and
                    piously moved home to Athens. The pictures on the exterior of the kylix may be
                    stock, "the shirts against the skins." Mrs. Clark mentions informally that the
                    nudity of one team may suggest an ambush. Pallas, Theseus' uncle, was anxious to
                    secure the Athenian throne for his sons and in order to achieve this, Theseus
                    was to be killed at ambush while sleeping. Laos, a herald, betrays the plot to
                    Theseus who, feigning sleep, rises and defeats his enemies.</p>
                <p>The Madison vase seems later in the painter's career. The head in
                    three-quarter view is similar to the head of the man attacking a boar,
                    represented in the tondo of a kylix assigned to the Penthesilea Painter now at
                    The Metropolitan Museum (<rs type="vase">New York 41.162.9</rs>:
                        <bibl>ARV2, 882, no. 39</bibl>). Dietrich von
                    Bothmer recognized that the fragment from the Louvre (<rs type="vase"
                       >Louvre CP 11504/B</rs>) belongs with this cup; the fragment
                    came to the Louvre in 1868, from the collection of the Marchesa di Campana.</p>

                    20.2 cm; d. of rim 21.1 cm; w. with handles 41.9 cm; max. d. 30.9 cm at 26.0 cm
                    from base; d. of foot 14.3 cm. Broken and mended, the missing pieces and cracks
                    filled with plaster. There is some painted restoration in parts of the egg and
                    dot and palmette decoration around the handles, and particularly in the figures
                    of the obverse: on the figure at left, some lines of the drapery and parts of
                    the lines on her lower right hand and finger; on the central figure, the fingers
                    of her left hand, the lower part of the ivy wreath, some lines of the drapery;
                    on the figure at right, her third finger and part of the base of her thumb, and
                    some lines of the drapery. On the reverse, there are filled gaps but no
                    repainting of lines: of the figure at left, the right hand is missing; the chin
                    and neck, the right arm and hand, and a central section of the thyrsos of the
                    central figure are missing; a section of the neck and parts of the drapery of
                    the figure at right are missing. Inside, the neck is shiny black, the vase matt
                    black. Red wash covers all the reserved areas of the vase except below the foot;
                    this shows particularly well on the outside of the foot, which has fired a
                    pink-red while the reserved areas of the figured and floral zones have fired
                    very orange; burnishing perhaps accounts for the difference in color. The lip of
                    the stamnos is grooved above and below; a fillet bordered by tooled grooves
                    joins neck and shoulder; there is a grooved line at join of body and foot and a
                    groove around the upper edge of the foot. The side of the thick disk foot is
                    reserved. The neck and handles are black.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The decoration of the
                    vase, including the handle-florals, concentrates on verticals. Bands of egg and
                    dot surround the rim and roots of the handles. There are tongues about the
                    shoulder at the join of neck and body. A band of meander and cross-square runs
                    below the figured zone all around the vase. Palmette-trees compose the
                    handle-floral. From a stem at the base-line below each handle, tendrils issue
                    upward, giving out a spiral and encircled palmettes: three palmettes below, and
                    two above the handle. In every case the middle leaf of the palmette protrudes
                    spear-like over the encircling tendril. At the handle A/B the tendril at left
                    gives off a spiral before encircling its terminating palmette, at the handle B/A
                    the tendril gives off a spiral and a lotusbud. The decorative base-line is
                    composed of groups of two stopped meanders to left separated by single
                    cross-squares. The cross-squares on the obverse have the corners filled by black
                    dots, with smaller dots between them opposite the cross-bars, leaving a
                    dentilated area around the cross. The pattern varies under the reverse picture,
                    where the first three cross-squares have only the corners dotted with black, and
                    the two cross-squares at right, dentilated as those on the obverse, are
                    separated by three meanders, not two.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Dionysiac festivities,
                    enacted by maenads, or women as maenads. A maenad, dressed in the Doric chiton,
                    open at the side with a belted over-fold, stands frontal. She is placing an ivy
                    wreath on a stamnos held out to her by a maenad at left dressed in chiton and
                    himation. Notice that the wreath is reserved on the black background, black
                    where it crosses the pictured vase. The women stand in front of a table which
                    shows between them, and on which are set an apple and a kantharos. Another
                    maenad stands frontal to right, head turned toward her companion, a thyrsos held
                    upright in her right hand. She wears chiton and himation. The maenad at left has
                    her hair bound up with three ties, the maenad at right wears an ivy wreath. The
                    central figure has a disk earring. <hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi>
                    Three women or maenads dressed in chiton and himation stand quietly, the one at
                    left holding up a drinking horn, the central one standing frontal, a thyrsos
                    held upright in her right hand, the one at right enveloped in her himation and
                    holding it up from underneath. The central figure has her hair bound up with a
                    broad band decorated with four leaves, the figure at right has her long hair
                    tied back in a pony-tail.</p>
                <p>Sketch lines are visible on all figures, showing lines of faces,
                    limbs, bodies beneath the drapery, drapery pleats. The stamnos and table on the
                    observe were also sketched in. One mark, possibly accidental, may indicate that
                    the right arm of the figure at left on the obverse was first meant to be raised
                    at a more acute angle. Relief outline is used extensively for floral, egg and
                    dot, and tongue decoration, but is rare elsewhere: the right profile of the
                    stamnos, and all of the table, are outlined, but of the figures in general only
                    parts of the arms and hands are outlined. Only the buttock of the figure at left
                    on the reverse is outlined. Around the faces it is hard to tell in some cases if
                    a nose or chin were done in relief. The accuracy of the broad preliminary
                    outline is such that the effect is almost as sharp as relief. The broad outlines
                    are particularly obvious on the reverse, where the background, except for the
                    outline, has fired greenish.</p>
                <p>Graffiti: on the sloping underside of the foot: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*A</foreign> (with two bars at the top). There are 42
                    parallel marks on the narrow resting surface of the foot, apparently
                    intentional, possibly counting-strokes.</p>
                <p>Vase-painting took several directions in the middle of the fifth
                    century. One was that of the Niobid Painter, whose work has been seen to reflect
                    the monumental painting of the time (see <rs type="vase">University
                        of Chicago 1967.115.60</rs>). The Chicago Painter's vases represent another
                    direction, the so-called "academic" wing of the Villa Giulia Painter, who is
                    connected with the followers of Douris, and whom our artist followed. The
                    Methyse Painter, whose work is shown here, (<rs type="vase"
                        >Cincinnati 1962.386-388</rs>), follows the same path (see also <rs
                        type="vase">Chicago 1892.125</rs> by the Euaion Painter).</p>
                <p>Wild excitement, violent movement, the clash of armor, were not for
                    the Chicago Painter. He continues the art of the Villa Giulia Painter "in a
                    softened and more elegant", "a somewhat freer and tenderer form" (<bibl
                       >Beazley 1918, 154</bibl> and <bibl
                       >ARV2, 628</bibl>). Though he did some kraters, some pelikai,
                    some hydriai, and a few smaller vases, we have mostly stamnoi from him.
                    Mythological scenes, pursuits, departures occur in his work, but the stamnoi by
                    him are mainly devoted to Dionysiac scenes. There are three such stamnoi in the
                    Midwest: this, his namepiece, the St. Louis stamnos (<rs type="vase"
                       >St. Louis 15.1951</rs>), and one in Minneapolis (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 631, no. 1</bibl>). "Dionysiac" in the
                    late archaic period would bring to mind the cavorting satyrs and whirling
                    maenads of Dionysos' retinue.</p>
                <p>Here rather (and on the St. Louis vase) are Athenian matrons as
                    maenads, celebrating some rite in honor of Dionysos. There is a series of
                    stamnoi with such scenes, beginning with those of the Villa Giulia Painter (see
                    Shefton in <bibl>Arias &amp; Hirmer 1962,
                    374</bibl>). Some show the figures with an idol of Dionysos, some show them
                    ladling wine, some show them dancing (as on the St. Louis stamnos, <rs
                        type="vase">St. Louis 15.1951</rs>). There has been much
                    discussion over the nature of the celebration, and whether all such paintings
                    show the same festival, and whether the participants are women or maenads.
                    Arguments have been put forward for the Lenaia, celebrated in early spring, and
                    the Anthesteria, celebrated in autumn. B. Philippaki, who studied the shape in
                        <bibl>Philippaki 1967</bibl> (the following
                    observations are to be found in the introduction, xviii to xxi), tends toward a
                    more general interpretation of the scenes: women celebrating private rites to
                    Dionysos in the autumn. She observed that stamnoi are only shown in pictures
                    painted on stamnoi (and that their particular shape corresponds to that of the
                    actual vase on which they appear); since, however, similar Dionysiac
                    representations appear on other shapes, where shapes other than stamnoi are
                    shown in use, the stamnos need not have been sacred to Dionysos. Our vase and
                    the St. Louis vase, <rs type="vase">St. Louis 15.1951</rs>, were
                    both obtained in Naples and thought to have been found in Capua. Philippaki
                    found that a surprisingly small number of examples of the shape were found in
                    Greece. Perhaps the festival portrayed is one which the Greeks of South Italy
                    celebrated. According to Philippaki, the stamnoi of the Chicago Painter were all
                    painted within a short period of time around the middle of the century and all
                    are of one type. This type is shared by certain stamnoi of the Villa Giulia
                    Painter, to whose stylistic group the Chicago Painter belongs. Philippaki raises
                    the possibility that these were perhaps made in the same workshop as stamnoi by
                    the Deepdene and Eupolis Painters, although unrelated stylistically to them
                        (<bibl>Philippaki 1967, p. 110ff. and
                    114</bibl>). It is interesting that the graffito under the foot (incomplete in
                        <bibl>Philippaki 1967, fig. 15</bibl>, where
                    only the A is shown) is similar to one under the foot of a stamnos by the
                    Deepdene Painter, which Richter interpreted as a monogram presumably indicating
                    a name beginning "AG ..." (<bibl>Richter &amp;
                        Hall 1936, v. 1,222, fig. 34, no. 83</bibl>; <bibl
                       >Philippaki 1967, p. 80 and fig. 14</bibl>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 498, no. 2 also found in Capua</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Since a lid is easily lost or separated from its vase in the course
                    of centuries (indeed, in its own useful lifetime), we are accustomed to seeing
                    the Greek vase without its intended cover which the potter and painter had
                    counted as one in their designs (cf. <bibl>von
                        Bothmer in <title>Gnomon</title> 39 [1967] 814</bibl>). The
                    stamnos was a covered vase and St. Louis is fortunate in having both parts (<rs
                        type="vase">St. Louis 15.1951</rs>). We are fortunate in being
                    able to show the two vases together, so that shape, style, and subject may be
                    compared and fully appreciated.</p>

                    (1892.125).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. with lid 13.2 cm.
                    Pyxis: h. 8.7 cm; d. of mouth 7.0 cm; d. of inset rim 7.6 cm; d. of foot 7.1 cm.
                    Lid: h. 5.0 cm; d. of rim 10.5 cm; d. of inset rim 7.8 cm. Intact, with some
                    chipping, pitting, and wear on the pyxis inside and out, particularly on edges
                    and at joins; some wear and chipping on edges of cover. In the picture zone
                    small chips and wear or disintegration affect particularly the finger of Boreas'
                    right hand, instep of his right foot, left hand of woman running right to
                    Erechtheus, midsection of Erechtheus' staff. There is good black glaze inside.
                    All reserved areas including the under-surfaces of lid and base are covered with
                    red wash. The red about the grooved circle at join of knob-stem and lid looks
                    like added red paint but may be wash. The pyxis is of type A, with concave
                    sides, flanged over the base, and a flat lid with pomegranate knob, the stem of
                    which flares to meet the lid in a tooled groove. The lid is flanged steeply at
                    the sides to meet the inset rim of the pyxis. The foot is ogee-shaped with a
                    narrow turned edge; the resting surface is reserved, its inner side black, the
                    base underneath reserved with a black circle and dot in the center.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Foot and flaring base
                    are black and so are the top and stem of the pomegranate knob. The reserved knob
                    has three black lines encircling it, reflecting the reserved lines bounding the
                    decorative borders of lid and pyxis, the black edges of all the angled portions
                    of the vase, and the black line where lid and pyxis meet. Dotted "tongues" on
                    the flanged surface above the base reflect those on the flared surface of the
                    lid's underside and those on the lid encircling the stem; they are a
                    counterpoise to the motion of the figured zone and to that of the olive wreath
                    which runs around the outer edge of the lid.</p>
                <p>On the body of the vase, Boreas, the North wind, pursues Oreithyia,
                    daughter of Erechtheus, King of Athens. Her two companions, probably her
                    sisters, flee to the king, one before Oreithyia, one away from Boreas, with
                    heads turned back to watch the pursuit. The four figures race about the vase,
                    arms and legs swung out to fill the wide spaces between them, coming to a sudden
                    halt with the stationary figure of Erechtheus, standing firm, his staff held
                    upright. Only two figures are visible at one time. Boreas is winged, with short
                    curly hair and beard. He wears the short chitoniskos. Oreithyia, hair tied up in
                    a red-painted head-band, wears the Doric chiton with overfold, open at the side.
                    The girl who runs in front wears a short sleeveless embroidered garment over her
                    chiton, her unbound curly hair windblown. The girl running left from Boreas, her
                    hair tied up in a red-painted band, wears the Doric chiton with long, belted
                    overfold, dark-bordered at the hems. Erechtheus is cloaked in a himation. His
                    hair and beard are rendered in separate strands with white paint, his crown or
                    wreath in thin glaze. Thin glaze is used for neck tendons, inner markings of
                    arms, legs, drapery, and wings, and for fringes of hair.</p>
                <p>Relief outline is infrequent and scattered: backs of necks, a
                    shoulder, a shin, a line of arm, a bit of drapery; of the faces, only the nose
                    of the woman running in front of Oreithyia is outlined. The broad contour lines
                    are visible. Sketch marks show heads, arms, legs under clothing, wings; they are
                    particularly noticeable for Erechtheus' face, and his whole body through the
                    himation. There are indications that Oreithyia's chin was started high at about
                    the level of the preserved upper lip; marks on Oreithyia's shoulders are
                    probably accidental. Marks across Boreas' upper arms look like thin glaze. A
                    compass must have been used on the lid for it appears to have slipped over the
                    wreath, where wash has collected in the groove.</p>
                <p>Boreas, the North Wind, was dear to the Athenians. He had aided them
                    against the Persians in 480 B.C., blowing a storm which wrecked the invaders'
                    ships against the Thessalian coast in northern Greece. Herodotus tells of the
                    Athenians receiving an oracle which advised them to ask help from their
                    son-in-law. They duly sacrificed to the wind, who was said to have carried off
                    their princess Oreithyia, daughter of the king Erechtheus. The paintings of the
                    following decades show Boreas pursuing Oreithyia, on a variety of vase-shapes by
                    a variety of artists. Herodotus continues his story with the Persians
                    sacrificing to Thetis the Nereid, whom Peleus was supposed to have carried off
                    from the coast where the Persian ships lay battered (<bibl n="Hdt 7.189"
                       >Hdt 7.189-191</bibl>). That pursuit too was a
                    popular subject for contemporary vase-painters. There are three versions of
                    Boreas and Oreithyia by the Euaion Painter, all late, two on pyxides, one on a
                    cup. The cup, <rs type="vase">Frankfort Mus. V.F. 406</rs> (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 796, no. 117</bibl>), has the same cast of
                    characters as the Chicago pyxis, and comparable details appear also in another
                    pursuit scene on the cup's reverse. There are similar details of dress and
                    drawing on a cup (<rs type="vase">Oxford 1927.71</rs>: <bibl
                       >ARV2, 790, no. 16</bibl>) with scenes of maenads
                    and satyrs, also a late work by the painter.</p>
                <p>The Euaion Painter, called after a kalos-name on a cup in Paris
                        (<bibl>ARV2, 789, no. 5</bibl>), was a follower
                    of Douris, belonging to the same "academic" wing of vase-painting as the Villa
                    Giulia and the Chicago Painters. Cups were his main produce, but the Chicago
                    pyxis by him has a particular significance, according to a recent study of the
                    vase-shape by Sally Rutherford Roberts (<hi rend="ital"
                    >infra</hi>). Through its shape and subsidiary decoration it connects a class of
                    pyxides by the Euaion Painter, the Chicago Painter, and other, undetermined,
                    followers of Douris, with two pyxides by the Phiale Painter, who was a pupil of
                    the Achilles Painter and a painter of Nolan amphorae and lekythoi (<bibl
                       >Roberts 1978, 96f. and 129f.</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The Achilles Painter and the Phiale Painter also wrote "Euaion kalos"
                    on several of their vases, and the name appears on other vases as well (one, a
                    contemporary white-ground lekythos in The Art Institute of Chicago). The
                    "Euaion" admired by these painters was most probably the son of the Athenian
                    tragedian Aeschylus: he is known to have had a son of that name whose age
                    accords with the chronology of the vases bearing the name, and the patronymic
                    occurs in three of the inscriptions (Beazley in <bibl
                       ><title>AJA</title> 33 (1929) 364ff.</bibl>
                    and <bibl>ARV2, 1579</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Roberts' work records some interesting observations: that the Attic
                    pyxis is derived from a Corinthian shape (as is the Attic column krater, for
                    which see <rs type="vase">Detroit 24.120</rs>); that in the fifth
                    century it was probably called kylichnis‚Äîonly much later did the word
                    "pyxis," from which our word "box" derives, become usual; that it was a woman's
                    object for holding cosmetics and jewelry; that it was used as gift for weddings
                    and funerals for both of which Boreas' pursuit was an appropriate subject,
                    "symbolic of either marriage or of death" (<bibl
                        >Roberts 1978, 9, 2ff., 179</bibl>; the quotation from 179).</p>
                <p>There is a splendid cup by the Euaion Painter in Kansas City,
                    Missouri (<bibl>ARV2, 791, no. 35</bibl>) and

                    without lid 33.1 cm; w. 37.5 cm; d. 28.0 cm; d. of mouth 21.2 cm; d. of foot
                    13.1 cm. There are four large chips on the outside of the lip above Side A.
                    There are small chips inside the mouth. The black has been rubbed along the top
                    of the mouth. On Side A there are few chips below the knee of the right maenad.
                    Under the handle on the right of Side A the palmette shows chips in the tendril
                    supporting it and a deep chip in the palmette. There are small chips on the
                    torus molding of the base. The condition is excellent.</p>
                <p>Marking the bottom of the neck is a black fillet flanked by narrow
                    red bands. The torus molding of the disk foot is reserved, as is the underside
                    of the bottom of the vase. The underside of the foot has a narrow rim, a concave
                    sloping interior with a small vertical recess with a slightly convex center, 4.7
                    cm in diameter. The interior is black. The handle of the lid is like a small
                    convex plemochoe, with a point on the top, a convex torus molding, and a
                    straight stem with a raised ridge marking its attachment to the lid. The
                    vertical side of the lid is partially black. The underside is flat with a ridge
                    which fits inside the mouth. The interior is slightly concave.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> On the lid, a wide,
                    black band encircles the torus and the stem of the knob. Radiating from the ring
                    are black rays. Then a wide, black band with, at the outer edge, straight black
                    lines, radiates from the center forming a decorative band. On the outer edge of
                    the mouth of the stamnos there is a dotted egg band flanked by grooves.
                    Radiating from the neck there is a tongue pattern within rectangles. Around the
                    junctures of the handles and the body of the vase there is a band of egg-and-dot
                    decoration framed by red lines. Above each handle a plant form terminates in
                    palmettes and spirals. Below the handle left of Side A, there are two and
                    two-thirds palmettes and spirals. Inside the handle are spirals and two flowers.
                    The handle to the right of Side A has two palmettes above and two and one-third
                    below. There is one flower within the handle. Below the scenes there are meander
                    patterns four, four and one-half, or five, interspersed with seven squares with
                    Greek crosses in saltire-squares. At the base of the stem there is a reserved
                    line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side A:</hi> Three maenads walking to
                    the left. The central maenad, who plays the aulos, is in profile to the left.
                    She wears a thin Ionic chiton marked with many vertical folds, covered with a
                    himation with weights at the bottom. An ivy wreath encircles her long hair.
                    Preceding her is a maenad similarly dressed, whose head is turned in profile to
                    her right. Her left hand holds a rhyton and her right hand holds a thyrsos. The
                    maenad on the right side of the vase, similarly dressed but wearing a tiara over
                    her long hair, is in profile walking to the left. Her right arm is extended with
                    the fingers pointing up, and her left hand holds a thyrsos.</p>
                <p><hi rend="ital">Side B:</hi> Three standing maenads wear
                    Ionic chitons covered with heavier himatia. The central maenad is in a frontal
                    position with her head in profile to her right. She is looking at a honeysuckle
                    which she holds between her right thumb and forefinger. Her left hand holds a
                    thyrsos. A wide fillet binds her long hair. The maenad on the left faces in
                    profile to the right. She wears a sakkos almost covering her hair, holds a
                    thyrsos in her right hand, and a spray of ivy in her left. The maenad on the
                    right wears a narrow fillet around her long hair, clasps her himation with her
                    left hand, and looks at a single ivy leaf held by the stem between the thumb and
                    index finger of her right hand.</p>

                    Semple Collection (1962.388, 1962.387, 1962.386). Ex Collection Curtius
                    (1962.388, fragment A); ex Collections Dr. Jacob Hirsch and Professor and Mrs.
                    Semple (1962.387, fragment B and 1962.386, fragment C).</p>

                    cm. B: h. 6.7 cm; w. 7.4 cm. C: h. 12.7 cm; w. 12.1 cm. Th. 0.7 cm. The three
                    disjoint fragments are from one side of a white-ground calyx-krater, black
                    inside. In good condition but for some slight scratches, abrasions, and mineral
                    deposits; flakes on B take away part of Eros's legs, and Aphrodite's right hand
                    and left elbow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The confrontation of
                    Helen and Paris. A: Helen. B: Aphrodite and Eros. C: Paris, of whom only part of
                    his cloak remains, and Aeneas. There remain the head, shoulders, breast and left
                    hand of Helen, facing right, her name inscribed above her. She wears a chiton
                    and holds her himation over her left shoulder, her hair tied up in a broad band
                    with three leaves projecting at the front. She was shown standing, her hand
                    bowed in acquiescence to Aphrodite, who sends off a little Eros toward her.
                    Parts of the inscriptions identifying them remain above Aphrodite's head. With
                    her left hand either she gestures to Paris or lifts her cloak. It has been shown
                    that she was seated. A broad band embroidered with rosettes and decorated with
                    three projections or leaves in front is bound around the sakkos in which her
                    hair is gathered, a fringe of hair protruding at the back. She wears a himation
                    across her body over a chiton. Eros's legs and wing-tips are preserved; he may
                    have been holding a wreath, to which the small loop below him and at left of
                    Aphrodite's hand would have belonged. Behind Aphrodite stood Paris, a bit of
                    whose cloak is preserved, and next to him his companion, Aeneas, who is almost
                    wholly preserved. He stands frontal, his head turned toward the fateful scene.
                    He wears a petasos and a bordered chlamys, and holds two javelins upright in his
                    right hand. His lower legs and feet, his right hand, the top of his hat are
                    missing. At the right there remains a bit of the floral which must have
                    decorated the handle-zone of the vase.</p>
                <p>Helen's head-band is purple, her himation a golden-brown; Aphrodite's
                    sakkos and himation are purple, her head-band golden-brown, the rosettes
                    decorating it done in white with purple dots at the centers; Paris's cloak was
                    purple; Aeneas' petasos is golden brown, the chlamys golden brown with a purple
                    border; the petasos is tied with a purple cord and attached to the chlamys with
                    a purple-dotted clip. The outlines and inner lines of faces, bodies, and
                    chitons, the hairs, Eros's wings, the inscriptions, the javelins, the floral,
                    are done in black or dilute glaze.</p>

                    <foreign xml:lang="greek">[epig-rough]*E*L*E*N</foreign>, over her

                    over the head of Aphrodite.</p>
                <p>These three fragments tell us a great deal. The black glaze on the
                    inside indicates an open vessel, the size indicates that it was a large open
                    vessel such as a krater, the curvature indicates a calyx-krater. A calyx-krater
                    covered with a white ground and decorated in color indicates that the vase was
                    probably prized by the owner, for the type is rare.</p>
                <p>The white-ground technique was not foreign to the artists with whom
                    the painter of the Cincinnati fragments worked: the Villa Giulia Painter
                    decorated white-ground lekythoi and alabastra, and fragments of two white-ground
                    calyx-kraters by him are known. Fragments of a volute-krater which show that the
                    decoration of the neck was done on a white ground have been attributed to the
                    Methyse Painter, who belonged to the group of the Villa Giulia Painter, and who
                    probably painted the krater to which the Cincinnati fragments belonged (see
                        <bibl>Mertens 1977</bibl>. The Methyse Painter
                    is named for a maenad on a krater in New York (<bibl
                        >ARV2, 632, no. 3</bibl>; compare the Terpaulos Painter, <rs type="vase"
                       >St. Louis WU 3283</rs>, named for a satyr). His work, of which
                    less than twenty samples have been identified, is akin to that of the Chicago
                    Painter (<rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.22</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >St. Louis 15.1951</rs>), and shows quiet scenes where women
                    predominate.</p>
                <p>Often, and perversely, chance has left only the lower parts of
                    figures, but good fortune has given us the heads of the figures here and even
                    the inscriptions naming them. Paris's meeting with Helen is the sequel to the
                    Judgement of Paris, which follows upon the mischief of Discord at the wedding of
                    Peleus and Thetis. These events are recorded in the poems of the <hi rend="ital"
                       >Cypria,</hi> part of the epic cycle of verse which included the
                    Homeric epics and which was known to fifth century authors and artists, and to
                    the public. L. Ghali-Kahil, in her study of the abduction and return of Helen in
                    art and in the literature <bibl>Ghali-Kahil 1955,
                        69f.</bibl>), directs attention to the theme of beauty which is becoming
                    dominant at this period. The artist from now on prefers the moment when Helen
                    and Paris, accompanied by Aphrodite and Eros, first set eyes on each other
                    (notice how Helen, on the Cincinnati fragment, lowers her head but looks up from
                    under her lashes). The preceding period preferred the moment when Paris led
                    Helen away, as depicted on the famous Boston skyphos by Makron (<bibl
                       >ARV2, 458, no. 1</bibl>). Ghali-Kahil notes the
                    contrast in type between the scenes showing the abduction of Helen and those of
                    pursuit or rape which were popular in contemporary art: Helen went willingly.
                    The Cincinnati fragments stand nearer the genre scenes of women preparing for a
                    wedding or receiving the visit of a gentleman which become prevalent in the
                    second half of the fifth century (<bibl>Ghali-Kahil
                        1955, 69f.</bibl>).</p>

                    Chicago; given by Professor F.B. Tarbell (1967.115.60, formerly UC 296). From
                    Athens. Given to Professor Tarbell by Mr. E.P. Warren, who bought it from
                    Hartwig.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. diam. 5.3 cm; th.
                    0.8 to 0.9 cm. The fragment is quite thick and flat, but it was turned on the
                    wheel; shiny black glaze inside and out, with some scratches and chips.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> There remain head,
                    shoulders, and right side of a warrior leaning forward. He wears a chlamys
                    buckled at the neck with a large round black-centered brooch and thrown back at
                    the right to expose a prominent nipple and ribs done in relief line. On his head
                    is an elaborate Thracian helmet, the crest, cheekpiece, and rim reserved, a
                    reserved floral decoration spiraling up the side of the black headcover. His
                    long wavy hair escaping from under the helmet, and the fringe of his beard
                    showing under the cheek-piece are done in thin glaze. At the left is part of an
                    upraised arm and hand, not his, and at the right, part of an unexplained object
                    or figure. The broad preliminary outline is visible. There is relief outline
                    everywhere; the relief line is quite thick in places, as ribs, nose, lips, which
                    tends to give the figure a particularly fierce look. No sketch lines are
                    visible.</p>
                <p>Beazley suggested that this piece might be from a lekanis (<bibl
                       >ARV2, infra</bibl>). Certainly the low
                    curvature, the good glaze inside, and the thickness indicate a lekanis lid. It
                    would have been a fairly big one. The Niobid Painter specialized in very large
                    vases, but there is one certain lekanis lid attributed to him, with a Peleus and
                    Thetis scene (<rs type="vase">Naples 2638</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 607, no. 89</bibl>). It counts among a handful of
                    earlier lekanides with figured decoration; most extant ones were made later in
                    the century, and those mostly show scenes appropriate to women (see <rs
                        type="vase">University of Chicago 1967.115.59</rs>). It is
                    interesting that of the few earlier pieces, one is by the Berlin Painter, three
                    by artists akin in spirit to his pupil, the Achilles Painter, one by another
                    pupil, Hermonax. This last, a fragmentary lid, <rs type="vase"
                        >Ferrara, inv. 3095</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 490, no.
                        125</bibl>) has a warrior scene, a battle of gods and giants, and it is
                    large (49.5 cm in diameter). There is another lekanis, a small one, in
                    Leningrad, with a battle of Greeks and Amazons, which Beazley dated to 440-430
                        (<rs type="vase">St. Petersburg B 4357</rs>, <bibl
                       >A. A. Peredolskaya, <title>Krasnofigurnye

                <p>The Niobid Painter liked warriors. One of his early pieces, a
                    volute-krater, (<rs type="vase">Palermo G 1283</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 599, no. 2</bibl>), has a battle of Greeks
                    and Amazons on the body. We can compare details of drawing on the Chicago
                    warrior with this: contrast of dark and light, shape of helmet, tendril
                    decorating head-piece, shape of cheek-piece with fringe of beard showing below
                    it, wavy hair escaping below neck-piece, profiles of nose and mouth, rendering
                    of eye, ribs and nipple. Treatment of eye and ribs indicates an early date. The
                    long upper lip, the profile of the lips, as though pushed forward, the heavy
                    relief line everywhere, even for inner markings, are characteristic. For late
                    work by the painter, see <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                        1967.115.410</rs>, and for a work in his manner, with characteristic subject

                <p>Greek vase-painting is almost all we have left of Greek painting, and
                    the Niobid Painter's work has been seen to reflect famous paintings which we
                    know only from the literature ‚Äî not the fragments we show, nor the
                    complete vases they come from, nor the bell-krater in his manner. The Niobid
                    Painter's chefs-d'oeuvre are large vases, volute and calyx-kraters, none in the
                    midwest. Neither the pictures nor the drawing are great, but they echo great
                    innovations ‚Äî placement of figures, postures, expression, the choice of
                    the quiet moment before or after action ‚Äî details considered worthy of
                    comment in antiquity. One such is the picture of heroes standing and seated
                    about Athena and Herakles, on the vase in the Louvre whose reverse picture, the
                    slaughter of the sons and daughters of Niobe, gives the painter his name (<rs
                        type="vase">Louvre G 341</rs>, <bibl
                       >ARV2, 601, no. 22</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The nature of the new art made it unsuitable for the decoration of
                    the finite, curved surfaces of a pot, and the vase-paintings which give us an
                    idea of it are not successful. Vase-painting was to lose its vigor as it lost
                    its youth, and as its purpose, decoration, diverged from that of wall-painting.
                    The Niobid Painter's is one of several directions which vase-painting took in
                    the middle of the fifth century. The Chicago Painter and the Achilles Painter
                    (cf. <rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.22</rs> and <rs type="vase"
                       >St. Louis 15.1951</rs>) represent two other prominent paths in
                    the art of the time.</p>

                    and around her head a broad fillet over a diadem with two upstanding leaves. The
                    fillet is done in yellow paint over white. Raised dots of black indicate curls
                    about her face; thin glaze was used for the long curly strands of hair down her
                    back and over her shoulder; thin glaze for the neck muscle. Relief outline is
                    used everywhere, even for outline of head within the usual reserved outline, and
                    for her back under the long hair. A sketch mark is visible along the line of her
                    throat. Part of the pomegranate-net bordering the picture on the left side
                    remains, and a small part of the reserved line from the upper border.</p>
                <p>The strong double curvature supports Beazley's conjecture that the
                    fragment might be from an oinochoe of shape 3, called <hi rend="ital"
                       >chous</hi> in antiquity: a low handle attached to a trefoil
                    mouth and bulbous body which meet in an unbroken curve from lip to low foot.
                    Black-figure oinochoai of various types have pictures framed at the sides with
                    pomegranate-net design or its degenerate, a double row of dots. A number of
                    red-figure oinochoai of Shape 1 have that border pattern (all are by painters of
                    column kraters, for which it is a normal side border), and it even appears a few
                    times on choes, but it does not belong to the red-figure shape. The number of
                    red-figure choes by recognized painters from the first half of the century is
                    small and even the five certain choes attributed to the Niobid Painter are an
                    unusual number for one artist. Two of those have unframed pictures; the others
                    have a side border normal for framed pictures on red-figure choes, a simple
                    reserved line. Often in Attic vase-painting a person is meant to be singing when
                    he is represented with his head flung back (cf. <bibl
                       >Bieber in <title>AJA</title> 45 [1941]
                    529</bibl>); just so, the lady here is probably singing and might have been
                    holding a lyre since her arm was stretched forward. She is not seated: the
                    reserved area at her back which might be taken for the back of a <hi rend="ital"
                       >klismos</hi> (cf. the chair on the obverse of <rs type="vase"
                       >Chicago 1922.2197</rs>) is not outlined and was surely only
                    intended to set off her hair. There would have been at most one other figure
                    ‚Äî the vase is small and the Niobid Painter leaves space between his
                    figures on his less grandiose vases. For the line at neck, the ear, and the eye
                    on this fragment compare similar, although larger scale, details on the
                    painter's name-piece, also late, the famous calyx-krater, <rs type="vase"

                <p>The Art Institute of Chicago; gift of Martin A. Ryerson (1922.2197).
                    Found at Capua; formerly in the van Branteghem Collection; purchased by Mr.
                    Ryerson in Paris, 1892, at the van Branteghem sale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 38.4 cm; d. of mouth
                    inside 37.9 cm; d. of rim 41.2 cm; d. of foot outside 19.8 cm. Intact, except
                    for the handle right of Side B, which was apparently broken off and repaired.
                    Some parts patched with plaster and painted over, especially the area around
                    that handle, including a great part of tendril and lotusbud at left, the upper
                    part of the palmette under that handle, and parts of tongue decoration around
                    both roots. The outline of the shield on Side B is shaky and looks restored, but
                    I think it is original. Lip scratched and abraded; numerous scratches and
                    abrasions on outside, especially lower front; some pitting inside vase and much
                    on the bottom inside. Glaze fired greenish in places, as on the lip and around
                    the figures. Good glaze inside. A red wash over the reserved areas varies in
                    intensity, giving sometimes a pink, sometimes an orange effect. Below the
                    meander border under the woman at left, on the obverse, a decorative border of
                    some kind was started and painted over, visible under ultra-violet light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Dark and light,
                    straight and curved, vertical and horizontal are combined restfully on the solid
                    shape. The vertical elements of the main composition, on the obverse, frame a
                    central scene which the horizontal libation dish and branch focus onto the black
                    and reserved circles of the frontal shield; the verticals are balanced by the
                    horizontals of the high-set picture and the decorative borders above and below
                    it encircling the vase. Torus-shaped lip, outsides of handles, lower body, upper
                    surface of foot are black. The whole rests solidly on the broad disk foot,
                    reserved on side and underside. Thinned glazed is used extensively on this pot,
                    even taking the place of the usual red bands painted at various points around a
                    vase: a very narrow line, reserved and apparently covered with thinned glaze,
                    encircles the outer edge of the top surface of the foot.</p>
                <p>The inside of the vase is black, with a reserved band about the top
                    and one 4.9 cm below it, corresponding to the lower edge of the "collar"
                    outside; both bands are lined in thinned glaze. Below a reserved band at
                    juncture with lip, the collar is decorated with a wreath of laurel to left,
                    outlined in thinned glaze; the spines of the leaves are done in thin brown
                    lines. The offset at juncture of collar and body is left reserved above the
                    pictures, painted black over the handles. The handles are reserved inside, with
                    a curved strip reserved on the vase inside the handle-roots. A band of tongue
                    decoration encircles each root. Below each handle are two palmettes, one
                    directed up, one down, the middle leaf of each spined. From the spirals joining
                    the palmettes, tendrils emanate to frame the handle-roots, giving off two sets
                    of palmette leaves and spirals, and continuing up to bound, with an upright bud,
                    the handle-zones on each side; at left on the obverse there was no room. A band
                    of meander and saltire-square borders the pictures below: two stopped meanders
                    to right alternating with a black-filled saltire-square; at left of B and under
                    handle right of B just below lotus there are three meander squares instead of
                    two. The join of body and foot is marked by a tooled groove.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Side A:</hi> A young warrior sits to
                    right, a staff held upright in his left hand, in his right a large libation dish
                    decorated with gadroons. He wears a Corinthian helmet pushed up to show his
                    face, and a himation over a chitoniskos embroidered with dots in groups of three
                    and bordered at the arm with a dotted band. The chair (<hi rend="ital"
                       >klismos</hi>) on which he sits is set in front of a Doric
                    column, to the right of which a pair of greaves is set on a high shelf: the
                    scene takes place in or at a building of some sort. On the column, the
                    architectural elements of capital and epistyle are necessarily telescoped.
                    Behind the chair a woman stands to right, dressed in the unbound Doric peplos,
                    folds of which fall over the meander border. Her hair is tied up with an
                    embroidered band; relief lines indicate separate strands over the black mass of
                    hair at her cheek. A triangular drop earring hangs from her ear. She holds up an
                    embroidered taenia with both hands. Before the chair stands another woman,
                    frontal, ready to pour a libation from the oinochoe in her right hand, her left
                    balancing a shield upright before her (it appears to be resting on her very
                    large toes). The oinochoe is decorated with a band of dots around the shoulder.
                    The shield is black with rim reserved, a reserved wreath for blazon. The rim is
                    bounded by concentric compass-drawn circles, the center marked by a pit in the
                    clay, the grooves of the compass evident. The woman wears chiton and
                    dark-bordered himation, a disk earring with a dot in the center, a dotted or
                    studded band about her hair set with three upright leaves. In back of her,
                    facing the seated youth, stands an old man, a trefoil-topped barberpole scepter
                    planted upright with his right hand, a leaved branch in his left. He wears
                    chiton and a black-edged himation, draped in such a way as to form a sleeve over
                    the left arm. His hair is left reserved; the intention may have been to paint
                    over it in white, but no trace of paint remains. The extension of the
                    preliminary outline of the nose, no doubt mistaken, and the sloppy outline of
                    the back of neck caused the odd configuration of his hair. Relief outline is
                    used almost everywhere, even bordering, both inside and out, the reserved
                    outlines of the heads of both women; it is lacking at the drapery over the back
                    of the woman at left. Thinned glaze is used extensively, for details such as
                    strands of hair, shading of the eye of the helmet and the triangular spaces
                    where the peplos is clipped at shoulders, borders of garments, pleat lines,
                    earrings, embroidery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Side B:</hi> In the center, a young man
                    dressed in himation, short bushy hair encircled by a wreath, stands to left,
                    holding a shield and spear in front of him with his left hand, a Thracian helmet
                    in his outstretched right. The wreath was done in added paint, traces of which
                    remain. A leaping dolphin in black, thinning in places to brown, decorates the
                    helmet. In the center of the reserved shield is a black lion's head to left, its
                    long tongue sticking out; mane and tongue are done in thinned glaze. Large black
                    studs encircle the shield rim between the compass-made circles which bound it,
                    the outer circle done in relief line, the inner indicated only by tool-marks;
                    the mark made by the compass at center is visible. At left a woman stands facing
                    the youth, both hands outstretched as if to receive the armor. She wears chiton
                    and himation, and in her hair a studded, pronged tiara. At left stands another
                    woman, right arm outstretched so that her hand is partly obscured by the shield.
                    She wears chiton and dark bordered himation draped so that it forms a sort of
                    sleeve over her left arm and hand. Her hair is gathered up at her neck and tied
                    around with a band. Hands, feet and even heads on this side are large and
                    clumsy. Thinned glaze is used for profiles of heads and for details of features
                    excepting eyes and nostrils of the women, which are done in relief. The young
                    man's eyebrow, eye, pupil and nostril are brown. No relief outline except for
                    segments of the shield rim, parts of the helmet, and for the long shaft of the
                    spear.</p>
                <p>Broad preliminary outlines are everywhere visible. Except for the
                    heads of figures on the reverse, sketch marks are visible for most parts of the
                    drawing, including parts of the floral; especially clear where one object or
                    figure overlaps another, as limbs under clothes, staff behind shield, column
                    behind chair. The only change is a slight variation of the position of the
                    shield on B with respect to the sketch.</p>
                <p>The bell-krater, named for its shape, is a latecomer to Attic
                    vase-painting. It derives from the vintage vat, as the one shown on the cup 87,
                    and the Berlin Painter has been credited with introducing it. Four from his hand
                    are known, and two from his contemporary, the Kleophrades Painter, but there is
                    also a fragment of one in the Villa Giulia by the Hischylos Painter, a decorator
                    of early cups (<bibl>ARV2, 162, below, no.
                    5</bibl>). One or two show up thereafter, but the bell-krater is not found in
                    large numbers until the time of the Niobid and the Villa Giulia Painters and
                    their groups (there is a bell-krater in Madison showing Theseus pursuing Helen,
                    by a follower of the Niobid Painter, <rs type="vase">Madison
                        69.31.1</rs>). Then it enjoys a certain favor during the last half of the
                    fifth century and in fourth-century South Italy (the shape is often called
                    "Campanian"). See <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                        1967.115.244</rs> for a fragment of one by the Peleus Painter.</p>
                <p>Beazley described the obverse picture both as "warrior at home"
                        (<bibl>ARV2, infra</bibl>) and "libation before
                    departure" (<bibl>Caskey &amp; Beazley, ii,
                    78</bibl>). The question is, I suppose, when does a warrior perform a libation
                    sitting down? There are numerous representations of seated divinities holding
                    out libation dishes, and there are libation scenes similar to this where one
                    person is seated (complete with column in background), but generally in these
                    the libation dish and oinochoe both are carried by other standing figures. Erika
                    Simon (<hi rend="ital">infra</hi>) has observed that departing
                    warriors always are shown standing, that our seated figure is probably a god or
                    hero, possibly Achilles, with his mother, the Nereid Thetis, standing before
                    him, the sea-god Nereus behind her, and another Nereid behind Achilles. The
                    scene on the reverse may, but need not be, intimately connected. Some of the
                    many departure scenes by the Niobid Painter and his followers show a related
                    scene on the reverse and some do not.</p>
                <p>The subject matter and its handling, the actors, the clothing and
                    appurtenances, the apparatus of libation, the Doric column and the <hi
                        rend="ital">klismos,</hi> the barber-pole staff and its finial,
                    the branch, the rendering of detail, the use of laurel and meander with
                    saltire-square for borders are all to be found in work by the Niobid Painter,
                    and were cited by Rich (<hi rend="ital">infra,</hi>) in attributing
                    the vase to him. In Beazley's lists however, it is numbered with works in the
                    painter's manner; a note in the first edition of <hi rend="ital"
                        >ARV</hi> (<hi rend="ital">infra</hi>) perhaps explains why:
                    "recalls the Painter of the Woolly Satyrs" (a follower of the Niobid Painter).
                    Indeed, a number of details in the drawing on our vase can be found, though
                    elaborated, on a volute-krater by that painter, <rs type="vase">New
                        York 07.286.84</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 613, no.
                    1</bibl>): the use of thinned glaze, reserved wreath on the dark shield, the
                    extension of the picture into the meander border, the form of the border itself,
                    the old man with hair unpainted, and, on the seated youth the line of lip
                    closure, the line of chin and neck, the dotted band bordering the arm of his
                    garment and the rendering of the wavy fringe of hair about his face. The
                    extensive use of dilute glaze, even for parts of the drawing which had once been
                    done in black, is noteworthy. Contrast this use of brown with the Niobid
                    Painter's own liking for the heavy black relief line (cf.<rs type="vase"
                       >University of Chicago 1967.115.60</rs>). Relief outlining the
                    inside of the reserved hairline, and relief lines over black ground for strands
                    of hair are found often in the Niobid Painter's work. For a similar disposition
                    of the picture, high and with the effect of a horizontal band, with vertical
                    emphasis in the composition, cf. a bell-krater by the Niobid Painter in Perugia
                        (<bibl>ARV2, 603, no. 34</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The floral is characteristic of the Niobid Painter and his group,
                    especially the motif of three petals set in the angle of spiral and tendril (see
                        <bibl>Jacobsthal 1927, 162</bibl>, and <bibl
                       >Caskey &amp; Beazley, ii, 72</bibl>). The
                    "Niobidean" floral forms a link between the vases of the Niobid Group and others
                    whose figure work is of different style (cf. <bibl

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; given by Professor F.B. Tarbell (1967.115.390, formerly UC 294). Ex
                    Hartwig Collection; ex Warren Collection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. dim. 14.4 cm; th.
                    0.7 cm below to 0.5 cm above. The light orange clay has been given a deeper
                    color through the use of red wash. The inner side of the fragment is black
                    glazed with a reserved line, perhaps painted over with red, at the join of neck
                    and body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The painted scenes are
                    in two registers, separated by a band of the tongue-pattern. <hi rend="ital"
                       >Above:</hi> a nude armed man, Kaineus, helmeted, with a lance
                    in his right hand and a sheathed sword slung over his left side holds aloft a
                    shield over his left arm (a portion of the lower edge of the shield, seen from
                    the inside, is visible). His form is cut off at mid-thigh by the decorative
                    band. At left, what appears to be the front legs of a horse belong to a centaur;
                    above the legs, a portion of the tree with four curving branches with which the
                    centaur is attacking Kaineus. <hi rend="ital">Below:</hi> a young
                    man moves toward the left, looking back, wearing a short, bordered chlamys and a
                    petasos slung over his shoulder, and holding two spears in his left hand (not
                    preserved in the fragment); he extends his right arm toward the figure at left,
                    of which all that remains is the hand holding the phiale.</p>
                <p>Relief contour is used more fully in the upper register than in the
                    lower; above, it is used generally, except for the contours of the horsey legs
                    and small portions of the pommel and hilt of the sword. In the lower register,
                    relief contour is used only for the shafts of the spears, thigh of the figure,
                    and portions of the phiale. Dilute glaze is used to depict the thinning edges of
                    hair such as that straggling out from under the neck-guard of Kaineus, and
                    elsewhere to pick out details of anatomy, as in the ribs of Kaineus' abdomen.
                    Preliminary sketch lines are visible in several places.</p>
                <p>The subject of Kaineus refers to one of the many battles in Greek
                    mythology between centaurs, part human-part horse, and Greeks. Kaineus, a Greek
                    of the Lapith tribe, was invulnerable, so the centaurs resorted to hammering him
                    into the ground with stones and, as seen in this fragment, with the trunks of
                    trees. As in all centauromachies, the battle between Greek men and animalistic
                    centaurs expresses the concern, central in Greek thought, with the struggle
                    between civilization and barbarism, and chaos in the universe. On our fragment,
                    the contrast between the wrought weaponry of Kaineus and the unworked tree,
                    weapon of the centaurs, expresses an aspect of this struggle, just as does the
                    contrast between the human form of Kaineus and the hybrid form of the centaur.
                    The subject of the Battle of Kaineus has a long heritage in Attic vase-painting,
                    going back to the Fran√ßois Vase of the early sixth century B.C., where it
                    is illustrated on the reverse side of the neck; in this early example, Kaineus
                    is seen attacked by three centaurs as he disappears into the earth. Most later
                    representations show Kaineus attacked by only two centaurs, as was probably the
                    case in our fragment.</p>
                <p>Although calyx-kraters were made in Athens in the Archaic period (a
                    black-figure example in this exhibition, <rs type="vase">Toledo
                        1963.26</rs>, is attributed to the Rycroft Painter, those with two registers
                    do not appear until the second half of the fifth century. Since this is a period
                    in which the trend toward scenic naturalism is strong, Jacobsthal suggested that
                    the appearance of the two-register decoration was a conservative reaction, an
                    attempt to counter, by means of the anti-illusionistic register system,
                    naturalistic and illusionistic effects of depth which might disturb the
                    decorative surface of the vase. It is interesting, therefore, that in some
                    calyx-kraters with two registers, the artist seems to exploit the decorative
                    band separating the registers as a sort of illusionistic conceit suggesting the
                    surface of the earth, as in scenes showing the appearance of a figure from
                    underground, such as the Birth of Pandora or the Rising of Kore; in our vase
                    fragment, the disappearance of Kaineus below the earth is expressed by parallel
                    means.</p>
                <p>As is common in calyx-kraters with two friezes, the artist has
                    expended greater attention to the upper register, which has the advantage of not
                    being interrupted by handles, than to the lower; the story of Kaineus is more
                    unusual and more intrinsically fascinating than is the routine departure of a
                    youth that seems to be taking place below, and the greater use of relief contour
                    and dilute glaze in the upper scene also points to greater concentration on the
                    part of the artist to that portion of the decoration. Sometimes, the lower and
                    upper registers are thematically connected, but there is no evidence that this
                    is the case here.</p>
                <p>In sum, this is a fragment of a large vase by a member of a major
                    group of artists of the High Classical period, which features Kaineus, a unique
                    victim in the important series of mythological battles between Greeks and
                    centaurs.</p>

                    0.8 cm below to 0.5 cm above. Three pieces joined. Some abrasion and chipping,
                    particularly along the broken edges; surface chipped above the lower edge of the
                    uppermost of the three joined fragments, left side. Interior: dull black glaze.
                    Color of clay heightened by use of a red wash. For an example of a complete
                    bell-krater, slightly earlier in the fifth century, see <rs type="vase"
                       >Chicago 1922.2197</rs>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> Two youths, the one at
                    right seated on an altar, his head turned as he looks over his shoulder, the
                    other standing in an easy posture, his hand resting on his hip, a spear in his
                    left hand. The seated figure wears a petasos and chlamys and high-laced sandals,
                    and holds two spears and a sheathed sword pressed to his chest by his left arm.
                    The standing figure wears a chlamys with a broad black border, and high laced
                    sandals, and holds two spears. At left, lower portion of handle palmette.
                    Beneath the figured portions, a decorative frieze of meanders running from right
                    to left, separated by checkered squares. Relief contour line except for portions
                    of drapery, shoes, and palmette. Preliminary sketch lines visible. Added white
                    or yellow for neck strap of petasos.</p>
                <p>The scene of two youthful travelers resting at an altar suggests a
                    narrative and, as Franklin Johnson (who attributed the work to the Kadmos
                    Painter) pointed out, it may represent Orestes and Pylades at the altar in
                    Tauris upon which foreigners were slain. The episode is known from Euripides'
                        <hi rend="ital">Iphigeneia in Tauris</hi> (<bibl n="Eur. IT"
                       >Eur. IT</bibl>) and although stylistic
                    considerations preclude placing this vase as late as 413 B.C., to which year
                    Euripides' play probably dates, the story of Iphigeneia, Orestes and Pylades was
                    related in earlier dramas. The scene at the altar, as written by Euripides, is
                    marked by a mood of wariness, and indeed, on the vase fragment, the posture of
                    the seated youth is a study of unease. In the classical period, the physical
                    tension inherent in the posture of sitting with raised knee grasped in linked
                    hands is used as a visual analogy for psychological tension and conflict. The
                    best known example of this, in sculpture, is perhaps in the figure of Ares on
                    the east frieze of the Parthenon. In vase-painting, on the vase by the Niobid
                    Painter in the Louvre, it is in the figure of Peirithoos, unwillingly forced to
                    remain in the underworld as his companion, Theseus, rises to depart. (For this
                    interpretation see <bibl>E. Simon, "Polygnotan
                        Painting and the Niobid Painter," <title>AJA</title> 67
                        [1963] 43-54</bibl>.) To the posture of the hands around the knee, the
                    artist of the Chicago fragment adds the tension of the strong twist of the head
                    as the youth turns to peer over his shoulder (Euripides <hi rend="ital"

                <p>Psychological subtlety is united in this fragment with a delicacy of
                    execution that can be seen particularly in the face of the seated youth. His
                    eye, naturalistically rendered in profile view, and the elongated brow above it,
                    combine with the fullness of the mouth to convey a sweetness and a mood of
                    melancholy. Arms and legs are drawn with light but canny contour-lines. Curly
                    hair, painted in dilute glaze, trails down the youth's neck. These qualities of
                    psychological subtlety, naturalism in the rendering of posture and physical
                    traits, as well as the restrained but unmistakable expression of intimacy
                    between the figures, are characteristic of vase painting, as of other artistic
                    media, in the later fifth century B.C., This is particularly true of the
                    Peleus-Hector Group of the larger Group of Polygnotos, the major red-figure
                    workshop of the High Classical period.</p>
                <p>Beazley attributed the fragment to the Peleus Painter; traits of the
                    drawing most suggestive of the style of this artist are the delicacy of the face
                    and the fleshy upper body of the seated youth. The head is related to that of
                    the sweet-faced victor on the Peleus Painter's pelike, <rs type="vase"
                       >Taranto 52368</rs>, and the fleshy chest to that of Mousaios on
                    the artist's well known neck-amphora in the British Museum (<rs type="vase"
                       >London E 271</rs>). However, the petasos of the seated youth is
                    perched unstably on top of his head, in contrast to other examples attributed to
                    the Peleus Painter where the petasos rests solidly on the crown, and the
                    symmetrical, pointed dip on the side of the petasos is also without parallel on
                    other works attributed to this artist. The hooks that describe the folds of the
                    chlamys on the standing figure are too compressed to convey the impression of
                    the easy fall of material as the Peleus Painter regularly represents it, and the
                    spiral shape of the weight at the hem's corner contrasts with the simple loop
                    with which the Peleus Painter represents this device. Five and six sandal straps
                    encircle the legs of the youths on the Chicago fragment, while the Peleus
                    Painter renders the sandal with twice as many straps, each finer than those
                    drawn here. The Peleus Painter also includes the tie at the top of the thongs,
                    omitted in the Chicago fragment, and the thick soles and loops formed by the
                    pull of the straps across the instep contrast with the patterns of straight
                    crossing lines drawn by the Peleus Painter, who renders a different style of
                    sandal, one with a leather plaque over the instep, as on the judge of the
                    artist's calyx-krater fragment, <rs type="vase">Ferrara T 404</rs>,
                    and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Meanders running left occur occasionally in the Group of Polygnotos,
                    but in no other vase attributed to the Peleus Painter. The density of these
                    meanders is in contrast to the more open form used by the Peleus Painter, and
                    the presence of checker-squares, infrequent in the Polygnotan circle, is
                    otherwise unknown in work attributed to the Peleus Painter.</p>

                <p>Lent by The David and Alfred Smart Gallery, The University of
                    Chicago; given by Professor F. B. Tarbell (1967.115.168, formerly UC 291). Ex
                    Warren collection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. dim 7.6 cm; th. 0.4
                    cm below to 0.75 cm above. From the shoulder of a large closed vase. Interior of
                    fragment, very light orange clay. The surface of the fragment is in good
                    condition, with some chipping and abrasion, particularly near the lower edge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The fragment preserves
                    the head, chest, upper right arm and back, and a portion of the right arm of a
                    woman, facing left, her head bent forward. She wears a peplos and earrings, and
                    has her hair caught up in a turban-like sphendone from which rays, now faded in
                    color but originally rendered in added white or yellow, form a diadem. At left,
                    a portion of the hand and hair over the forehead of another figure. At right,
                    part of the edge of what was probably an architectural element. Relief contour
                    used except for reserved outlines of hair and for the hand of the figure at
                    left. Dilute glaze used for the edges of curls around the face, and for the
                    circlet of the earring.</p>
                <p>The straight-edged form at right probably represents an element of
                    architecture, toward which the two figures address themselves. Since there are
                    no signs of fluting, it is probably not a column, but may represent a stele,
                    either funereal or commemorative, although there are other possibilities (a door
                    frame or the outer wall of a naiskos, for example). If it is a stele, there are
                    no indications of a fillet tied around to help identify it as a funeral
                    monument, although such a ribbon may have been rendered in added color, now
                    lost. We would expect to see some traces remaining however, since indications of
                    the diadem, in added color, can still be seen. The woman, full-bodied in
                    stature, introspective in mood, and holding forth her garment in a wifely
                    gesture, recalls representations of women bidding farewell to their husbands in
                    scenes of warrior departure by the Kleophon Painter, as on the well-known
                    stamnos in Munich. The head of the woman on the fragment is bent more deeply (50
                    degrees) than the modestly tilted heads of women saying good-by to their
                    husbands (the 30-degree bend of the head of the woman on the Munich vase is
                    characteristic), suggesting that the woman on the fragment, with her attention
                    focused at or near the base of the architectural element, is not bidding
                    farewell, but may be involved in a scene of sacrifice with a low altar, or in
                    one representing the offering of funerary gifts.</p>
                <p>Whether the theme of the vase was sacrificial, funereal, or of some
                    other subject, the woman represented is a fine example of the High Classical
                    conception of the human figure. Naturalistic yet idealized, monumental yet
                    intimate, and drawn with a fluid grace, she represents a reflection in the
                    medium of vase-painting of the kind of figure one finds in stately procession on
                    the frieze of the Parthenon, completed a few years before this fragment was
                    probably painted. The naturalism can be seen in the effective suggestion of the
                    three-dimensional quality of her body, as well as in details such as the
                    representation of the profile eye in a triangular shape, in contrast to the
                    almond-shaped "frontal" eye in profile heads of the Archaic period. Like other
                    artists of the High Classical period, the painter of this fragment suggests the
                    existence of inner life, as well as traits of surface naturalism, and does so by
                    rendering a thoughtful, and thus, thought-provoking, facial expression. For the
                    High Classical artist, the conception of what is real about human beings
                    included a psychological dimension, in which we see an early phase of the
                    psychological penetration that was later to become so important in Greek art.</p>
                <p>The Kleophon Painter, a red-figure artist who issued from the Group
                    of Polygnotos (see <rs type="vase">University of Chicago
                        1967.115.244</rs>), is often considered representative in vase-painting of
                    the High Classical form and spirit, exemplified by the Pheidian sculptures of
                    the Parthenon. A resemblance between the woman on our fragment and figures by
                    the Kleophon Painter, led Franklin Johnson, although he noted discrepancies, to
                    attribute the fragment to this important artist, an attribution with which J. D.
                    Beazley did not concur. Because of certain stylistic features, the use of a
                    check-fold on the back, differences in the rendering of the ears and earring
                    from examples by the Kleophon Painter (the horizontal lines with which the
                    Kleophon Painter represents the inner portion of the ear are not visible in the
                    fragment), it is appropriate to separate this fragment from the oeuvre of the
                    Kleophon Painter. In a larger sense, the facial expression of the woman on the
                    fragment does not have the psychological depth of comparable figures by the
                    Kleophon Painter, and the drawing of the figure, particularly the breasts, is
                    less accurate than we would expect in works by this artist. One can assume,
                    however, that the painter of this fragment had works by the Kleophon Painter in
                    mind when he set out to paint this vase.</p>
                <p>In sum, this is a fragment of a scene, perhaps of funerary or
                    sacrificial significance, of the High Classical period, which recalls the
                    Kleophon Painter in style, and like the work of that artist, exemplifies the
                    High Classical conception of human form.</p>

                    inscription, scratched before firing (fig. 1).</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The edge of the knob is
                    flanged and reserved; radiating from the base of the handle are rays. Just under
                    the handles, running around the vase, are two fine lines in applied red. Handle
                    zone is reserved band with vertical zigzags; reservation in panel underneath
                    handles and on inside of handles as well. There is a vertical lug on each side
                    of the handle which could indicate a metal prototype for the shape. The black
                    glaze is lustrous with a certain greenish tone. On the standing ring: <foreign
                        xml:lang="greek">*S*T*A*I*T*E *N*I*E*O*N*E*K*A*L</foreign>.
                    The whole resting surface, besides being worn and scratched around a narrow band
                    in the center, is covered with a shallow scratches, many of which look
                    intentional; the effect is one of a series of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*X</foreign>'s, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >*A</foreign>'s and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*G</foreign>'s. The
                    inscription on the standing ring is worn, faint and very difficult to read. The
                    first three letters are clear; between the alpha and the second tau there is a
                    short vertical mark which may have been intentional, resembling an iota, but is
                    very small. The second tau is clear. This is followed by an epsilon, the upper
                    horizontal and the middle bar are not easily seen. There is a large crack at
                    this point and the next letter is messy but seems to be a nu with a faint line
                    (scratch) running through it. The alpha is strong and the next I take to be an
                    iota, though there are two very light accidental scratches near the top (a
                    digamma seems unlikely). A good epsilon follows, then an omicron which is
                    slightly open top and bottom; the nu is clear. There is an epsilon with the
                    bottom horizontal worn. The last three are doubtless <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*K*A*L</foreign>.</p>
                <p>In 1967, Mr. E. H. Williams left on file some notes concerning the
                    inscription; Alan W. Johnston and Emmett Bennett have added to his discussion.
                    The dividing line between the E and H appears to be deliberate and though it is
                    impossible to translate the inscription satisfactorily, an attractive suggestion
                    might be: "<foreign xml:lang="greek">stat' ei)=nai h(
                    w)/nh</foreign>" ‚Äî "a stater to be the price." This presupposes an
                    unprecedented contraction of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                    >sta/thr</foreign> (unit of weight and value) and a seemingly inflated price for
                    a vase, even a grand one such as this, during the mid-fifth century B.C.
                    Williams suggests, in addition, that the first word may be the vocative of
                        <foreign xml:lang="greek">stato/s</foreign>, which, from
                    temple inscriptions and the author Hesychius, may have meant a large vessel of
                    some sort. In any event the last part of the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek"
                       >*K*A*L</foreign> seems to be kalos, with such kalos names
                    scratched on the bottom of pots already discussed by <bibl
                       >L. Talcott, "Vases and Kalos Names from an Agora Well,"
                        Hesperia 5 (1936) 348</bibl>. Johnston writes informally and independently
                    that "stater" is intriguing but that as a commercial inscription it is not
                    typical. "The standing-ring is not commonly used like this, although it can
                    happen and the result is usually the same. The <hi rend="ital"
                        >lambda</hi> may be Attic or Chalcidian. The piece is presumably Attic,
                    though it looks like the type that has been taken as Chalcidian." The letter
                    forms seem to be those of the first half of the fifth century and, as there is
                    evidence of a stamnos costing two or three drachmai by mid-century, a stater
                    could be a possible price for a big and handsome dish (<bibl
                       >D. A. Amyx, "The Attic Stelai," <title
                            >Hesperia</title> 27 [1958] 275</bibl>).</p>
                <p>Lekane is the ancient word now most often applied to an all-purpose
                    basin, while lekanis is reliably used for a broad bowl or dish which was usually
                    lidded. On this vase the lid could conceivably be reversible, the flat knob and
                    thick stem easily becoming the foot for a shallow serving dish. Professor
                    Friis-Johansen was largely responsible for some of these lekanides being
                    considered "Chalcidian" (<bibl>CVA, Copenhagen 3,
                        Denmark 3, pp. 77-78, pl. 98-2, lekanis no. 521</bibl>). The continuous,
                    heavy profile of the bowl, the color of the clay ‚Äî "un brun clair
                    rougeatre" ‚Äî and the choice and treatment of the decorative schemes
                    ‚Äî slanting zigzags notably carelessly drawn ‚Äî lead him to the
                    designation. In fact the same design of zigzags on the oblique can be found
                    under a lotus frieze on a black-figure psykter in the same collection (<bibl
                       >CVA, Denmark 3, Copenhagen 3, pl. 98.1,
                        Copenhagen no. 326</bibl>) which is believably Chalcidian. The designs on
                    the Chicago vase, however, are executed with great care and attention and the
                    color of the clay is orange-pink and properly Attic. Some of the problems of
                    Chalcidian and Chalcidizing pottery are discussed in <bibl

                    shows not only the variety and stylistic development of the lekanis shape in
                    Athens but also its real popularity there (<bibl

                    Modern retouches on some unincised glazed areas. Black dots on shoulder may be

                    <hi rend="ital">Figure zone:</hi> Three, possibly four, men (l),
                    wearing himations and bearing walking sticks and spears from which hang animal
                    skins, file toward a woman (r.) who holds a skyphos and is wearing a headband,
                    himation and chiton. Beneath and behind the second man is a globular object and
                    a human forefoot. Seemingly isolated from these figures are two others in
                    combat; both hold shields. The man (r.) at left holds a sword and is nude except
                    for a pilos which is tied to his neck by a string. Vertical bars on rim and,
                    separated by dots, on shoulder.</p>
                <p>The shape is rare among Kabiric vases and resembles a stamnos, which
                    it has been called (<bibl>Brommer 1973, 431</bibl>),
                    without handles (<bibl>Philippaki 1967, p.
                    xviii</bibl>). Handled varieties do occur with a step foot (<bibl
                       ><title>JHS</title> 87 [1967] pl. 21</bibl>),
                    but the simple ring foot on this vase is typical of that found on Kabiric
                    kotylai. Other related Kabiric shapes regularly dispense with the handles of
                    their Attic counterparts (lebes gamikos: <bibl
                            ><title>AA</title> [1933] 27, fig. 27</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The primary scene is a caricature of Odysseus' men before Circe
                        (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.203">Hom. Od. 10.203
                        ff.</bibl>) who holds out a skyphos containing the infamous potion which
                    will change them into swine. As an added measure of her witchcraft she lays a
                    wand-like finger on a victim's brow. On four of the other five known Kabiric
                    vases with scenes referring to this episode, the loom of Circe is present. On
                    all but one of these (<rs type="vase">London B 77</rs>) Circe
                    stands before her loom, so it might also have appeared here on a missing
                    fragment. Odysseus' men appear mesmerized (by Circe's song?) as they waddle up
                    to her. Their ranks appear to have included at least four men, with the last
                    represented by only a glazed fragment (of a himation?). Odysseus is not to be
                    found among them since Homer clearly states that he approached Circe alone
                        (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.135">Hom. Od.
                    10.135</bibl>; for a contrary opinion, see <bibl
                        >Touchefeu-Meynier, <title>Th√®mes odyss√©ens,
                            infra,</title> 100-101</bibl>). The globular object straddled by the
                    second man is perplexing, if completely authentic, and with the trailing human
                    foot, it <hi rend="ital">vaguely</hi> recalls the swine-man on the
                    British Museum cup (<bibl><title
                        >JHS</title> 13 [1892-93] pl. 4</bibl>). The grapevine, common to Kabiric
                    vases in general, appears on the other Kabiric vases with the Circe episode,
                    except on the one in Oxford.</p>
                <p>The two combatants do not seem to be directly related to the Circe
                    myth and could be exchanged with the fragments containing the third and fourth
                    spear-bearers to create a continuous file toward Circe. Other armored duels are
                    known on Kabiric vases (<bibl>Wolters and Bruns,
                            <title>infra,</title> pls. 34:1 and 37:4</bibl>) but
                    none where an opponent wears a pilos. This type of traveler's hat is worn by
                    Cadmus and pygmies (<bibl>Wolters and Bruns, <title
                           >infra</title>, pls. 27:1 and 29:3; <hi rend="ital"
                           >JHS</hi> 84 [1964] pl. 5</bibl>) but also by Odysseus and
                    his men. Odysseus' popularity with the Boeotian vase painters perhaps stems in
                    part from his having been initiated into the rites of the Kabiroi (<bibl
                       >schol. Ap. Rhod. <title
                        >Argon.</title> 1.916</bibl>). The possibility is strong that here on the
                    Chicago vase Odysseus is involved in a Homeric venture distinct from the Circe
                    myth, just as he is on the Kabiric skyphos in Oxford (<bibl
                       >EAA, II, 238-239, figs. 360-361</bibl>).</p>
                <p>The aptitude for portraying the heads of his figures in convincing
                    detail sets this painter above most artists affiliated with the Kabiros Painter.

                <p>This vase was chosen for the contrast it provides with earlier
                    lekythoi in the exhibition, especially the one from the Elvehjem Museum of Art,
                    which is near the Timocrates Painter (<rs type="vase">Madison

                    those on the great lekythos by the Achilles Painter in Athens (<rs type="vase"

                    about by the Ten Years War, the first phase of the Peloponnesian Wars. The
                    drawing of the face on vases by Group R, the strength of the line here and
                    throughout the design, have led historians to see in these lekythoi reflections
                    of the contemporary mural painter, Parrhasios, whose works are lost. A similar
                    design is found on a lekythos (<rs type="vase">Chicago

                    rim 1.5 cm; th. 0.6 to 0.7 cm. Broken in two pieces and mended. The clay is
                    orange-brown in the break; the edges have been rasped. Good black glaze inside;
                    red wash, fired dark. Some cracking of glaze on outer surface, small chips,
                    nicks. The underside of the rim is reserved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> The outside of the rim
                    is decorated with egg and dot, the upper edge of the rim is black. A woman sits
                    to left on a piece of drapery folded over a rock, her feet crossed at the
                    ankles. Her head, of which the lower part remains, is turned right, her mouth
                    open. Her right hand is held out, her left stretched out behind her. The rock on
                    which she sits is indicated by lines sketched through the glaze before firing;
                    the same type of line shows the ground on which a chest is set in front of her
                    feet. At left remain two hands reaching toward her, at right, a hand and a bit
                    of drapery. The woman wears a chiton clipped at the shoulders, the bosom
                    decorated with sea-horses in reserve against a black background. A double tie
                    belts the chiton around her waist with loops at right and left sides. Her hair
                    was probably done in a chignon, of which only the broad preliminary outline
                    remains above her sakkos. Hair, in thinned glaze, escapes about her ear; she
                    wears a disk earring. Thin glaze appears to have been used for shading on the
                    right side of the lady's bosom, along her left side and along her left thigh and
                    knee. Relief outline appears only on the back of her neck, the bit of hip
                    between kolpos and drape, the big toe of left foot, and for top, side and bottom
                    of the chest on the ground. The preliminary broad outline is obvious. Sketch
                    marks are visible for the woman's neck, chin, arms, legs and what remains of the
                    sakkos; two parallel marks, as if intended for a staff, go through the woman's
                    figure from earring to tip of the folded drapery on which she sits; sketch marks
                    are visible on drapery at right and one mark indicates that it was started
                    further to the left; the line of the reserved band around the upper edge of the
                    lid was sketched first.</p>
                <p>The lekanis is a lidded, handled bowl, the knob of the lid usually
                    broad and flat so it might be used as a base when the lid is inverted (note that
                    the inside is covered with good black glaze, and cf. also <rs type="vase"
                       >University of Chicago 1967.115.60</rs>). Decoration, if any,
                    might be confined to the lid, or cover body and lid both; normally floral
                    pattern would be used on body, figured decoration on lid. The name is ancient,
                    but it is not certain that it was applied exclusively to this shape. Whatever
                    its proper ancient name, and whatever else its uses, from representations on
                    vases, from the literature, from tomb groups, we know that it was a shape
                    commonly used as wedding and funeral gift. The decorated lekanis comes into its
                    own in the last part of the fifth century and in the fourth, when Athens had
                    drawn into itself in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian wars, and much of the
                    best vase-painting is found on smaller vases with subject matter leaning toward
                    domestic scenes, Aphrodite and Eros, and Dionysos. Cf. <rs type="vase"
                       >University of Chicago 1967.115.60</rs>, by the Niobid Painter,
                    and see <rs type="vase">Chicago 1889.99</rs>.</p>
                <p>Johnson (infra) attributed this piece to the Jena Painter, a prolific
                    cup painter of the early fourth century, but Beazley apparently did not accept
                    the attribution, or at best had not checked it for himself, for it does not
                    appear in that painter's lists. Nor does any other lekanis, although Johnson
                    would have given him one in <rs type="vase">Brussels A 1015</rs>
                        (<bibl>CVA, Belgium I, Brussels I, III Id, pl.
                        4, no. 3</bibl>). Johnson compared the seated woman on the Brussels lid to
                    the Chicago one, and, indeed, the sea horses are present on the chiton bosoms of
                    both, which are shaped somewhat alike, too; both have a double loop tying the
                    waistband; on both the negative space between chiton top and drapery are
                    somewhat alike; the drapery about the left leg, the heavy outline of hip and
                    thigh, and the fall of the drape over the rocks are alike; the means of
                    rendering the rocky terrain is the same in both, by incision through the glaze
                    before firing. More interesting for us, around the other side of the Brussels
                    lid sits Dionysos, an Eros flying toward him at left, a maenad running from him
                    at right. The curve of her drapery is similar to the bit which remains on the
                    Chicago piece, and the position and shape of Eros' right hand, although better
                    drawn, is like that of the right hand at left on our fragment. The seated woman
                    is a regular element of the decoration of lekanides in the fourth century: she
                    may be associated with an Eros, or a maid, and there is usually a maid running
                    and looking around (<bibl>ARV2, 1496</bibl>). Thus,
                    on the evidence of the Brussels lid, we might expect the hands at left on the
                    Chicago fragment to belong to an Eros, the hand and drape at right to belong to
                    a running maid. These hands are like ones on pieces attributed to the Jena
                    Painter: cups in the <rs type="vase">University of Jena 383 and
                        386</rs>(<bibl>ARV2, 1511, no. 2 and 1512, no.

                    these cups and the rendering of the weights on the drapery are similar, too. The
                    Chicago lady's broad shoulders and full arms, long neck, and her lip and chin,
                    may be compared with those of Aphrodite on the inside of the cup <rs type="vase"
                       >Jena 390</rs> (<bibl>ARV2, 1511,
                        no. 1</bibl>; <bibl>Hahland, <title
                           >infra</title> pl. 22c</bibl>). A number of pieces
                    attributed to the Jena Painter show the sea-horses decorating garments. It was a
                    popular motif, however, on contemporary vases and on ones somewhat earlier and
                    later. It appears on the sleeved chiton of tragic actors (most appropriately
                    that of Andromeda, seen exposed for the delectation of a sea monster on a
                    calyx-krater in Berlin, <rs type="vase">Berlin F 3237</rs>: <bibl
                       >AJA 72 (1968) pl. 7, fig. 16</bibl>); later it
                    degenerates into pattern. Painters from the circle of the Meidias Painter and
                    the neighborhood of the Talos Painter use it; so do the Pronomos Painter, the
                    Suessula Painter, the Erbach Painter, the Meleager Painter. Whether the Chicago
                    lid and the Brussels one are by the same painter, and whether each or either
                    artist is the Jena Painter, I leave open. The Chicago piece is nearer,
                    certainly, to the work of the Jena Painter than to the rougher work of the
                    run-of-the-mill fourth century lekanides painters.</p>

                    hem of her drapery retouched; incision of figures of runners appears to have
                    been emphasized in white paint. The lid does not seem to belong to the vase.
                    Flaring mouth; raised fillet at junction of neck and body; round handles; convex
                    foot with deep groove directly below upper edge. Decoration in black glaze on

                    Pictures set in panels, framed by dilute glaze lines. The black-glazed lid is

                    right hand, she holds a spear; on her left arm is a round shield, the device
                    (scarcely visible) a floral wreath surrounding a small quatrefoil. Doric columns
                    on either side of the goddess support figures of bearded men, each draped from
                    the waist down in a himation and holding a cornucopia or drinking-horn in the
                    left hand and a thyrsos in the right. Beside the column at left runs the
                    inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*T*O*N *A*Q*E*E*Q*E*N
                        *A*Q*L*O*N</foreign> ("a prize from the games at Athens") in stoichedon

                <p>This vase is one of the three Panathenaic prize amphorae which
                    Beazley assigned to the Asteios Group (<bibl>ABV,
                        412</bibl>). The other two members of the group are <rs type="vase"
                       >Oxford 572</rs>, from Athens, inscribed with the archon's name
                    Asteios (<bibl>CVA, GB 14, Oxford 3, pl. 28,
                    4-7</bibl>), and <rs type="vase">Alexandria 18239</rs>, from
                    Cyrenaica, which bears the name of the archon Phrasikleides. No two of these
                    amphorae are by the same hand. The approximate date of manufacture of the vases,
                    ca. 375-370 B.C., is given by the archon inscriptions written beside the
                    right-hand columns on the amphorae in Oxford and Alexandria. Asteios was
                    eponymous archon in the year 373/372, Phrasikleides in the year 371/370.</p>
                <p>Early in the fourth century, the Panathenaic prize amphorae began to
                    be inscribed with the name of the archon for the year, a practice perhaps
                    prescribed by law, which enables us to date the vases.<note place="unspecified"
                        anchored="true">
                        <p>"Archon names on Panathenaic prize vases do not begin before
                            373/2 B.C., hence hardly 'early in the fourth century'." (Letter of
                            Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb. 1980)</p>
                    </note> The year, however, is not that of the Panathenaic Games at which the
                    amphora was awarded but the one in which the oil it contained was collected. The
                    Panathenaic amphora in Detroit is unusual in that it does not bear an archon
                    inscription. We have other Panathenaics without the inscription, for example,
                    one in the British Museum signed by the potter Kittos (<bibl
                       >ABV, 413, middle, and below, no. 1</bibl>); they may have
                    been intended as competition samples or as souvenirs of the Panathenaic Games,
                    rather than as actual prizes.</p>
                <p>Another innovation of the fourth century has to do with the figures
                    on top of the columns. Before that time, they were cocks, symbols of Athena's
                    fighting spirit. But early in the fourth century, at about the time of the
                    introduction of the archon inscriptions, the cocks disappear, and their place is
                    taken by small mythological or human figures, often reproducing a statue group.
                    The column symbols, as they are called, change from year to year and thus serve
                    as a clue to the dating of the vase. The symbols on the Panathenaic amphora in
                    Detroit are figures of men draped from the waist down in himatia; in the left
                    hand, they hold either a cornucopia or a large drinking-horn, in the right hand,
                    a thyrsos. This author has not been able to locate parallels to the figures,
                    whose identity remains a puzzle. They do not appear to be gods but rather
                    magistrates holding the attributes of divinities: the thyrsos of Dionysos and
                    the cornucopia, which might refer to Demeter or Ploutos, or the drinking-horn,
                    an attribute, like the thyrsos of Dionysos. The association may well be with the
                    Eleusinian Mysteries, which at the time were under the control of Athens. A
                    Panathenaic amphora in New York, belonging to the Kittos Group and dated by its
                    archon inscription 367/366, also bears symbols which refer to Eleusis (<bibl
                       >Para., 177, below, no. 3</bibl>). On top of the
                    Ionic columns, there are small figures of Triptolemos seated in a winged chariot
                    drawn by snakes. The name-piece of the Asteios Group, <rs type="vase"
                       >Oxford 572</rs>, in contrast, has symbols which clearly refer
                    to Athens: figures of Nike holding an <hi rend="ital"
                    >aphlaston,</hi> the stern of the trireme. Since the symbols for any given year
                    are the same, it would be possible to date the Panathenaic amphora in Detroit
                    more closely if we could find another amphora from the same time with identical
                    symbols and an archon inscription.</p>
                <p>The reverse of a Panathenaic amphora usually carries a representation
                    of the event for which the vase was awarded. On the Detroit amphora, the event
                    is the men's foot-race, the long-distance rather than the sprint to tell from
                    the long, easy stride of the runners. A similar representation appears on the
                    Panathenaic amphora in New York of the Kittos Group, referred to above. In both
                    pictures, the runners are shown in the old-fashioned scheme with the left leg
                    and left arm advanced. The vase-painters certainly understood correct
                    opposition, with diagonal arm-leg movement, for it appears on Panathenaic
                    amphorae of the fifth century. But the artists of the amphorae in Detroit and
                    New York have rejected the natural pose for one which goes back to black-figure
                    vases of the sixth century. The Asteios amphora in Oxford shows on its very
                    fragmentary reverse a scene of wrestlers with a trainer or judge and was thus a
                    prize for wrestling. The subject of side B of the Panathenaic in Alexandria is a
                    victor, in which event we cannot tell.</p>
                <p>Of the three members of the Asteios Group, the Panathenaic amphora in
                    Detroit is by far the best preserved. It is also the most interesting and
                    provocative, because of the puzzling nature of the figures atop the columns and
                    the absence of an archon inscription. Additional study of this very fine vase
                    would yield a better understanding not only of the work itself but also of
                    Panathenaic amphorae of the fourth century, a subject which cries for further
                    exploration.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> Max. h. 200 cm; max. w.
                    19.0 cm; th. 0.5 cm below to 0.6 cm above. There is preserved the major
                    decoration from the center of one side of a large closed vase. The fragment was
                    broken into several pieces and mended, with cracks in the black area restored.
                    There are some nicks and chips, and two long scratches through the seated
                    figure. There are two drill holes at the top, about 8 cm apart. The edges all
                    around the fragment have been rasped smooth. It is reserved inside, with
                    encrustation on only one piece; wide turning marks are visible. A red wash was
                    laid on unevenly over the reserved areas outside.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">Decoration:</hi> An arrival or
                    departure. A naked young man with wildly curling hair sits on the stump of a
                    leafless tree, arranging the fastenings of his sandal. A traveling hat, petasos,
                    hangs behind his neck. The drapery covering stump, protecting rump, is probably
                    his cloak. An elaborately dressed woman looks tenderly down at him while
                    beginning to move away, her face in three-quarter view. Both her garments are
                    embroidered, the sleeved chiton with broad detailed bands about neck and hem,
                    and down the front, the himation with circles. A sakkos covers her hair, curls
                    escaping about her cheeks. On her feet are soft shoes. In her right hand is a
                    ribbed oinochoe, in her left a libation dish, which looks rather like a short
                    loaf of French bread. Beneath the figures there remains the top part of a short
                    decorative baseline: single checker-squares separating two series of three
                    meander-squares each.</p>
                <p>There is an uneven passage below the man's right hand which should be
                    filled with black but was left reserved. Thin glaze was used for the hair of
                    both figures, for some shading on his sandals and on the embroidery of her
                    hemline, and in many places for outlines within the reserved areas (as that of
                    the petasos against the tree, and the upper lines of the woman's feet). Other
                    inner detail, which in earlier vase-painting was done in thin glaze, is here
                    done in very fine relief line, as the inner markings of the man's body, and even
                    the pubic hair. Relief outline is sparse: the outer line of the man's hip, a bit
                    of his upper right arm, the underside of his left thigh, his right leg above and
                    over the knee; the woman's left forefinger, right arm below elbow, right side of
                    face between hair and neck, part of the sakkos, heel of left foot. Several
                    relief lines marking pleats in the drapery falling over the stump extend through
                    the decorative base-line. Sketch marks are visible in many places. Marks show
                    that the horizontal strappings of the man's right sandal were started just below
                    the knee; marks below her elbow and near her shoulder show that the lady started
                    out shorter and slightly further to the left. There is no added color. The style
                    is named for an area of the Crimea where many of the vases were found ‚Äî
                    Kerch now, once Pantikapaion. Greeks had already reached the northeast shores of
                    the Black Sea by the end of the seventh century B.C. and were living there in
                    the sixth century, drawn by the agricultural land and the possibilities for
                    trade. In the fourth century there was a steady commerce between Athens and the
                    Black Sea, but "Kerch" vases were not made specifically for South Russia; they
                    have been found also in Greece and other parts of the Mediterranean. This was
                    the final act in the drama of Attic vase-painting. Its South Italian red-figure
                    progeny had long been playing under new direction. Loosed from the tight hold of
                    decoration to surface, the quiet, sculptural "Kerch" figures are often shown
                    lined up and looking out in pantomime for their curtain call; "static" and
                    "plastic" are often used to describe them. On the St. Louis fragment the short
                    sketchy lines molding the woman's drapery over her body, the face wholly or
                    mostly in view, the proportions of head and body reflecting trends in fourth
                    century sculpture, are characteristic of the Kerch style.</p>
                <p>The two figures here on their decorative ground-line were the only
                    decoration on one side of a large closed vase. It has been suggested that the
                    piece comes from a hydria, but the figure-zone seems too narrow for that, the
                    upper curvature too flat. Furtw√§ngler (<hi rend="ital"
                    >infra</hi>), saw the drilling as holes for lead clamps, but the holes are too
                    far apart. It was probably cut from a vase in antiquity, perhaps one already
                    broken, to hang as a votive or decorative plaque.<note place="unspecified"
                        anchored="true">
                        <p>"Furtw√§ngler was right in taking the two holes as part
                            of an ancient repair. They are not 'too far apart,' since the bronze or
                            lead staple or wire would connect the holes not with each other but with
                            corresponding holes in the vase directly above them, opposite the
                            break." (Letter of Dietrich von Bothmer to Warren G. Moon, 15 Feb.
                        1980)</p>
                    </note></p>
                <p>The subject could refer to a specific event or to a general
                    leave-taking or arrival. The oinochoe which the woman holds was no doubt meant
                    to represent a metal vessel, but counter-parts in black-glaze ceramic were also
                    being made at the time. The border pattern is a common one on contemporary
                    vases. The decoration has none of the added color, the molding or gilding which
                    is often found on Kerch vases, indeed, on ones by a painter with whom this
                    fragment has been associated, the Eleusinian Painter. There are three vases
                    attributed to the Eleusinian Painter (<bibl>ARV2,
                        1476f.</bibl>), two pelikai, brought together by Furtw√§ngler, and a
                    lekanis joined with them by Schefold, who named the painter for the subject of
                    one of the pelikai (<rs type="vase">St. Petersburg, St. 1792</rs>),
                    which shows the deities of Eleusis. Furtw√§ngler knew the lekanis and
                    published it in the same great work as the pelikai (<hi rend="ital"
                        >infra</hi>), where he also discussed this fragment. He thought the drawing
                    of the St. Louis woman and that of one of the lekanis figures, a woman holding a
                    mirror, so close that one painter might have done them both, but had
                    reservations about the sketchier drawing of the youth on the St. Louis vase.</p>
                <p>If this fragment can in fact be connected with the Eleusinian
                    Painter, it holds a place in the exhibition parallel to that of the entries by
                    the Niobid Painter (<bibl>Moon 1979, nos. 115 and
                        116</bibl>). The works of both have been associated with the great painters
                    of their times, those of the latter with the fifth century Polygnotos, the
                    Eleusinian Painter's work with Nikias, who not only painted murals, but also
                    colored the statues of Praxitiles (cf. <bibl>E.
                        Simon, <title>AntK</title> 9, no. 2 [1966] 86 and n.
                    83</bibl> and <bibl>Robertson, <title
                           >infra</title> 393</bibl>). As with the Niobid Painter's
                    works in the Midwest, the St. Louis fragment gives style, but no hint of the
                    monumental models which were accessible to the painter. The Kerch style has also
                    been compared with contemporary terracotta figurines, sculptured tombstones, and
                    engraved Etruscan mirrors.</p>

                <p><hi rend="bold">The Vase:</hi> h. 17.2 cm; w. 10.5 cm;
                    d. of base 6.5 cm. The flower on the extreme left side of her head, and the lock
                    of hair next to it are plaster replacements. The ends of the front locks of her
                    hair to the left of the center part are missing. Two flowers on her right side
                    have been reattached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="bold">The Head:</hi> The oinochoe is in the
                    form of a female head. The trefoil mouth is sharply articulated, with a handle
                    which springs from the mouth to the back of her head. Her hair is bound in a
                    sphendone. Above the head is a diadem of six flowers. Each flower is composed of
                    six double, flat petals with a rounded boss in the center. Her wavy hair has a
                    suggestion of a part and a top knot in the center. Grooves define the waves in
                    the central mass of her hair, with separate locks at the ends. Her brow is
                    smoothly curved with a change in plane marking her eyebrows. Her upper and lower
                    eyelids are in high relief. Lines indicate her upper eyelashes. The pupils and
                    the irises of her eyes are brown. Her nose is straight, in line with her
                    forehead, her full lips are clearly modeled. Two horizontal creases encircle her
                    neck. She wears round, flat earrings and a necklace of seventeen round beads.
                        <hi rend="ital">Accessory colors</hi>: the reddish terracotta
                    has been covered with light tan slip. <hi rend="ital">Black:</hi>

                    hair.</p>
                <p>This head of Persephone is very close to a vase now in the Hermitage
                    with the figure of a Sphinx, which Strogonoff described in the following terms:
