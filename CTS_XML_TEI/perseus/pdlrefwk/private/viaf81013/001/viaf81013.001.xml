							</app> is translated by Cicero, <hi rend="italic">ex altera parte
								respondere dialecticae</hi>, Orat. XXXII 114. ‘Vox a scena
							ducta videtur. Chori antistrophe strophae ad assem respondet, eiusque
							motus ita fit, ut posterior in prioris locum succedat...Significat ex
							altera parte respondere et quasi ex adverso oppositum esse; id quod
							etiam in antistrophen cadit.’ Trendel. <hi rend="italic">El. Log.
								Arist.</hi> § 14 p. 74: and to the same effect, <hi
								rend="italic">Comment. ad Arist. de Anima</hi>, II 11 5 p. 408.
								‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofon</foreign> dicitur
							quod alius rei quasi partes agit eamque repraesentat;’ Waitz, <hi
								rend="italic">Comm. ad Anal. Pr.</hi> I 2, 25 <hi rend="italic"
								>a</hi> 6. </p>
						<p>The term is borrowed from the manoeuvres of the chorus in the recitation
							of the choral odes. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*strofh/</foreign> denotes
							its movement in one direction, to which the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)ntistrofh/</foreign>, the counter-movement, the wheeling in the
							opposite direction, exactly corresponds, the same movements being
							repeated. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Diss. Eumen.</hi> p. 41. <hi
								rend="italic">Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> c. XIV § 4. Mure, <hi
								rend="italic">Hist. Gk. Lit.</hi> Bk. III. c. 1 § 15. Hence it
							is extended to the words sung by the chorus during the latter of these
							evolutions, and signifies a set of verses precisely parallel or
							answering in all their details to the verses of the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">strofh/</foreign>. And thus, when applied in its
							strict and proper sense, it denotes an exact correspondence in detail,
							as a fac-simile or counterpart. </p>
						<p>Hence in Logic <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ntistre/fein</foreign> is used
							to express terms and propositions which are <hi rend="italic"
								>convertible</hi>, and therefore identical in meaning, precisely
							similar in all respects. On the various senses of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)ntistre/fein</foreign> and its derivatives in
							Logic, see Waitz, u. s. In this signification, however, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> does not properly represent
							the relation actually subsisting between the two arts, the differences
							between them being too numerous to admit of its being described as an
							exact correspondence in detail; as I have already pointed out in the
							paraphrase (Introd. p. 134). </p>
						<p>It also represents Rhetoric as an art, independent of, though analogous
							to, Dialectics, but not growing out of it, nor included under it. The
							word is of very frequent occurrence in Plato (Gorgias, Republic,
							Philebus, Timaeus, Theaetetus, Leges), who joins it indifferently with
							the genitive and dative; and he employs it in this latter sense; as
							likewise Isocrates, <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ a)ntid</foreign>.
							§ 182; and Aristotle himself in several places; Polit. VI (IV) 5,
							1292 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 7, <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ e)/stin
								a)nti/strofos</foreign> (corresponding) <pb n="2"/>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">au(/th e)n tai=s o)ligarxi/ais w(/sper h(
								turanni\s e)n tai=s monarxi/ais</foreign>. c. 6 ult. 1293 <hi

						<p>Lastly, Waitz, u. s., points out a peculiar signification of it,
							‘res contraria alteri quam potestate aequiparat,’ in de Gen.
							Anim. II 6, 743 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 28. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>to\ yuxro\n suni/sthsin a)nti/strofon</foreign> (as a balance)
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">th=| qermo/thti th=| peri\ th\n kardi/an
								to\n e)gke/falon</foreign>. Trendelenburg, <hi rend="italic">Comm.
								ad de Anima</hi> u. s., after defining <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)ntistre/fein</foreign> as above, adds, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)nti/strofos</foreign> ex eadem chori similitudine significat <hi
								rend="italic">ex altera parte respondere</hi> (this is from Cicero,
							u. s.) Arist. Rhet. I 1; quod non significat, rhetoricam in dialecticae
							locum succedere (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> can be substituted for it,
							step into its place, as <hi rend="italic">a convertible term</hi>), sed
							quasi ex adverso esse oppositam (stands over against it, as a
							corresponding opposite in a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>sustoixi/a</foreign>, two parallel rows of coordinate opposites,
							like the partners in a country dance). Quintilian, Inst. Orat. II 17,
							42, <hi rend="italic">specie magis quam genere differunt.</hi>
						</p>
						<p>The term <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign> therefore
							applied to the two arts, seems to represent them as two coordinate
							opposites, or opposites in the same row (see Spengel on the study of
							Rhetoric, Munich 1842, p. 21). They are sister arts, with general
							resemblances and specific differences; two species under one genus,
							proof: both modes of proof, both dealing with probable materials, but
							distinguished by the difference of the two instruments of proof
							employed: the one <hi rend="italic">concluding</hi> by the formal
							svllogism, and by the regular induction, assumed complete; the other
							drawing its <hi rend="italic">inferences</hi> by the abbreviated,
							imperfect, conversational enthymeme, never complete in <hi rend="italic"
								>form</hi>, and by the single example in the place of the general
							induction. </p>
						<p>Rhetoric is afterwards described as <foreign xml:lang="greek">parafue/s,
								mo/rion</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(moi/wma</foreign>
								(<hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. II § 7). <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">parafue/s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>mo/rion</foreign> both express in different ways the relation that
							Rhetoric bears to Dialectics as the off-shoot, <hi rend="italic"
								>branch</hi>, or part; a species or variety of the <hi rend="italic"
								>general</hi> art of probable reasoning: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>parafue/s</foreign> as a subordinate shoot, growing out of the same
							root with the larger plant or tree,—a term so far corresponding
							with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>, but differing
							from it in making Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">subordinate.</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">mo/rion</foreign> reduces it to a still lower
							level in comparison with the other. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>o(moi/wma</foreign> implies no more than a mere general
							resemblance. </p>
						<p>In Sext. Empir. adv. Math. VII 6, occurs an explanation of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>, quite in character with
							the ordinary Greek etymologies, <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(htorikh/n,
								h(=s a)nti/strofon ei)=nai th\n dialektikh/n</foreign>, (not
							referring apparently to this passage, but most probably to the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">sunagwgh\ texnw=n</foreign>) <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">toute/stin i)so/strofon, dia\ to\ peri\ th\n
								au)th\n u(/lhn stre/fesqai</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">versari
								circa</hi>), as Homer called Ulysses <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)nti/qeon</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>i)so/qeon</foreign>. Alexander (infr.) gives the same explanation. </p>
						<p>Bacon <hi rend="italic">Adv. of learning</hi> Bk. II IX 3, has <hi
								rend="italic">antistrophe</hi> for ‘correspondence’,
							“and it hath the same relation or <hi rend="italic"
								>antistrophe</hi> that the former hath.” </p>
						<p>The points of correspondence and difference between the two arts have
							been already fully explained in the Introduction, p. 90 foll.: I will
							here give a summary of them from Alexander's <hi rend="italic"
								>Commentary on the</hi>
							<pb n="3"/>
							<hi rend="italic">Topics</hi>, p. 4. They are 1. that both of them are
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\ peri\ e(/n ti ge/nos
								a)fwrisme/non</foreign>; that is, that neither of them has any
							special subject-matter, like the sciences, but argues or perorates upon
							any thesis or subject whatsoever that can be presented to it. 2.
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ di) e)ndo/cwn kai\ piqanw=n</foreign>,
							no proof or conclusion, or principle, that they employ is more than
							probable; exact demonstration and necessary conclusions are excluded
							from both alike; <foreign xml:lang="greek">pi/stis</foreign>, belief,
							the result of mere persuasion, and not <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)pisth/mh</foreign>, the infallible result of scientific
							demonstration, being the object aimed at. 3. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>mh\ di) oi)kei/wn a)rxw=n</foreign>, they have no ‘special,
							appropriate’ first principles, such as those from which the
							special sciences are deduced; though they likewise appeal to the
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ koina/</foreign>, the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">koinai\ a)rxai/</foreign>, the ultimate axioms and
							principles common to all reasoning, which are above those of the special
							sciences, and from which the latter must be deduced. And, 4. they are
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(moi/ws peri\ ta\ a)ntikei/mena
								a)llh/lois</foreign>; they argue indifferently the opposite sides of
							the same question, and conclude the positive or negative of any
							proposition or problem; unlike science and demonstration, which can only
							arrive at one conclusion. Where the materials and the method are alike
							only probable, every question has, or may be made to appear to have, two
							sides, either of which may be maintained on probable principles; in
							Dialectics and Rhetoric no certainty is either attained or attainable.
							The chief points of difference between them are, that Dialectics deals
							practically as well as theoretically with every kind of problem or
							question that can be submitted to it; proceeds by question and answer,
							in the way of debate, and its discussions are of a more general or
							universal character; whereas the subjects of Rhetoric are practically,
							though not theoretically, almost absolutely limited to Politics; it
							follows a method of continuous narration or explanation (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">diecodikw=s</foreign>), and deals in its
							conclusions rather with individual cases than with general principles or
							universal rules, maxims and axioms. </p>
						<p>Alexander, in a preceding passage, gives the following very extraordinary
							account of the derivation and original meaning of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)nti/strofos</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>to\ ga\r a)nt. a)nti\ tou= i)so/strofo/n te kai\ peri\ ta\ au)ta\

								a)fwrisme/non</foreign>, opposed to <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\
								tou= doqe/ntos</foreign>. Polit. I 13, 1260 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>

							The preposition is similarly used in the compound <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)poble/pein</foreign>, which is ‘to look
							away, or off’, from all surrounding objects, so as to fix the
							attention on one particular thing, or turn it in one particular
							direction. Comp. Lat. <hi rend="italic">de</hi>finire, <hi rend="italic"

						<p>Parallel passages, in which this same characteristic of Rhetoric and <pb

							Aristotle here assumes this to be theoretically the only true and proper

							inactive, (<hi rend="italic">consopitum</hi>, ‘gone to
							sleep’, Buttm.,) in the sentence, is explained by Buttmann in his
							note on Dem. Mid. § 15, p. 530. The conditional <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> belongs to some verb in the
							apodosis, originally expressed, afterwards left to be understood, as in
							the clause before us. The expression at full length would be, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ka)\n, ei)/ tis poih/seie, poih/seie</foreign>,
							‘as one would do, if he were to do’. Still, though the
							particle has lost its direct and active force in this sentence, some
							latent notion of conditionality always remains, even when the verb which
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> supposes cannot actually be
							supplied. This is the case in such phrases as <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>fobou/menos w(/sper a)\n ei) pai=s</foreign>, Pl. Gorg. 479 A
							‘fearing as a child would’: Ar. parva naturalia <foreign

							habit and association, when the sense no longer requires it. The phrase
							accordingly is not found in the earlier forms of the language, and does
							not become common till the time of Plato and Aristotle, with whom, the
							latter especially, it is very frequent. The association required time
							before it was established as a fixed habit. I believe that it does not
							occur in Thucydides, and that it makes its first appearance in Xenophon;
							that is, in the forms above given; for as an unnecessary appendage to a
							participle, or in cases <hi rend="italic">analogous</hi>, <foreign

								<lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)podido/nai</lem>

								<hi rend="italic">reddere;</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po/</foreign> as in <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)pone/mein, a)polamba/nein, a)paitei=n,
								a)po/plous, a)poplei=n</foreign> (see Sturz. Lex. Xenoph.), from
							which all the other senses in which at least Aristotle employs it may be
							deduced. Another of the original senses of the word is ‘to give
							forth’, or ‘produce’, as the earth produces her
							fruits, and this also <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be applied to the
							interpretation of it in several of its various uses. But as this
							signification is likewise deducible from the other—for production,
							as <pb n="12"/> when the earth produces her fruits, may be regarded as a
							payment or restoration, or ‘return’ of something <hi
								rend="italic">as due</hi>—it may perhaps be better to refer
							them all to the one original signification, <hi rend="italic"
								>reddere.</hi> So in Eth. N. II 1, 1103, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
							27, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 22, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s

								‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)podido/nai</foreign> proprie est

						<p><app>
								<lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)podido/nai</lem>

						<p>It may be worth while to say a few words on this very common usage of

							emphatically to mark a critical point, climax, degree attained, as

							all particles of time, and derive this their secondary sense from the
							metaphorical application of this notion of ‘already’, a
							definite time which we have just reached: ‘point’, or
							‘stage’, or ‘degree’ attained being substituted
							by the metaphor for ‘time’ in the original sense of the
							word. </p>
						<p>This will be best illustrated by a few examples. Arist. <foreign

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kaia le/cas h(=sson eu)glw/ssou

							natural superiority over falsehood and wrong, the proper use of Rhetoric
							is to enable them to assert and enforce that superiority; to bring truth
							to light, and detect and expose deceit and sophistry. If the opposites
							of truth and right <hi rend="italic">do</hi> ever prevail over these, it
							must be the fault of the parties concerned themselves, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)na/gkh di) au)tw=n h(tta=sqai</foreign>, who have
							failed to avail themselves <pb n="23"/> of this powerful instrument.
							Rhetoric is therefore ‘corrective’ or ‘remedial’
							of the perversion of truth and right to which legal decisions are always
							more or less liable from misrepresentation of facts, fallacious
							arguments, or the blinding of the judgment by appeals to the feelings. </p>
						<p>According to this translation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">di)

							Whereas if we follow Victorius (and Spengel who assents to his view, <hi

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">di) au)tw=n</foreign> by <foreign

							are distinguished from the ordinary <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							predicables. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">sumbebhko/ta pa/qh toi=s

							lines’: still the property is deducible from the definition, and

						</p>
						<p>Quintilian touches on this subject in many places of his work; the most
							detailed account of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> is given in the second
							chapter of his sixth book: the description and distinction of them occur
							in §§ 18, 19. They are both referred, as subordinate species,
							to the general head of ‘<hi rend="italic">affectus</hi>’,
							§ 8, comp. § 12; and these are again distinguished from the
							direct and logical arguments, § 3. In this and the following
							section he compares these two classes of arguments together in respect
							of their rhetorical value and importance, and comes to a conclusion
							precisely opposite to that of Aristotle. For Aristotle holds that these
							indirect proofs, though necessary to the orator by reason of the
							deficiencies and infirmities of his audience, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>dia\ th\n tou= a)kroatou= moxqhri/an</foreign>, III 1 § 5, and
							therefore not to be excluded from the theory or practice of Rhetoric,
							yet are to be regarded as merely auxiliary and subordinate, standing in
							the same relation to the direct proofs as dress and personal ornaments
							to the body, serviceable but not essential. Quintilian on the contrary
							pronounces that these in comparison with the overpowering force of the
							appeals to the feelings are only not contemptible in respect of their
							power of persuasion; <hi rend="italic">quos equidem non contemno, sed
								hactenus utiles credo ne quid per eos iudici sit ignotum; atque ut
								dicam quod sentio, dignos a quibus causas diserti docerentur</hi>
							§ 3: that those that use them therefore are only fit to lay before
							the judges the facts of the case, not to influence their decision, and
							to instruct the real advocate, who can sway their minds and feelings at
							his will, and force them to decide in favour of his client: <hi
								rend="italic">ubi vero animis iudicum vis afferenda est, et ab ipsa
								veri contemplatione abducenda mens, ibi proprium oratoris opus
								est</hi> § 5. </p>
						<p>It may be observed in concluding this note, that there is a somewhat
							important difference, which I have already pointed out in the
							Introduction, between Aristotle's view of the use to be made of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in the practice of Rhetoric, and
							that of the Latin Rhetoricians, as well as the author of the Rhet. ad
							Alex.; see c. 39 (38) 2. Quintilian's <hi rend="italic"
							>auctoritas</hi>—and compare Cicero in de Oratore, II
							43—expresses the influence of character upon opinion, in general:
							but in Aristotle's system the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>
							means something more; the effect must be produced immediately <hi

							‘simply’, opposed to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>sunqe/sei</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
								sumplokh/n</foreign>: and this appears to be the primary sense of
							the word, in accordance with the derivation. Thus as the elements of
							nature are often called <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(pla=
								sw/mata</foreign> in their simple, uncombined state, so we have
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a(plw=s</foreign>, de Anima II 14, 8, to

							to ‘duplicity’, (Plat. Rep. III 397 E, <foreign

						<p>The commonest signification however is that of (2) <hi rend="italic"
								>simpliciter et sine exceptione</hi> ‘generally’ or

							second imitatives (as <pb n="46"/>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">turannia=|n</foreign>, to play the tyrant);
							“but,” he adds, “it is improper to rank verbs denoting

								xml:lang="greek">o)fqalmia=|n, u(deria=|n, ywra=|n</foreign>,

							having a thing or quality, and performing an action; as <foreign

						<p>A much better and more exact account of these forms of verbs, in respect

							Lobeck's learned note on Phrynichus, p. 79—83. “Verbs in
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a=|n</foreign> and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ia=|n</foreign>,” (this is not true of <hi

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dama=|n, geitnia=|n, pera=|n</foreign>,
							for instance, can hardly be said to denote either a bodily, or mental
							affection. It should be “<hi rend="italic">some</hi> verbs”
							or “a large class of verbs in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>aw</foreign>”) “in <hi rend="italic">both</hi> forms,
							are properly used of affections of mind and body. <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">splhnia=|n, to\n splh=na a)lgei=n, liqia=|n,

							all <hi rend="italic">desideratives</hi> (which have either of these
							terminations) express some affections of the mind, either as a malady, a
							longing, or in some other form.” This is an amplification of what
							Lobeck actually says: and it is <hi rend="italic">also</hi> I think
							implied that the bodily affection is the primary signification, which is
							extended by metaphor to the mental. A long list of examples is there
							given, chiefly of rarer words. I have collected some examples from

							must fix the number of the divisions or branches of Rhetoric. Audiences

							games, or in any exhibition where amusement is the object, or at all
							events where there is no interest of a <hi rend="italic">practical</hi>

							(2) of right or wrong in respect of <hi rend="italic">past</hi> acts or

						<p>So that we have three kinds of audiences, and consequently three branches

							‘spectators’, those who go to be amused or interested by the
							show-speeches, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pidei/ceis</foreign>, the
							Panegyrics (in two senses), funeral orations, burlesques, or whatever
							other form may be taken by speeches composed merely to display skill in
							composition without practical interest (where the <foreign

							negative, see Hermann's excellent dissertation in his Review of
							Elmsley's Medea, on lines 4, 5. Porson, Elmsley, and their English

							of Greek grammar, which were supposed to admit of no exception; any

							services rendered by Hermann to the study of the Greek language is the
							relaxation of these over exact rules, and the substitution of a rational
							and logical explanation of these differences of expression, and the
							analysis of their distinctions, for these often unwarranted alterations
							of the text. ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek">*kai\</foreign> particula
							est coniunctiva’, says Hermann; ‘<foreign xml:lang="greek"

							according as the writer had or had not any notion of a <hi rend="italic"
								>difference</hi> between them. If the things under the general
							negative conception are represented <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> as
							subordinate and with no expression of difference of opposition between
							them, the <hi rend="italic">adnexive</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">te</foreign> is employed, and the formula is
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)...te...te</foreign>, or <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ou)...ou)/te...ou)/te</foreign>, and similarly with
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh/</foreign>: on the other hand, if some
							difference between any of the subordinate members of the division is to

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign>, and the formula will be
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)...ou)de/</foreign>, or <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ou)de/...ou)de/</foreign>, or <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ou)... ou)/te...ou)/te...ou)de/</foreign>, and so
							on for other similar cases. And the change of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>te</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> in the
							second clause of the sentence before us, represents the sudden
							occurrence to the writer's mind of the thought that there is an
							important difference between the two things that are assigned as reasons
							for not introducing a regular scientific division into the treatment of
							Rhetoric (viz. its necessarily unscientific character, and the fact that
							its <pb n="60"/> province has already been unduly extended by previous
							professors), which requires to be marked, and accordingly is marked by
							the change of the particle. This, however, is not the only irregularity
							in Aristotle's sentence; for, evidently intending at the commencement to
							include both the subordinate members under the original negative, he
							introduces in the second clause a positive conception; contributing
							perhaps to enforce the distinction of the two, but in violation of
							grammatical accuracy. </p>

							(implying a knowledge of causes and effects) in <hi rend="italic"

							the propositions of all arts and sciences, and the axioms common to them

							subject-matter, taking opposite sides of the same question indifferently

									>zeu=gma</foreign>, the illicit conjunction of the two
								heterogeneous notions or expressions under one <hi rend="italic"

								abundantly illustrated from the works of Tacitus by Bötticher
								in his Lex. Tacit., Proleg. <hi rend="italic">de Stili Taciti

									>comprehenduntur</hi>’<hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as I
								have failed to enter into the distinction which Bötticher makes
								between the two varieties I will substitute my own explanation of
								the difference. In <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/llhyis</foreign> the
								two terms are united in one construction with a third, to which one
								is referred <hi rend="italic">literally</hi>, the other <hi
									rend="italic">metaphorically</hi>, or at all events in different
								senses. This appears in the instances given, as <hi rend="italic"
									>dissimulationem nox et lascivia exemerat: nocte ac laetitia
									incaluisse: praeda famaque onusti: mixti copiis et

								English writer the case of Miss Bolo in <hi rend="italic"
									>Pickwick</hi>, who after her defeat at whist in the Bath

								Hel. 182, <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)gai=sin e)n tai=s xruse/ais

									<foreign xml:lang="greek">zeu=gma</foreign> proper, this third
								term will not apply in <hi rend="italic">any sense</hi> to <hi
									rend="italic">both</hi> of the others, and some other word or
								phrase must necessarily be <hi rend="italic">supplied</hi> to
								complete the sense; as in the passage of Herodotus quoted above, and
								in the text of Aristotle. Add to the examples collected from Tacitus

								this <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> is the truly Irish epitaph on
								Boyle the Philosopher: ‘He was the father of Chemistry, and
								grand-uncle of the Earl of Cork.’</note> (a mere carelessness

							speech’, as it is briefly expressed in Liddell and Scott's
							Lexicon, ‘wherein two subjects <hi rend="italic">are used

								>u(pa/rcai</foreign> here a future sense, ‘to become or to be
							made’, which does not naturally, <hi rend="italic">ex vi

							thrown so much light upon the niceties of Greek grammar (on Ajax 1061
							subsequently referred to without further discussion in the treatise <hi
								rend="italic">de Part.</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> IV, 2, <hi rend="italic"
								>Opuscula</hi>, Vol. IV), contends against Elmsley (who had
							condemned as a solecism this use of the aorist infin. without <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>, after verbs such as <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">dokei=n, nomi/zein, oi)/esqai, fa/nai, e)lpi/zein,
								prosdoka=n</foreign>, in reference to future time) in support of the
							usage; and distinguishes three modes of expression in which futurity is
							conveyed by the infinitive: first, the simple future inf. as <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">dokei=n pesei=sqai</foreign>, which conveys
							directly the simple and absolute notion of futurity, without
							modification or qualification; second, the infin., aorist or present,
							with <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n, pi/ptein a)/n, pesei=n
								a)/n</foreign>, which indicates a merely conditional futurity, might
							or would fall, under certain circumstances or conditions; and thirdly,
							the present or aorist infin. without <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n,
								pi/ptein</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">pesei=n</foreign>,
							which, corresponding to the indefinite (in point of time) present and
							aorist, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pi/ptei</foreign> and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)/pese</foreign>, denote simply the possibility or
							likelihood of the object falling at some uncertain future time; <hi
								rend="italic">caducum esse.</hi> The distinction between the <hi
								rend="italic">present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aorist</hi>
							infinitive is this: ‘Praesentis autem et aoristi infinitivis, sive
							accedat <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> sive non, ita utuntur,
							ut aoristus rei transeunti, praesens duranti adhibeatur.’ </p>
						<p>Without disputing the truth of this, it is yet possible to explain the
							difference otherwise. <hi rend="italic">Permanence</hi>
							(‘duranti’) does not seem to me to be in any way connected
							with the conception of present time, though the perfect often is; as
							when we say ‘this <hi rend="italic">has been</hi>’ up to the
							present time, we often imply our belief in its continuance; and I should
							rather explain the present infin. in these cases as expressing the mere
							fact of the existence of the thing named, or the abstract notion of it.
							The present tense, as it is called, I act, I do, to act, to do, is in
							reality independent of time: the time present is, I am acting, I am
							doing; and the present infin. ‘to do’ is the naked
							conception of ‘doing’ without any connotation of time (so
							the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> infinit. with the definite article
							stands for a <hi rend="italic">substantive;</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ ei)=nai</foreign> is the mere notion of
							being). The aorist infin. again may derive its notion of futurity and
							likelihood, either, as Hermann thinks, from the indefiniteness expressed
							by the tense, or, in other cases, from the connotation of <hi
								rend="italic">habit</hi>, implying <hi rend="italic">liability</hi>,
							which is also one of its acquired senses. The broad distinction will be,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dokw= pesei=sqai</foreign>, ‘I think
							it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> fall’, at some future time, and
							nothing more: <foreign xml:lang="greek">dokw= pi/ptein</foreign> or
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pesei=n a)/n</foreign>, ‘I think it
								<hi rend="italic">could, would</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">might</hi>
							fall’, under certain conditions; <foreign xml:lang="greek">dokw=
								pi/ptein</foreign>, ‘I think the notion of falling belongs to
							it’, ‘I think it <hi rend="italic">may</hi> fall’;
							that is, that it is <hi rend="italic">liable</hi>, or <hi rend="italic"
								>likely</hi>, to fall, <hi rend="italic">caducum esse</hi>: and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dokw= pesei=n</foreign>, implying also the
							liability or likelihood of the preceding, is distinguished from it
							(according to Hermann) by <pb n="66"/> representing the act or event as
							transient and not permanent. But such a distinction as this last, though
							it be intelligible, is at least untranslatable; as in such a case as
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">noei=s dra=sai</foreign> (Soph. Phil.
							918), ‘what dost thou intend to do’, where the expression of
							the liability must needs be omitted, and still more the transient nature
							of the proposed act. But we can hardly suppose that any distinction can
							be seriously intended when Sophocles writes <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>noei=s dra=sai</foreign>: and then, three lines afterwards, v. 921,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dra=|n noei=s</foreign>. The choice
							between the two seems to be dictated rather by convenience than by any
							other motive. </p>
						<p>With regard to the distinction of the present and aorist infin., it may
							be observed, that we are often obliged, as the practice of translation
							shews, to disregard whatever difference there may be conceived to be
							between them, as either inappreciable or at all events inexpressible,
							and to render them by the same English words. Take, for example, the
							ordinary phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei= labei=n</foreign> (it
							occurs, for instance, II 8, 12). It is quite certain that in this case
							past time is not directly signified; though it may possibly be included
							as an accessory in the notion of it in the way of an addition to the
							abstract conception of ‘taking up, acquiring’—as
							representing the <hi rend="italic">previous formation</hi> of the
							opinion, which has been <hi rend="italic">taken up</hi> before. But at
							all events no one would think of <hi rend="italic">translating</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">dei= labei=n</foreign> in any other form than

								xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. On the definition of Rhetoric, see
							Introd. p. 13; and on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> definition of
							happiness, p. 176. </p>
						<p>Aristotle's own definition of happiness in the Eth. Nic., the result of
							his inquiries in that work, is something far different, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia yuxh=s kat' a)reth/n</foreign>, the
							fully developed activity or active exercise (implying full
							consciousness) of the soul in respect of its proper (and therefore
							highest) excellence: that is contemplation, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>qewri/a</foreign>, the exercise of the highest faculty, the
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>, or intuitive reason; the
							highest faculties being the <hi rend="italic">intellectual.</hi> This is
							the theory; but practically a lower view of happiness is admitted (Bk.
							X), which consists in the exercise of the moral as well as the
							intellectual virtues. Of the definitions here given, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">au)ta/rkeia zwh=s</foreign> comes nearest to his
							own: it expresses a self-sufficing life, complete in itself, independent
							of all external aids and advantages, and is in fact essential to the
							notion of happiness. See Eth. Nic. I 5 (quoted below). </p>
						<p>The essentials of the three first of these definitions are found all
							united in the conception of happiness, the ultimate end of all human
							desire and effort, which forms the conclusion of the tenth book of the
							Nicomachean Ethics, from the sixth chapter to the end. It contains
							first, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)praci/a met' a)reth=s</foreign>,
							in the exercise of moral and intellectual virtue, the intellectual being
							the higher and more perfect form of it, and in that the intuitive
							contemplative energy; secondly, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>au)ta/rkeia th=s zwh=s</foreign>, the self-sufficiency and
							independence of everything external, which is necessary to perfection
							and happiness; and thirdly, the life <foreign xml:lang="greek">met'
								a)sfalei/as</foreign>, the happiness residing in <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">qewri/a</foreign> being most secure because it is
							most independent and the nearest approach to the happiness of the Gods,
							who have all their wants and faculties satisfied in themselves, and want
							nothing &lt;*&gt;m without (c. 7); and also <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>h(/distos</foreign>, because pleasure is the necessary

								>qewri/a</foreign> being the most perfect form of <foreign

						<p><app>
								<lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)leuqe/rios</lem>

								rend="italic">species</hi> of liberality, that namely which
							manifests itself <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ do/sin xrhma/twn kai\
								lh=yin</foreign>. Eth. Nic. II 7. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)leuqe/rios</foreign> represents the gentleman <pb n="81"/> from
							the democratic point of view; he embodies the notion of ‘freedom
							which is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ros</foreign>, the principle,
							and the end and aim of the democratic commonwealth; he is the type of a
							free citizen, and therefore as expressive of <hi rend="italic"
								>character</hi> the term denotes ‘that which a model free
							citizen ought to be’; and connotes or implies those
							qualifications, particularly education and enlightenment, which enable
							him efficiently to discharge the proper functions of a free citizen, and
							those social qualities and habits which fit him for such a society. This
							is opposed to the aristocratic conception of a gentleman which makes the
							character or notion depend rather upon birth, wealth and station; and
							according to which the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gaqoi/, a)/ristoi,
								a)risth=es</foreign>, the <hi rend="italic">boni, optimi,
								optimates</hi>, &amp;c., are the nobles, the men of rank, and of
							good family in a state. See further on this subject, Donaldson, <hi
								rend="italic">New Cratylus</hi>, §§ 321—328. </p>
						<p>Another characteristic of Greek feeling, which deserves notice, is
							brought into view in the application of the term <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)leuqe/ria</foreign> to distinguish a particular
							kind of property; and this is, the contempt for trade and commerce as a
							profession and a means of acquiring wealth, which as B. St Hilaire
							observes (note on <hi rend="italic">Transl. of Ar. Pol.</hi> p. 36) was
							common to all antiquity. A similar observation is made by Böckh,
								<hi rend="italic">Publ. Econ. of Athens</hi>, Bk. I c. 8 p. 43
							(Transl.). </p>
						<p>Plato's writings abound with contemptuous epithets and expressions
							applied to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mpori/a, kaphlei/a,
								xrhmatistikh/, xrhmatismo/s</foreign>, and all arts and professions
							of which money-making was the only object; for instance, Legg. IV 1, 705
							A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mpori/as ga\r kai\ xrhmatismou= dia\
								kaphlei/as e)mpipla=sa au)th/n, h)/qh pali/mbola kai\ a)/pista tai=s

							demoralizing. In XI 4, 918 D, in the course of a discussion on the

							of them) <foreign xml:lang="greek">diabe/blhtai/ te kai\ e)n ai)sxroi=s
								ge/gonen o)nei/desin</foreign>, which results from their general
							tendency to corrupt the character of those who follow these pursuits, by
							the immoderate desire of gain which they stimulate and foster.
							Accordingly no citizen of the model state is allowed to follow any
							retail trade; this must be confined to metics and strangers, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">me/toikon ei)=nai xrew\n h)\ ce/non o(\s a)\n

							431. </p>
						<p>Aristotle similarly condemns trade and the business and practice of
							interchanging commodities, so far as its object is mere money-making,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">xrhmatistikh/</foreign>. This is the
							accumulation of <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi>, artificial property:
							the only kind of property or wealth that is natural, <foreign

								xml:lang="greek">oi)konamikh/</foreign>, from which <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">xrhmatistikh/</foreign> is excluded. Pol. I 9.

							Aristotle, between <foreign xml:lang="greek">xrh/mata</foreign>, wealth
							or property which you can <hi rend="italic">use</hi> directly, which
							does you direct service, and money, which is excluded from the notion of

							approves of nothing but the agricultural mode of life as the best both

							2. Of the two, <foreign xml:lang="greek">poihtiko/s</foreign> is most
							frequently used in the expression of this conception, as may be seen in

						<p>All moral virtues must necessarily be each a form of good: for they

							pleasure is good (though not necessarily <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							good) is in both the treatises on pleasure, in the 6th and 10th books of
							the Nicomachean Ethics, carefully investigated and discussed, and the
							opinions held upon the question by preceding philosophers, as Eudoxus
								<pb n="102"/> and Plato, examined, Bk. VII, c. 12, seq. and X, c. 2.
							Aristotle's conclusion (in Bk. X) is that though pleasure may be
							regarded as good it is not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> good, i.e. the
							supreme good, good in itself, because there are <hi rend="italic"
								>some</hi> pleasures which are not proper objects of choice and
							therefore not good. Eudemus (if the seventh book be his), seems rather
							to be inclined to the contrary view; it is said at any rate, c. 14,
							init., <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/gkh ou)=n th\n h(donh\n a)gaqo/n

								>o(/ti d' ou) sumbai/nei dia\ tau=ta mh\ ei)=nai a)gaqo\n mhde\ to\
								a)/riston, e)k tw=nde dh=lon</foreign>. This difference of view
							between the master and pupil (on the supposition that eudemus is the
							author of Bk. VII) is in fact in exact conformity with the difference of
							their respective definitions of pleasure; Aristotle defining it as the
							perfecting (<foreign xml:lang="greek">telei/wsis</foreign>) of the
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, but not our <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign> itself, and therefore not
							‘the supreme good’; whilst Eudemus goes further and
							describes it as an ‘unimpeded energy’, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)nempo/distos e)ne/rgeia</foreign>: and in fact
							this variation may be regarded as one of the principal arguments for the
							difference of authorship of the two treatises on pleasure in the Nic.
							Eth. The principle upon which the fact is here assumed in the Rhetoric,
							is stated in both treatises of the Ethics; the universal recognition,
							namely, of the principle that pleasure is desirable. See VII 14 init.

							towards him, which is assumed to be hostile, it shews that you can have
							done him no harm: and therefore that you have been wanting either in
							courage or patriotism or energy and skill). Of this the example of the
							Corinthians is now a real instance, and their suspicion of Simonides'
							intentions may be traced to the general rule. ‘And this was why
							the Corinthians conceived the suspicion that they had been insulted by
							Simonides, when he wrote, ‘Ilium has no fault to find with the
							Corinthians’ (which it ought to have had if they had done their
							duty). The Corinthians misinterpreted Simonides’ expressions; his
							intentions were innocent, but he failed to perceive the inference that
							might be derived from them. The line of Simonides is apparently
							misquoted by a lapse of memory. The Schol. Pind. Ol. XIII p. 78, who
							cites it, has <foreign xml:lang="greek">mani/ei</foreign> (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">i^</foreign>) for <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							‘found no fault’, with the Corinthians, and Aristotle
							remembered it when he used the example, it seems that the instance is
							very ill chosen for the purpose of illustrating the rule. In this case
							nothing is imputed to the Corinthians except that the aid of Glaucus and
							his men of Corinthian race compensated the Trojans for their own
							hostility, and therefore that Troy had nothing to reproach them with,
							which could scarcely be construed by them as an <hi rend="italic"

								me, less successful in his grammatical explanation. I think that

								note. Trendelenburg, who takes nothing into account but the possible

								selects the last of the three as that which belongs to the dative in
								this phrase. <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ mege/qei
									ei)=nai</foreign> express, according to him, ‘the abstract
								conception (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ ei)=nai</foreign>)
								belonging to (given to and received by) magnitude’: making
								this dative depend solely upon <foreign xml:lang="greek"
									>ei)nai</foreign>, and leaving out the attraction to a word in
								the dative, actually or hypothetically preceding, as in any way
								concerned in the ‘government’ of it. This is all that I
								have to object to in Trendelenburg's paper: in the rest he has shewn
								the same ability and intimate knowledge of his author which

							construction is analogous to <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste
								sullabo/nti ei)pei=n</foreign>, I 10, 18. Other instances of a

							actual crime (which is not ‘the beginning’); and, secondly,

						<p>Leodamas of Acharnae was a famous orator, an earlier contemporary of

							rival of Demosthenes; indeed in his opinion even pleasanter to listen
							to. He is mentioned again in II 23, 25 (comp. the note there); in Dem.
							adv. Lept. 501 and 502, who also speaks of him as a distinguished
							orator, where allusion is made to a certain proposition of his to cancel
							the ‘grant’, especially the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

								on his trial? Or two separate trials? (this seems improbable): or
								has Aristotle made a slip of memory in assigning the accusation of
								Chabrias to Leodamas? None of these suppositions is necessary to
								reconcile the, at first sight, conflicting statements. The
								accusation of Leodamas is directed against <hi rend="italic"
									>both</hi> parties; he takes the case of Callistratus first, and
								then secondly (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/lin de/</foreign>)
								applies the converse of the argument which he had issued against the

								393, note 3, who does not refer to the passage of Aristotle, assigns
								the trial or trials of Callistratus and Chabrias to this period, 366
								B. C., and the alleged misconduct about Oropus. The other speech of
								Leodamas against Chabrias, referred to by Dem. adv. Lept. l. c. was
								earlier, and had nothing to do with the affair of Oropus. [Arnold

							two speeches of his, Rhet. I 14. 1, and III 17. 14. Leodamas' accusation

								>morality</hi> remains constant; for vice is still represented as

							a kind of polity in which education is the qualification for a share in

							controlled by the government and conformed to its established
							institutions. This is the ‘education established by the law’
							of the text. On the absolute necessity of this kind of training in
							virtue under state direction for grown men as well as children, see Eth.
							N. X 10, 1179 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 32 seq., and the unfinished

							parts of the intellect, <foreign xml:lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign>
							practical wisdom, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign>
							speculative wisdom or philosophy, in Bk. VI. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>sofi/a</foreign> is omitted in the detailed explanation of the
							virtues, most likely because it has very little in common with Rhetoric,

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, so that it belongs to
							all the three divisions of our moral nature distinguished in Eth. Nic.
							II 4. The anonymous mean between <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							</app>] In the chapter on this virtue of ‘gratitude’ in the
							Nic. Ethics, III 11, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> (as
							it is there written) is first defined in general terms as a virtue
							residing in a mean state in things that inspire confidence, or
							encouragement, or boldness, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\
								qarrale/a</foreign>, on the one hand, and fear on the other: its
							sole object and aim in choosing a course of action and encountering
							danger being <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ kalo/n</foreign>, the right
							and noble as an ultimate end, because it is so, and for no other reason;
							which implies also the opposite, the spurning of what is base and
							disgraceful. This is the general notion of fortitude, the endurance of
							pain, labour, danger, in the pursuit of an unselfish, honourable, high
							and noble object, when the opposite course would be base, mean,
								disgraceful<note anchored="true">Acts of fortitude must likewise be
								deliberate and voluntary, <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei= d' ou) di)

							then distinguished five popular notions of ‘courage’,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> in a narrower sense,
							none of which can be properly called ‘fortitude’. The first
							of these is <hi rend="italic">political courage</hi>, the courage of a
							citizen, as a member of a state, and living under and directed by its
							laws, described in 1116 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 17—<hi
								rend="italic">b</hi> 2. And this seems to be the view of courage
							which is taken here, the terms employed in each corresponding very
							closely, <foreign xml:lang="greek">dokou=si ga\r u(pome/nein tou\s
								kindu/nous</foreign> (this restricts the virtue to facing <hi
								rend="italic">danger</hi> and gives it a narrower sense than
							‘fortitude’) <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( poli=tai dia\ ta\

							Eudem. III 1. 13, as belonging to political courage, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">mi/a me\n politikh/: au(/th d' e)sti\n h( di)
								ai)dw= ou)=sa</foreign>, and another § 16, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">dia\ no/mon de\ h( politikh\ a)ndrei/a</foreign>.
							The prominence of the military character of this virtue is likewise
							marked in the description both of the Ethics and Rhetoric by <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">u(pome/nein tou\s kindu/nous</foreign> in the one,
							and by <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/rgwn e)n kindu/nois</foreign> §
							8, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(...e)n pole/mw|</foreign> § 6,
							in the other; so that it seems that there is sufficient warrant for the

						<p>The third virtue, <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign>, <hi
								rend="italic">temperantia</hi>, is likewise represented under a <hi
								rend="italic">political</hi> aspect. It is a virtue by which men's
							bodily appetites are regulated according to the dictates of the laws of
							the state, ‘are so disposed towards bodily pleasures as the law
							enjoins’. In Eth. Nic. III cc. 13, 14, there is no regular
							definition of it; but we gather from the contents of the two chapters
							that it is a virtue of self-control, which consists in a mean state with
							regard to the indulgence in bodily pleasures, (pains having less to do
							with the virtue); and in a due <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> or
							estimate of the value of them. It is thus a ‘mean’ between
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign>, ‘excessive
							indulgence in them’, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)naisqhsi/a</foreign>, total ‘insensibility’. II 7,

							in the Ethics and Rhetoric respectively, is that in the latter they are
							regarded solely on the side of their utility to society—a
							political view—in the Ethics they are confirmed habits or states
							resulting from a due regulation of the elementary <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> out of which they are formed and
							developed. They are ‘relative means’, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">meso/thtes pro\s h(ma=s</foreign>, mean states
							varying in individuals according to the special character of each, lying
							at a variable distance between two extremes of the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> out of which they grow, the proper
							mean in any given case being determined by the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>fro/nhsis</foreign> or practical wisdom, the objective standard
							being the collective judgment of those who are specially endowed with
							this faculty, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fro/nimoi</foreign>.

							the preceding, as a virtue which is ‘productive of
							benefits’, shews its utility, ‘on a large scale’; to
							which ‘little-mindedness’, meanness of spirit, is the
							opposite. This is a very different and much narrower view of the virtue
							than that which is conveyed by the description of it in Nic. Eth. IV
							7—9, which is summed up in the brief phrase at the end of c. 9,

							of virtue are illustrated in the examples by <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							equally <foreign xml:lang="greek">kala/</foreign> and praiseworthy (see
							note on c. 7. 27); but in the single case of justice this does not
							universally apply, for <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ dikai/ws
								zhmou=sqai</foreign>, just (deserved) punishment, is not equally
							praiseworthy with a just act, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ dikai/ws
								pra/ttein</foreign>, but the contrary; since it is more disgraceful
							than an <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> punishment. (This seems to be a
							mere fallacy of <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(mwnumi/a</foreign>,
							ambiguity, <hi rend="italic">equivoque</hi>, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>dikai/ws</foreign> not standing in the same relation to <foreign

							to the actor, but to the law and the judge who inflicts the punishment.
							A similar equivocal meaning lies in the word <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qos</foreign>: in the rule and the general application of it, it
							stands for properties or attributes: in the special exception it denotes
							an ‘affection’ in the sense of suffering or punishment.)

							here; the only cases that it can be applied to are chance or accident,
							nature, and external compulsion, under which all actions are said to be
							involuntary, i.e. in which the will has no concern; and this is true.
							But in the Ethics, the actions there in question are not said to be
							involuntary—the doer meant to do what he did—but acting in
							ignorance, he acted unintentionally, in so far as he did not intend to
							do the mischief that followed. But this ignorance from which the

							has no place here; ignorance is not included in an act done by chance,
							nature, or external compulsion. </p>
						<p>Now as we act voluntarily in all these four cases in which the impulse is
							from within and action in our own power, it follows (from the preceding)
							that the object of all voluntary action is some form either of real or
								<pb n="199"/> apparent good, or of real or apparent pleasure;
							including, in the good, real and apparent, the removal of evil and the
							substitution of a greater good for a less, because all these are
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ai(reta/</foreign> (desirable), objects of
							choice; and in the case of pleasure, the entire removal of pain and the

						painful, §§ 3, 4. Consequently all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>
						desires and appetites produce pleasure by their gratification: and these
						fall into two classes, bodily appetites and mental desires, the former
						irrational and connected with the pleasures of sense, the latter rational,
						in so far as they are of an intellectual character, suggested and acquired
						by some kind of intellectual process of the nature of persuasion, § 5,
						and conveyed by a faculty, <foreign xml:lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>,
						intermediate between sense and intellect. The analysis <pb n="200"/> of
						these intellectual pleasures (which include the pleasures of imagination,
						memory and anticipation, of love and friendship, and its counterfeit,
						flattery) occupies §§ 6—20. In the remainder of the chapter
						other kinds of intellectual pleasures are distinguished, and referred to the
						principles implied in the definition. </p>

						<p>Twining in his note on Poet. IV 4 (note 22, p. 186 seq.) in describing
							and illustrating this doctrine of Aristotle, remarks that ‘he does
							not see how any <hi rend="italic">information</hi> can be said to be
							acquired by the spectator’ (or listener) from the mere <hi
								rend="italic">identification</hi> of two objects, the inference that
							‘this is that’. And this remark is true if this were all
							that Aristotle means by his doctrine. The mere identification of an
							object compared with one already known conveys no <hi rend="italic"
								>new</hi> knowledge, which is essential to <pb n="219"/> the notion
							of <hi rend="italic">learning.</hi> But what seems to be Aristotle's
							real meaning is (as I have expressed it above) that by the comparison of
							the representation with the original, whether it be a picture, or a
							trait of character in a tragedy, or a metaphor, you <hi rend="italic"
								>learn</hi> something <hi rend="italic">new</hi> in this respect;
							that the representation, in proportion to its accuracy and finish (the
							number of <hi rend="italic">details</hi> introduced), enables you to <hi
								rend="italic">discover</hi> or <hi rend="italic">observe</hi> by the
							comparison something new in the object which you had never observed
							before: and this is the ‘inference’ from the resemblance,
							which the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sullogismo/s</foreign>, here and in
							the Poetics, is intended to express. On the love of imitation, and the
							pleasure derived from the imitation of objects in themselves

							the source of the pleasure and the motive of the action in either case.
							In the former the motive is benevolent, and the pleasure is that of

							‘wisdom’, or the reputation of it—this is not the same

							it carries with it—Now ‘wisdom’ may be understood in
							two senses; ‘practical wisdom’, <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							exercise because it implies power, in the shape of influence over the

							wonder, § 21, because it brings with it the knowledge of all sorts

							finding fault with our neighbours and friends, <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							to the pleasure of exercising power so frequently noticed before. Here

							implies an advantageous contrast between ourselves and those whom we
							thus ‘tax’, a superiority in judgment or virtue, which gives
							us the right to <pb n="223"/> find fault; and the honour we all love is
							reflected upon ourselves by the contrast. But the pleasure lies

							sometimes at the end of nearly every chapter. It expresses the
							completeness and sufficiency of any action or process, that a thing has

							and no more need be said or done about it. Thus <foreign

							let it suffice to have said so much, let this be considered sufficient,
							and the subject closed; and let us now ‘have done with it’,
							and go on to something else. It is not peculiar to Aristotle, though
							very much more common in him than in other writers. It occurs <pb

								xml:lang="greek">o(/mws de\ ei)rh/sqw moi</foreign>, ‘be
							satisfied with my saying so much’, let it suffice to have said so

						<p>Men of different characters are influenced by different motives in the

							Of this Zeno we learn from Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Diodorus
							(see the reff. in Brandis' Art. in Smith's <hi rend="italic">Dict.

							of her tyrant: and if the attempt was successful (of which we are not

							have mixed personal considerations with his public and patriotic
							motives, just as Harmodius and Aristogeiton did, as Aristotle tells us
							in the Politics (VIII (V) 10), in their attack upon the Athenian tyrant.
							Only it seems unlikely that if this were the true explanation of the
							allusion that Aristotle would have spoken of tyrannicide as an <foreign

							expedition to Sicily for the liberation of his native country. By his
							conduct and services he had ingratiated himself with Dion's mercenaries,
							whom he incited to murder their general, and thereby made himself master
							of Syracuse. Before this, he had spread calumnious reports about Dion
							and excited the citizens against him. Dion being informed of this took
							no precautions for his own safety; partly in scorn of the attempt, and
							partly because he was unwilling to preserve his own power and life at
							the expense of the destruction of his friends: the scheme accordingly
							took effect, and Dion was shortly after put to death. Aristotle says
							upon this that Callippus justified the act by arguing that as Dion had
							now knowledge of his designs, and his own life <pb n="242"/> was in

							for human errors and infirmities: all which is contained in the
							principles of equity, the unwritten law which prescribes such a course
							of conduct in matters of doubt. I have observed in the Introduction p.
							244 that we are probably to extend this subordinate kind of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)/grafoi no/moi</foreign> so as to include all the
							prevailing feelings and opinions as to propriety and right and wrong in
							general which prevail in each <hi rend="italic">special</hi> state (and
							are therefore a kind of <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/dios
								no/mos</foreign>, distinguished from the universal): of which indeed

						<p>The two kinds of unwritten law are, <hi rend="italic">first</hi> the
							universal law, the precepts of which suggest higher considerations and
							higher duties than mere legal obligations to pursue virtue and avoid
							vice (this is what is meant by the ‘excess, or higher degree, of
							virtue and vice’ above the legal standard, expressed in <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">kaq' u(perbolh\n a)reth=s kai\ kaki/as</foreign>,
								<hi rend="italic">quod eximiam virtutem aut vitium inde
								continet</hi>, Victorius), obedience to which law is rewarded by
							praise and honour and gifts (the two kinds of rewards; the
							‘gifts’ in this case being conferred of course not for their
							value as a pecuniary compensation, but in so far as they are signs of
							moral approbation) and the breach or violation of it punished by (not
							fine or imprisonment or any personal penalty, as the violation of a <hi
								rend="italic">legal</hi> enactment, but by) censure, reproach,
							dishonour (not deprivation of civil rights, which is a <hi rend="italic"
								>legal</hi> penalty): of such precepts examples are, gratitude to
							benefactors, the return or repayment of obligations (differing from the
								<hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> of gratitude), <pb n="255"/> the
							inclination and readiness to aid and defend one's friends, and such
							like. It is remarkable that amongst the precepts of the universal law
							which we are all bound to obey Aristotle should have here omitted the
							duty of interring and paying honour to the dead, so strikingly
							exemplified by the appeal of Antigone against Creon's tyrannous
							proclamation in the play to which he himself had just called our
							attention (comp. Eur. Suppl. 16—19, 526, 538), and still more so
							perhaps in the trial of the eight generals after Arginusae. </p>

							occasionally mentioned by the poets and other non-scientific writers:
							they are the most general rules of conduct which every one everywhere is
							supposed to recognise and obey. A short list of the most fundamental of

								<hi rend="italic">et passim</hi>,) it denotes ‘wrong,
							fallacious, false, <hi rend="italic">reasoning</hi>’, a
							‘fallacy’ in argument. Lastly <foreign xml:lang="greek"

						<p>‘In the case of justice, the opposite is true’. That is, the
							magnitude or strength of the just and virtuous disposition, inclination,
							resolution, is shewn, not now in the trifling character of the
							temptation or motive by which it is led astray, but in the greatness of
							the temptation which it withstands. ‘Ut qui ingentem vim auri,
							apud se nullo teste depositam, cum infitiari impune possit, reddidit,
							iustior sit necesse est quam si idem in exigua pecunia fecit.’
							Victorius. Injustice varies inversely with the magnitude of the profit
							or advantage to be derived from it, the less the temptation the greater
							the sin; justice directly, the greater the profit and the consequent
							temptation to do wrong, the higher the virtue in foregoing it: as, the
							greater the deposit, the greater the justice in restoring it. </p>
						<p>‘The reason of this’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek"

							religious uses would be capable of any other iniquity whatsoever’.
							The <foreign xml:lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, the indefinite latent
							capacity of vice, is tacitly opposed to the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, any possible enormity, to which it may, or
							may not, be developed. If a man will commit a crime which may be

						<p>‘Now sometimes the degree of crime, the comparative criminality,

						<p>The accuser in a criminal process, where the penalty was not already

							<pb n="264"/> is concerned, the reason might be, that the accuser is

							estimate. At the same time as <foreign xml:lang="greek">tima=n</foreign>
							and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/mhma</foreign> may denote an

						<p>‘And the frequent commission of the same offence magnifies

						<p>‘And the more brutal the crime is, the worse’; that is, the
							nearer approach it makes to the conduct and instincts of a mere animal
							or brute, who is incapable of virtue and self-control; and the more
							cruel, savage, ‘inhuman’ it is, more degraded below the
							level of humanity. </p>
						<p>There are three degrees in the scale of natures, moral and intellectual,
							(1) the beast, (2) the man, and (3) the god. Thus, Pol. I 2, 1253 <hi
								rend="italic">a</hi> 27, it is <pb n="265"/> said of a man that is
							incapable of society, or is in want of nothing, being all-sufficient to
							himself, that he is <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ qhri/on h)\
								qeo/s</foreign>: in respect of this complete independence he is
							either below or above all the various wants, instincts, affections,

							same view appears in the little disquisition on <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">qhrio/ths</foreign> at the opening of Book VII of
							the Nicom. Ethics, except that here the distinction between the three
							natures is made to rest solely upon intellectual and moral virtue: this
							is human, whereas the beast and the god are alike incapable of it, the
							beast, from the defects already stated, being below the human standard,
							the gods above it. </p>
						<p>On this superiority of the gods to the practice of moral or human virtue
							and their entire independence of it, see Eth. Nic. X 8. A fine fragment
							of Cicero's lost dialogue <hi rend="italic">de Philosophia sive
								Hortensius</hi>, quoted by Augustine, <hi rend="italic">de
								Trinitate</hi> XIV c. 9, is manifestly borrowed, not translated,
							from this passage of Aristotle. It is printed in Nobbe's edition of
							Cicero, p. 1171, fragm. 35. </p>
						<p>Here therefore ‘brutality’ consists in the absence of all
							capacity for virtue, moral and intellectual, and is consequently opposed
							to <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n u(pe\r h(ma=s a)reth/n, h(rwikh/n tina

							‘Barbarous’ and ‘barbarity’ in fact express

						<p>the father of Critias being Solon's brother, Dropides. These verses,
							which were probably intended by the author as a compliment to the

							the son, whose recklessness and licentiousness had brought upon him his
							father's displeasure: the authority of Solon is appealed to to shew that
							the grandson inherited his grandfather's vices. Whether <foreign

							perversion of Cleophon, on the hypothesis that red hair implies a
							licentious disposition, or depravity in general—as seems to have

								>entre poil roux et félonie s'entreportent grant
								compagnie</hi>, (Wace, <hi rend="italic">Roman de Rou</hi>, quoted
							by Sir F. Palgrave, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Norm.</hi> II
							721)—or Aristotle, quoting from memory, has <hi rend="italic"
								>mis</hi>quoted, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, cannot now be

								>Solon</hi> intended any such imputation on Critias' character,
							whatever may have been the case with Cleophon; for <pb n="277"/> Critias
							is evidently considered as a boy or very young man from the tone of the
							address or message, and Victorius shews from Theocr. Id. VIII. 3,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/mfw tw/g' h)/thn pur)r(otri/xw, a)/mfw
								a)na/bw</foreign>, that red hair in a boy in the eyes of the Greeks
							was a beauty and not a deformity. It seems to me that Solon wrote
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">canqo/trixi</foreign>, as Proclus gives
							it, and that the other reading is due either to Cleophon's malice if we
							interpret it <hi rend="italic">in deterius</hi>, or to Aristotle's want
							of memory, if we take it as synonymous with <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>canqo/trixi</foreign>. The evidence of Critias' <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)se/lgeia</foreign> derived from the verses is
							plainly a false inference of Cleophon and not really contained in the
							original: the statement in Plat. Charm. 157 E, that Solon wrote Elegies
							in praise of ‘the house of Critias’, and spoke of its
							members as ‘distinguished by personal beauty and virtue and all
							other so-called happiness’, is altogether against any such
							supposition. Victorius, who regards the inference drawn by Cleophon as
							justified by the language of the verses, endeavours to reconcile this
							with the eulogistic character of the elegy, by the remark that Critias
							may have been an exception to the general good character of his family.
							Bergk, <hi rend="italic">Poet. Lyr. Gr.</hi> p. 331, follows Proclus'
							version. The other variation, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)pei=n
								moi</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)pe/menai</foreign>,
							may be either another slip of Aristotle's memory, or <foreign

						<p>Analogous to this view of law as a contract is the theory, in Politics,

							and mutual advantage in obedience to laws and an executive authority
							which the theory supposes to have emanated originally from themselves,

							the conquered, amongst them that of enslaving, and result from a sort of
							international compact, or universal agreement. Polit. 16, sub init.

							God, into the metaphysical conception of the Universe as One, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e(\n to\ o)/n</foreign>— appears to have
							conveyed his philosophical doctrines in hexameter verse, an example
							subsequently followed by Parmenides and Empedocles. He also wrote
							elegies and iambics, the latter directed against Homer and Hesiod, whose
							manner of speaking about the Gods he disapproved, Diog. Laert. IX 2. 18.
							The verse quoted <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is a trochaic tetrameter;

							Xenoph. Fr. 25, p. 106, note, ‘cuius versiculi hiatus in voce

							in the converse of Xenophanes' maxim, § 30, is what is contained in
							the verse itself. I have no doubt they are right. On Xenophanes and his

							The first, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ qreptiko/n</foreign>, the life

							“to the nature of true anger, the discomposure of mind from the
							circumstance of <pb n="11"/> another man's intention in working evil
							against us, and the cure of this discomposure by the submission or
							suffering of the agent.” I will only add one remark upon this

								xml:lang="greek">o)ligwri/a</foreign>, the contempt and indifference
							to our feelings and sense of personal dignity implied in the notion of
							‘slight’, as the main cause of the emotion of anger, he is
							thinking only of the angry passion as excited against a fellow man. Yet
							we are angry with a dog that bites, or a cat that scratches us<note

								‘to bind’, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"

									>xrh=sqai, xrei/a</foreign>, by which human conduct is directed

								xml:lang="greek">sumbebhko\s kaq' au(to/</foreign>, and therefore
							added to the <hi rend="italic">definition</hi>—because there may
							be cases in which an insult or injury arouses no angry feeling, when the

							offender or of a very abject and submissive temper, or if the power of
							the aggressor is so great and imposing, that the injured person is
							terrified and daunted instead of angry, II 3. 10. So at least Aristotle:
							but I am more inclined to agree with Seneca on this point, who to a
							supposed objection to his definition, <hi rend="italic">cupiditas
								ulciscendi</hi>, replies thus, de Ira, I 3. 2, <hi rend="italic"
								>Primum diximus cupiditatem esse poenae exigendae, non facultatem:
								concupiscunt autem komines et quae non possunt. Deinde nemo tam
								humilis est, qui poenam vel summi hominis sperare non possit: ad
								nocendum potentes sumus.</hi> And anger is apt to be blind and
							unreasonable. This is an answer to I 11. 9, already referred to. </p>
						<p>The definition therefore of anger in full, is as follows: ‘an
							impulsive desire, accompanied by pain (and also pleasure, as is
							afterwards added), of vengeance (punishment of, and compensation for, an
							offence) visible or evident (in its result), due to a manifest (and
							unmistakeable) slight (consisting, or shewn) in (insults, indignities,
							wrongs) directed against ourselves, or (any) of our friends, when (we
							feel that) the slight is undeserved’; or literally, ‘is not
							naturally and properly belonging to us’, not our <hi rend="italic"
								>due</hi>, in consideration of our rank and importance or of our
							personal merits and qualifications. </p>
						<p>Bacon's Essay, <hi rend="italic">Of Anger</hi>, has one point at least in
							common with Aristotle's delineation of it. “The causes and motives
							of anger are chiefly three. First to be too sensible of <hi
								rend="italic">hurt;</hi> for no man is angry that feels not himself
							hurt... The next is, the apprehension and construction of the injury
							offered to be, in the circumstances thereof, full of <hi rend="italic"
								>contempt:</hi> for contempt is that which putteth an edge upon
							anger, as much or more than the hurt itself.” “For raising
							and appeasing anger in another; it is done chiefly by choosing of times,
							when men are forwardest and worst disposed, to incense them. Again, by
							gathering all that you can find out to aggravate the contempt.”

							but inanimate things may occasionally cause an imperfect form of it to

							Aristotle, includes under the same head, ‘the irascible

								>shall</hi> obtain the object of his desire, the punishment of the

							feels pleasure in the prospective satisfaction. The first of the two
							following lines of Homer, Il. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*s</foreign>
							109, has been already quoted in illustration of the same topic, the
							pleasure of anger in the prospect of revenge, I 11. 9. In the passage

								xml:lang="greek">ou)dei\s tw=n fainome/nwn a)duna/twn e)fi/etai
								au(tw=|</foreign>, may seem at first sight to be contradicted. The
							two statements are however different: Seneca says that a man may <hi

							Aristotle says that he never <hi rend="italic">aims at it</hi>, never
							uses any exertion to attain to that which he knows to be <pb n="14"/>
							<hi rend="italic">un</hi>attainable: which is equally true. No one ever

						<p>But this anticipation of the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> is not the

							accompanied by yet another pleasure, the <hi rend="italic">present</hi>
							pleasure of dwelling in the mind on the prospective vengeance: it is the
							fancy that then arises (presents itself) that produces the pleasure in
							us, just like that of dreams’. On the pleasures of the <foreign

						<p>Schrader refers to an excellent illustration of this pleasure of dwelling

							beginning, <hi rend="italic">me miserum, vix sum compos animi, ita ardeo
								iracundia</hi><note anchored="true">See also ‘on the pleasure
								of irascible emotion,’ Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and
									Will</hi>, c. ix. § 4. Mr Bain acknowledges, though he
								regards it as anomalous, the painful fact that pleasure at the sight
								of suffering inflicted, especially under circumstances of violent
								excitement when the passions are already inflamed, as at the sack of
								a captured town, is in reality a phenomenon of human nature. Other
								examples of this are the notoriously cruel habits of children in
								their treatment of animals, and in their ordinary sports; the
								pleasure found in gladiatorial combats, bull fights, bear baiting,
								cock and quail fights, and all the other cruel exhibitions which
								have <hi rend="italic">amused</hi> the most civilized as well as
								barbarous spectators. He traces this to three sources, of which the
								principal is the love of power. I will venture to add three more
								possible elements of the emotion, which may contribute, without
								superseding the others, to the production of it. First, the sense of
								contrast between the suffering which we are witnessing in another
								and our own present immunity: this is the principle implied in
								Lucretius' <hi rend="italic">Suave mari magno</hi>, and is
								illustrated in I 11. 8, of this work. Secondly, it may be partly
								traced to curiosity—the pleasure of learning, as Aristotle
								calls it—and the stimulus of surprise or wonder which we feel
								at any exciting spectacle; another source of pleasure mentioned by
								Aristotle in the same chapter. And thirdly, <hi rend="italic"
									>perhaps</hi>, a distorted and perverted sympathy (this is an
								ordinary source of pleasure), which gives us an <hi rend="italic"
									>independent interest</hi> in the sufferings of any creature
								whose feelings, and consequent liability to suffering, we
								share—that is, of all <hi rend="italic">animated</hi> beings;
								with inanimate objects there can be no sympathy.</note>. </p>

							different contexts, the two sides of the youthful character, and the
							good and bad qualities by which it is specially distinguished. On the
							one hand, they represent the gallant, spirited, vigorous, impetuous,
							nature of youth (<foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)= kai\ gennai/ws, a(/te
								ne/os w)/n</foreign>, Plat. Soph. 239 B), on the other the
							petulousness, wantonness, insolence, which sometimes characterises
								it—<hi rend="italic">protervus, ferox, superbus</hi>, Ast, <hi
								rend="italic">Lex. Plat.</hi> s. v. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>neaniko/s</foreign>. Both senses are abundantly illustrated in
							Plato. I will only quote Soph. 239 D, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/ tis
								tw=| neani/a|</foreign> (this audacious, impertinent, youngster)
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s to\ e)rwtw/menon

							Suppl. 580, Arist. Vesp. 1333, and interprets the word ‘de homine
							feroci insolentique’; and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>neanieu/esqai</foreign>, as exemplified in Lysias’ speech
							(Phaedr. 235 A), which ‘ran riot’, ‘passed all bounds
							of moderation’ in the endeavour to shew, &amp;c.; and (according
							to Callicles, Gorg. 482 C) in that of Socrates, who had been talking
							like a mob-orator, ‘running riot, luxuriating in language full of
							exaggeration, extravagance.’ So that ‘to play the youth, act
							like a young man’, sometimes means rash and arrogant, wanton,
							insolent, overbearing, extravagant, licentious conduct. The examples of
							both these words in Demosthenes display a leaning towards the more
							favourable view of the youthful character. —Plat. Euthyd. 273 A,

								>o)rgh/</foreign> or indeed a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qos</foreign> at all. If we compare <foreign xml:lang="greek"

								>prao/ths</foreign> is inactive and leads to nothing but the
							allaying, subduing, lowering, of the angry passion, which it reduces to

					<p>Prof. Bain's remarks on shame—<hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>,

						under the general head of Emotions of Self, and in the subordinate division
						under that of self-love. “The feeling of shame is resolved by a
						reference to the dread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others.
						Declared censure and public infliction, by inviting the concurrent hostile
						regards of a wide circle of spectators, constitute an open shame. One is
						also put to shame by falling into any act that people are accustomed to
						disapprove, and will certainly censure in their own minds, although they may
						refrain from actually pronouncing condemnation. This is the most frequent
						case in common society. Knowing the hard judgments passed upon all breaches
						of conventional decorum, it is a source of mortification to any one to be
						caught in a slip; they can too easily imagine the sentence that they do not
						actually hear. The character of the pain of all such situations exactly

							of which are given in the note above referred to,) this seems to be more
							appropriate to what follows, and to the nature of the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> itself: for the feeling of pity is
							strong in proportion to the vividness with which the suffering is
							brought home to us<note anchored="true" n="2">A remark of Lessing, at the
								end of the first section of his <hi rend="italic">Laokoon</hi>, will
								serve as a commentary on Aristotle's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
									>fainome/nw|</foreign>. “<hi rend="italic">Alles stoische
									ist untheatralisch; und unser mitleiden ist allezeit dem leiden
									gleichmässig welches der interessirende gegenstand
									äussert. Sieht man ihn sein elend mit grosser seele
									ertragen, so wird diese gross seele zwar unsere bewunderung
									erwecken, aber die bewunderung ist ein kalter affekt, dessen
									unthätiges staunen jede andere wärmere leidenschaft,
									so wie jede andere deutliche vorstellung,
								ausschliesset.</hi>”</note>. The actual sight of it, when we
								<hi rend="italic">see</hi> the effect of the injury (and perhaps
							also a graphic description of it from an eye-witness), gives it a
							reality and a force which <pb n="94"/> intensify our sympathy. That this
							is Aristotle's meaning appears most clearly from a subsequent passage,
							§ 8, where these painful things are enumerated, and are found to be
							all of them bodily affections: and still more perhaps from § 14,
							where the effect of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn
								poiei=n</foreign> is described. Aristotle has omitted, designedly or
							not, all mention of mental suffering: perhaps he thought that not being
							actually <hi rend="italic">visible</hi> it was incapable of exciting
							pity. See further on this in note on II 8. 8. </p>
						<p>Again, this view of the meaning of the word is in exact agreement with a
							preceding observation upon pain, II 4. 31, that ‘all painful
							things are objects of sense, (that is, all feelings which can properly
							be called painful are excited by sensible objects,)<note anchored="true"
								>This however seems to require some qualification: it is true of
								course of all bodily pain; but are not certain mental states, as
								doubt, suspense, uncertainty, disappointment, also painful? In the
								case of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/leos</foreign>, Ar. probably
								means that at least some sensible image, a mental representative, or
									<foreign xml:lang="greek">fantasi/a</foreign>, proceeding from
								some object of sense, is required to excite the painful feeling. But
								surely we can pity the mental as well as the bodily sufferings of a
								friend, provided he makes them sufficiently distinct and
								intelligible to us.</note> and the greatest evils, as wickedness and
							folly, are the least sensible; for the presence of vice causes no
							pain’. Victorius, who however does not refer to this passage, has
							pointed out that the kind of evil which excites pity is distinguished
							and limited by the epithets <foreign xml:lang="greek">fqartikw=| kai\
								luphrw=|</foreign>; which upon the principle laid down in c. 4. 31
							excludes the greatest evils, moral and intellectual, as objects of pity. </p>

							Emotions. This appears to be a juster view of the nature and connexion
							of the feeling than the account given by Aristotle. The fact is, as I
							have elsewhere stated<note anchored="true" n="2"><hi rend="italic">Review
									of Aristotle's System of Ethics</hi>, 1867, p. 52.</note>, that
							the conception of general benevolence and love and duty to our

							in Aristotle's Ethical System: the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>xa/ris</foreign> of the preceding chapter includes but <pb n="95"/>
							a small part of it, being in fact confined to doing a service to a
							friend in need. Again the limitation of pity to those sufferings to
							which we ourselves or our friends are exposed, ascribes a selfishness to
							the emotion which seems not necessarily to belong to it. In fact if this
							were true, the God of the Christian, and the gods of the heathen would
							be alike incapable of it. Hobbes, in accordance with his theory of
							universal selfishness, goes beyond Aristotle in attributing the feeling
							solely to self-love. <hi rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Pt. I. c. 6,
							‘Grief for the calamity of another is Pity; and ariseth from the
							imagination that the like calamity may befall himself; and therefore is
							called also Compassion, and in the phrase of this present time a
							Fellow-feeling. And therefore’ (he continues, another point of
							contact with Aristotle,) ‘for calamity arising from great
							wickedness the best men have the least pity; and for the same calamity
							those have pity that think themselves least obnoxious to the
							same.’ [Hobbes, as is well known, analysed Aristotle's treatise in
							his <hi rend="italic">Brief of the Art of Rhetorick</hi>, first printed

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ma=llon tou= de/ontos</foreign>,
								‘<hi rend="italic">too</hi> much’, (<hi rend="italic">ne

							opposition of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> and <foreign

							the difficulty is at once cleared up. Only <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>o)dunhra/</foreign> is repeated, which shews that the difference
							between this and <foreign xml:lang="greek">luphra/</foreign>
							is—here at all events— one of expression merely and not of

							Though they might be scattered over the whole speech, the proper place
							for them is the conclusion, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)pi/logos</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">peroratio</hi>, because

						<p>The importance of these to the rhetorician may be estimated by the fact

					<p>The subject of the following chapter, <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign>, an instinctive emotion,
						which approaches nearly to a virtue, and may therefore be included in a list

						together probably with some concluding observations leading up to the
						separate discussion of justice in Bk. V., and justifying its connexion with
						the other virtues and conformity to the law of the ‘mean’, which
						is barely mentioned in the fifth book as it stands at present. <foreign

							<foreign xml:lang="greek">o( nemeshtiko\s lupei=tai e)pi\ toi=s

							>e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> the defect, of indignation. Of this we shall
						have to speak further in the explanation of §§ 2—5, which

					<p>According to Aristotle's definition of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ne/mesis</foreign> ‘a feeling of pain at undeserved good
						fortune’, it represents the ‘righteous indignation’,
						arising from a sense of the claims of justice and desert, which is aroused
						in us by the contemplation of success without merit, and a consequent
						pleasure in the punishment of one who is thus undeservedly prosperous. It is
						no selfish feeling, § 3; if it had any reference to oneself and one's
						own interests it would be <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> of evil consequences
						arising to us from the other's prosperity, and not <hi rend="italic"
							>indignation.</hi> It implies also its opposite, the feeling of pleasure
						at deserved success or prosperity. In this narrow sense it is treated in the
						present chapter. It is in fact one form in which ‘moral
						disapprobation’, founded upon the distinction of right and wrong,
						shews itself in our nature. Aristotle, in classing it with the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, makes it <hi rend="italic"
							>instinctive;</hi> not therefore a virtue, nor necessarily requiring
						moral cultivation. Of moral approbation and disapprobation see the account
						given by Butler, at the commencement of his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation
							on the Nature of Virtue.</hi> He also seems to regard these two as
						natural instincts, when he says of them, “we naturally and unavoidably
						approve of some actions under the peculiar view of their being virtuous and
						of good desert; and disapprove others as vicious and of ill desert.”
						See also Serm. VIII. ‘On deliberate anger or resentment.’ Prof.
						Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, p. 321, [Chap. XV § 22,
						ed. 1875], in treating of ‘moral disapprobation’, expresses
						himself thus; “the feeling that rises up towards that person (a guilty
						agent) is a strong feeling of displeasure or dislike, proportioned to the
						strength of our regard to the violated duty. There arises a moral
						resentment, or a disposition to inflict punishment upon the offender,”
						&amp;c. But such an instinctive sense of right and wrong has a much wider
						scope and sphere of action than Aristotle's <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ne/mesis</foreign>, which is confined to one particular class of cases
						upon which this moral instinct or faculty operates. </p>

								>ste/rhsis</foreign> therefore in the present passage implies a loss

							gain or acquire it, is properly opposed to <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>u(pa/rxein</foreign>, to have it already in possession,

						<p>‘And therefore all these feelings (<foreign xml:lang="greek"

						<p>The introduction of these episodical remarks, §§ 3—5,
							upon the connexion and distinctions of the three <foreign

							to explain, may possibly be accounted for, as I have already suggested,
							by referring them to the statements of Eth. Nic. II 7, 1108 <hi
								rend="italic">b</hi> 4, which Ar. now sees must be retracted. There
							they are reduced to the law of the mean by making <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ne/mesis</foreign> the mean state of the pleasure
							and pain felt at our neighbour's good or ill fortune; of which <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign> is the excess, the pain being
							felt at all good fortune deserved or undeserved, and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> the defect ‘because
							the feeling falls so short of pain that it is actually pleasure’.
							The words of § 5, <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ e)/sti tou=
								h)/qous...o( ga\r au)to\s e)sti\n e)pixaire/kakos kai\ fqonero/s,
								k.t.l.</foreign> are, whether they are intended for it or not, a
							correction of the blunder made in the Ethics. It is plain enough, as we
							are here told in the Rhetoric, that the two <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qh</foreign> in question are but two different phases of the
							same <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> or mental disposition:
							the same man who feels pain at his neighbour's good fortune <pb n="113"
							/> will feel pleasure at his misfortunes, and the two cannot be opposed
							as extremes. Again, the description of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)pixairekaki/a</foreign> as a defect of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ne/mesis</foreign> and opposite of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>fqo/nos</foreign> cannot be sustained: the <hi rend="italic"

					</div>
					<div xml:id="b2c9s7" type="section" n="7">
						<p>‘The first of these is plain from what has been already said, for
							if righteous indignation is (as it has been defined) a feeling of pain

					<div xml:id="b2c9s8" type="section" n="8">
						<p>‘For no one is likely to feel indignant with one who becomes just,
							or brave, or acquires any virtue in general’, (that is, one who by
							exercise and cultivation attains to any special virtue, or to a virtuous
							character in general)—‘nor indeed is compassion’ (the
							plur. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/leoi</foreign> indicates the various
							acts, states, moments of the feeling) ‘bestowed upon (applied to)

						<p>So far the meaning is clear; the good as a general rule are entitled to
							the enjoyment of wealth and power and the like, and when they <hi
								rend="italic">do</hi> acquire them we feel no indignation because we
							know they deserve them; it is upon the undeserving that our indignation
							is bestowed. But as the text stands, and as far as I can see there is no
							other way of understanding it, there is another class of persons, viz.
							those who are endowed with natural or personal advantages, such as birth
							or beauty, which, being independent of themselves and mere gifts of
							nature, cannot be objects of moral indignation, though they may be of
							envy, who are coupled with the morally good as deserving <pb n="114"/>
							of wealth and power. This however cannot possibly be Aristotle's
							meaning: birth and beauty certainly have no claim <hi rend="italic">per
								se</hi> to any other advantages. When a bad man makes his way to
							wealth or power, we infer that they have been acquired by fraud or
							injustice, and thence that he is undeserving of them, which excites our
							indignation; but no such inference can be drawn from the possession of
							birth or beauty, there is no such thing as illicit, or undeserved
							possession of them. Aristotle seems to have meant, what Victorius
							attributes to him, that, besides moral excellence, <hi rend="italic"
								>natural</hi> gifts and excellences are also exempt from righteous
							indignation, for the reason above given—that they <hi
								rend="italic">are</hi> gifts of nature, and the possessors are in no
							way responsible for them: and this is fully confirmed by the connexion
							of what immediately follows. Bekker, Spengel, Buhle and the rest are
							alike silent upon the difficulty, and Victorius, though he puts what is
							probably the right interpretation upon the passage, has not one word to
							shew how such interpretation can be extracted from the received text.

								older form <foreign xml:lang="greek">mei/s, mi/a, me/n</foreign>, of

									xml:lang="greek">du/o</foreign> ‘two’; though as far
								as I know he stands alone in the opinion; the origin usually
								assigned to it being that it is a weaker form of <foreign
									xml:lang="greek">dh/</foreign>. Donaldson's view of the primary
								meaning and derivation of these particles is so completely in
								accordance with all their actual usages, and is so simple and
								natural, that it seems to me to carry with it its own evidence, and
								to need no further proof of its truth.</note>. The other particle,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)=n</foreign>, though its <pb n="117"/>
							precise meaning in this context may not be quite certain, and it is
							somewhat unusual in this collocation, is nevertheless fully justified by
							similar examples to be quoted immediately. The origin of the particle
							is, as it seems to me, as yet unexplained. It has been traced to various
							roots, as may be seen by consulting Donaldson, <hi rend="italic">New
								Cratylus</hi> § 189, Klotz on Devar. <hi rend="italic">de
								Partic.</hi> p. 717 seq., Hartung, <hi rend="italic">Partikell.</hi>
							II 8, Doderlein, and Rost, in Rost and Palm's <hi rend="italic"
								>Lex.</hi>, but in none of these derivations have I been able to
							find any intelligible connexion with the actual senses of the word. Yet
							until we know the root of the word and its affinities, we shall hardly
							be able to trace historically the various senses which diverge from its
							primary meaning. It is a connective particle, which draws an inference
							or conclusion from something preceding, ‘then, accordingly’,
							(1) logically in an argument, and (2) in the continuation of a
							narrative, the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> primarily implied
							having passed into the mere notion of what is <hi rend="italic"
								>subsequent</hi>, ‘that which <hi rend="italic"
							>follows</hi>’, in both its senses. Hence in all Greek authors
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> is habitually
							employed in this second sense, like the French ‘or’, and our
							‘now’ or ‘then’, to impart a slight degree of
							liveliness and animation to a continuous narrative or discussion. From
							the first or inferential signification, it acquires this intermediate
							sense of, ‘so then’, ‘well then’,
							‘accordingly’, which lies halfway between the logical and
							the temporal application; just like our ‘then’, which has
							both these senses, only derived in the reverse order, the particle of
							time in the English ‘then’, passing from the temporal to the
							logical use. For this <foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> at
							the commencement of a new paragraph the orators—Demosthenes in
							particular, with whom <foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign> is
							comparatively rare, Aeschines in a less degree—often substitute
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">toi/nun</foreign> or <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">me\n toi/nun</foreign>, which is used precisely in
							the same way. “<foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n ou)=n</foreign>, in
							continuando sermone cum quadam <hi rend="italic">conclusionis</hi>
							significatione usurpatur.” Hermann ad Viger. note 342. </p>
						<p>The other prevailing signification of <foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n
								ou)=n</foreign> when used in combination, which, though by no means
							confined to them, is found chiefly in dialogues as those of Plato and
							Aristophanes—in the former most frequently in the familiar
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/nu me\n ou)=n</foreign>—has a
							negative corrective sense conveying an emphatic assertion, sometimes to
							be rendered by a negative; being employed to correct, in the way of
							strengthening or heightening, a previous statement or assertion; and
							while it assents to a proposition indicates an advance beyond it. Dem.

							‘just so’, ‘quite so’, ‘exactly so’.
							In all these cases it may be rendered ‘<hi rend="italic"

							the same <pb n="118"/> sense it appears in the Aristophanic <foreign

							‘no, mine; no mine’, in answer to Cleon's nauseous offer to
							the Demus, Equit. 911; and elsewhere. <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/nu
								me\n ou)=n</foreign> is to be explained thus; I not only assent to
							what you say, but I go farther, I am absolutely convinced of it;
							‘nay more (or nay rather), absolutely so’. The <foreign

						are liable to the feeling, no wise man, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>fro/nimos</foreign>, is capable of it. This is in accordance with the

						is a mistake to confine the feeling to the good fortune of <hi rend="italic"

					<p>The Stoic definition, <foreign xml:lang="greek">lu/phn e)p' a)llotri/ois
							a)gaqoi=s</foreign>, Diog. Laert., Zeno, VII 111, which does not define
						the <hi rend="italic">objects</hi> of the feeling, seems to have been the
						prevailing form of it. It is repeated by Cicero as Zeno's with additions,
						Tusc. Disp. IV 8. 17, <hi rend="italic">Invidentiam esse dicunt</hi>
						(Stoici) <hi rend="italic">aegritudinem susceptam propter alterius res
							secundas, quae nihil noceant invidenti. Nam si quis doleat eius rebus
							secundis a quo ipse laedatur, non recte dicatur invidere; ut si Hectori
							Agamemno: qui autem cui alterius commoda nihil noceant tamen eum doleat
							his frui, is invidet profecto.</hi> This leaves the objects of the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> unlimited, which seems to be
						the true account of it. So Horace, Ep. I 2. 57, <hi rend="italic">Invidus
							alterius macrescit rebus opimis.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>I will conclude this note with two or three more modern definitions.
							“<hi rend="italic">Grief</hi> for the success of a competitor in
						wealth, honour, or other good, if it be joined with endeavour to enforce our
						own abilities to equal or exceed him, is called Emulation: but joined with
						endeavour to supplant or hinder a competitor, Envy.” Hobbes, <hi
							rend="italic">Leviathan</hi>, Of the Passions, Pt. 1, ch. 6. Envy and
						Emulation, <foreign xml:lang="greek">zh=los</foreign>, <hi rend="italic"
							>aemulatio</hi>, usually go together in a classification of the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, being evidently closely connected. See
						the passages in Diog. Laert. and Cic. above quoted; and so also Aristotle.
						This definition very nearly approaches to that of Ar., only omitting the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\ i(/na ti au)tw=|</foreign>. </p>
					<p>“Envy”, says Locke, <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, &amp;c., Bk.
						II. Ch. 20, <hi rend="italic">Of modes of pleasure and pain</hi>, “is
						an uneasiness of the mind, caused by the consideration of a good we desire,
						obtained by one we think should not have had it before us.” Here again
						the notion of ‘competition’ enters into the definition. </p>
					<p>Lastly, Bain, <hi rend="italic">Emotions and Will</hi>, Ch. VII, classes this
						under the general head of emotions of self, and connects it, like his
						predecessors, with Emulation, § 9 [p. 105, ed. 2, 1865]. Comparison and
						the desire of Superiority, lie at the bottom of both Emotions. “The
						feeling of <hi rend="italic">Envy</hi> is much more general in its
						application. Referring to everything that is desirable in the condition of
						some more fortunate personage, there is <pb n="123"/> combined a strong wish
						for the like good to self, with an element of malevolence towards the
						favoured party.” This differs from Aristotle in the introduction of
						the selfish and the malevolent elements, and removes the unnecessary
						restriction to cases of competition, by which he has limited its objects and
						scope. It is I believe a much truer and more philosophical account of the
						Emotion. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Envy, has some points in common with
						Aristotle. Bacon places the sting of envy in the want of something which
						another possesses. “A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth
						virtue in others. For men's minds will either feed upon their own good or
						upon others' evil; and who <hi rend="italic">wanteth</hi> the one will prey
						upon the other; and whoso is out of hope to attain to another's virtue will
						seek to come at even hand by depressing another's fortune.” This
						introduces Aristotle's principle of rivalry and competition as the
						foundation of envy. Again, with §§ 2 and 5, may be compared,
						“Lastly, near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been
						bred together, are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised. For
						it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes; and pointeth at them, and
						cometh oftener into their remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into the
						note of others: and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame.” This
						arises from their constant association, which gives frequent occasion to
						envy. “Again, envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man's self;
						and where there is no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are not
						envied but by kings;” compared with the end of § 5. </p>
					<div xml:id="b2c10s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>‘The occasions, objects, and mental dispositions, that give rise to

						<p>In reality envy is not <hi rend="italic">confined</hi>, as Aristotle
							seems to say, to these classes of people as objects; nor even to those
							with whom we are likely to come into competition; it seems rather that
							there is no limit, within the circle of humanity, to the objects on
							which it may be exercised. A man may envy a baby its innocence, its
							health, its rosy cheeks, or the poorest and meanest his health and
							strength: the feeling of pain which belongs to envy no doubt proceeds
							from an involuntary comparison of oneself with another, who <hi
								rend="italic">has</hi> some valuable possession which we happen to
								<hi rend="italic">want;</hi> and the unsatisfied desire, contrasted
							with the gratification of it in some one else, friend or foe, good or
							bad, high or low, in a malevolent disposition—not in the <hi
								rend="italic">wise</hi> man, as Socrates has it—breeds the
							feeling of pain. Aristotle's definition may be thus summed up: envy is a
							feeling of pain, excited, usually if not always, by the successful
							competition of a real or supposed rival. ‘Those also’ are
							disposed to it ‘who (have nearly attained to) want but little of
							complete satisfaction (of possessing every thing desirable)’. A
							long and uninterrupted course of success and prosperity, and the
							attainment of <hi rend="italic">nearly all</hi> that is desirable, seems
							to give them a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to what still remains
							deficient; and the envy which they would in any case feel of the
							possession of it by another, gains strength by the contrast with their
							own deficiency. Here again it is the competition and the comparison of
							our own condition with that of another, the want and the inferiority,
							that add a sting to envy. </p>

						<p>In this last section there are two or three points requiring
							consideration which it will be as well to dispatch before proceeding to
							the translation. The first is, whether we are to read <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)f' oi(=s</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>oi(=s</foreign> without the prepos.; and then, what do <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)f' oi(=s</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>oi(=s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
							ti/si</foreign>, severally represent. Spengel, following MS A^{c}
							retains <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)f' oi(=s</foreign>; Bekker in his
							third ed., for once departs from that MS and reads <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign>, although, as it seems, none of the
							MSS give any various reading. It seems therefore on this ground
							preferable to retain <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)f' oi(=s</foreign> if
							we can; and we have next to consider how it is to be interpreted, and
							how distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si. e)f'
								oi(=s</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign> are
							equally irregular after <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=lon</foreign> (see
							note on II 9. 11, at the end), and the grammar therefore throws no light
							upon the reading. As far as the grammar and interpretation are concerned
							there seems to be no objection to retaining <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)pi/</foreign>. </p>
						<p>We have then to decide whether <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=s</foreign>
							or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> stands for persons or
							things; either of which is possible. However if the choice is to be made
							between them, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> seems the more
							natural representative of persons, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>oi(=s</foreign> of things; and so in general, throughout these
							analyses of the feelings, Aristotle is accustomed to designate the <hi
								rend="italic">persons</hi> who are the objects of them by the
							pronoun <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/nes</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Thirdly, there is no objection to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si
								xai/rousin</foreign> in the sense of ‘<hi rend="italic"
								>at</hi>’ or ‘by whom they are pleased’ (lit. <hi
								rend="italic">upon</hi> whom their pleasure is bestowed or
							directed), ‘in whom they find pleasure’, though the bare
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/si</foreign> is more usual (possibly
							this may be Bekker's reason for his alteration [of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)f' oi(=s</foreign>]); and if there were any doubt
							about it, it would be sufficiently supported by <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois</foreign> (what sort of <hi
								rend="italic">persons</hi>) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>xai/rein</foreign>, c. 9. 16. Consequently, as I can see no
							sufficient reason for altering the text contrary to all manuscript
							authority, I have retained <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)f'
								oi(=s</foreign>, understanding it of <hi rend="italic">things</hi>,
							the occasions of joy or delight; and <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
								ti/si</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> who excite the
							feeling in us. <pb n="130"/>
						</p>
						<p>The next clause, <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s ga\r ou)k e)/xontes
								lupou=ntai, k.t.l.</foreign> presents some difficulty, and Muretus
							and the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Translatio</hi>, followed by Schrader
							and Wolf, reject the negative <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k</foreign>
							(or <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh/</foreign> as it stood in the MSS
							employed in the older editions). This however would make the two
							opposite feelings of pleasure and pain the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>
							state or disposition of mind, which I think could not possibly have been
							Aristotle's meaning. Victorius takes what I believe to be the right view
							on the point. The meaning will then be, that the negative, the
							contradictory, of pain, i. e. pleasure (the two never co-existing), is
							excited by the opposite circumstances to those which are productive of
							the pain of envy; if pain under particular circumstances is excited by
							the sight of the good fortune of another, substitute the opposite, ill
							fortune for good fortune in each case, and you will have the appropriate
							topics for giving rise to the feeling of pleasure in your audience.
							This, says Victorius, is <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)pixairekaki/a</foreign>, wanton malice, malevolent pleasure in
							the misfortunes of others. The above interpretation is at all events
							free from the objection to which Schrader's is liable, namely that it
							makes Aristotle say that the same mental state or disposition is painful
							and pleasurable. The choice between the two depends mainly upon the
							interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( toiou=toi</foreign> and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pw=s e)/xontes</foreign>. I understand by
							the former the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fqoneroi/</foreign>, the common
							character of all the classes distinguished in the analysis; Schrader of
							the members of the several classes, the ambitious, the prosperous and
							successful; and in his view these classes must fall under the several
							‘states of mind’ designated by <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pw=s, w(s, ou(/tws, e)/xontes</foreign>, such as ambition; though
							how it can be applied to others, such as ‘the prosperous and
							successful’, his second instance, he does not inform us. If by the
							‘state of mind’ the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qos</foreign> or emotion is meant<note anchored="true">This is
								certainly so. Take, for instance, the first words of the following
								chapter, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pw=s d' e)/xontes
									zhlou=si</foreign>, the state of mind in which <foreign
									xml:lang="greek">zh=los</foreign> is shewn, or resides: which
								identifies <foreign xml:lang="greek">zh=los</foreign> with the <hi
									rend="italic">state</hi> in question.</note> (which seems to be
							Spengel's view), it is quite impossible that two such states, one
							pleasurable and the other painful, can be the same. Schrader, however,
							appears to take the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pw=s e)/xein</foreign> in
							a different sense, for the character or habit of mind, the mental
							constitution, which tends to produce such and such feelings; and in this
							point of view, though ambition (his first instance) may fairly enough be
							called a disposition of mind, yet I cannot see how the second, the
							prosperous and successful men, or prosperity and success, can well be
							included in the designation. </p>
						<p>In conclusion I will transcribe part of his note, that the reader may
							have the opportunity of deciding for himself; merely adding that
							manuscript and editorial authority is against his omission of the
							negative, and that though his interpretation is very plausible at first
							sight, I doubt whether it can be right, for the reasons stated.

						the pain of emulation springs from the sense of our own deficiencies and the
						desire of rising to a higher level of virtue or honour: consequently the one
						is a virtuous, the other a vicious, feeling; emulation leads to
						self-improvement, and the practice of virtue; the object of envy is nothing
						but the degradation or injury of another: or, as Aristotle expresses it,
						emulation aims at the acquisition of good things, envy at <pb n="132"/> the
						deprivation of them in another, the infliction of harm and loss on one's
						neighbour. </p>
					<p>Such is Aristotle's account of emulation; according to him the feeling is
						one, and that virtuous. The Stoics however, as interpreted by Cicero, Tusc.
						Disp. IV 8. 17, distinguished two kinds of <hi rend="italic"
							>aemulatio:—ut et in laude et in vitio nomen hoc sit. Nam et
							imitatio virtutis aemulatio dicitur: et est aemulatio aegritudo, si eo
							quod concupierit alius potiatur ipse careat.</hi> And again, c. 26. 56,
							<hi rend="italic">aemulantis, angi alieno bono quod ipse non
							habeat.</hi> The two definitions differ also in this, that in Ar.'s all
						emulation is painful and all virtuous; in that of the Stoics, one form of it
						is virtuous but not painful, the other painful but not virtuous; and in fact
						it is difficult to distinguish the latter form of it from envy. </p>
					<p>The Stoic definition of Zeno and (apparently) Chrysippus, Diog. Laert., Zeno,
						VII 111, gives only the painful and vicious form of <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">zh=los, lu/phn e)pi\ tw=| a)/llw| parei=nai w(=n
							au)to\s e)piqumei=</foreign>. Cicero attributes his double definition
						also to Zeno. </p>
					<p>Hobbes' and Bain's definitions of the affection I have already quoted in the
						introductory note to Ch. X. Locke, in the chapter there referred to, does
						not include emulation in his list of ‘Passions’, or ‘Modes
						of pleasure and pain’. </p>
					<p>Stewart, <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Moral Philosophy</hi>, Pt. II. Sect.
						III. 5, has some remarks upon emulation, which he classes with the desires,
						and not (as Aristotle and others) with the affections. “It is the
						desire of superiority which is the active principle; and the malevolent
						affection is only a concomitant circumstance.” Here he is in
						accordance with Aristotle. “When emulation is accompanied with
						malevolent affection, it assumes the name of envy.” </p>
					<p>“Emulation,” says Butler, <hi rend="italic">Sermon I.</hi>, On
						Human Nature, note 4, “is merely the desire and hope of equality with,
						or superiority over others, with whom we compare ourselves. There does not
						appear to be <hi rend="italic">any other grief</hi> in the natural passion,
						but only <hi rend="italic">that want</hi> which is implied in desire.
						However, this may be so strong as to be the occasion of great <hi
							rend="italic">grief.</hi> To desire the attainment of this equality or
						superiority by the <hi rend="italic">particular means</hi> of others being
						brought down to our own level or below it, is, I think, the distinct notion
						of envy. From whence it is easy to see that the real end which the natural
						passion, emulation, and which the unlawful one, envy, aims at, is exactly
						the same; namely that equality or superiority; and consequently, that to do
						mischief is not the object of envy, but merely the means it makes use of to
						attain its end.” At all events, the malevolent <hi rend="italic"
							>feeling</hi> is a constituent element of the emotion of envy, without
						which it would not be what it is: though the actual <hi rend="italic">doing
							mischief</hi> may not be essential to it. </p>
					<p>1. ‘The dispositions of emulation (the states of mind which exhibit it,
						in which it resides), its occasions and objects, will be clear from what
						follows’. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ poi=a</foreign> here stands
						for ‘the sort of things’ which excite emu<pb n="133"/> lation,
						usually expressed in these analyses by <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
							poi/ois</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ ti/si</foreign> for
						the ‘persons’ or ‘objects’, <hi rend="italic"
							>upon</hi> whom it lights, i.e. against whom it is directed, which again
						is more usually conveyed by the simple <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ti/si</foreign>. See however c. 10 § 11, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>e)pi\ ti/si</foreign>, and the note there; and <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ poi/ois xai/rein</foreign> c. 9 § 16.
						‘If, namely, emulation is a feeling of pain on the occasion of the
						manifest (unmistakable) presence of good things, highly valued and possible
						for ourselves to acquire, (<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri/</foreign> in
						respect of, in the case of, i.e.) belonging to, or acquired by, those who
						have a natural resemblance to ourselves (in temper, faculties, powers, gifts
						and accomplishments natural or acquired, or anything which brings them <hi
							rend="italic">into contrast</hi> with us); not because another has them
						(which is envy) but because we ourselves have them not (and so, feeling the
							<hi rend="italic">want</hi>, are anxious to obtain them, in order to
						raise ourselves to the level of our assumed rival)— and accordingly,
						(the latter,) emulation is virtuous and a property of virtuous men, envy on
						the other hand vicious and of the vicious: for whilst the one is led by his
						emulation to procure (contrive, manage) for himself the attainment of these
						goods, the other is led by his envy to manage merely that his neighbour
						shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have them’:—(This is mere
						malevolence, the desire of harm or loss to another, without any
						corresponding advantage to oneself. The sentence from <foreign

							>muqogra/foi</foreign>” (this early history was often of a
							mythical and legendary character), “denique orationum
							panegyricarum auctores hoc ambiguo vocabulo significantur.” (The
							later, and most usual, meaning of the word is here omitted.) As this was
							for some time the only prose literature in existence, the <foreign

							the poets, so as to signify ‘prose writers’ in general. And

						<p>The later and commoner signification, which appears so frequently in the

							compared with Plato's horror, expressed in the Phaedrus, of making a
							trade of teaching), and <foreign xml:lang="greek">logogra/fos</foreign>
							became a term of reproach. Perhaps the earliest example of this

						proof or instrument of persuasion, to assist the cogency of the logical
						arguments. This occupies the six following chapters from 12 to 17; in which
						the salient features or characteristics of the three ages, youth, old age,
						and manhood or the prime of life; and of the three social conditions of
						noble birth or family, wealth, and power, are set forth in detail. The
						import of these chapters, and their connexion with the main subject of the
						entire work, which explains and justifies their position here, has been
						already treated in the Introduction, pp. 110—112, to which the reader
						is referred. The study of these ‘characters’ will enable the
						speaker to accommodate his language and arguments to their several tastes
						and dispositions. </p>
					<p>The four stages of human life, as described by Horace, Epist. ad Pis. 156
						seq., have much more in common with Shakespeare's ‘seven ages’,
							(<hi rend="italic">As you like it</hi>, Act II. sc. 7 [lines
						143—166],) than with Aristotle's analysis. Horace writes with a view
						to the use of the <hi rend="italic">poet</hi>, and describes them as they
						should appear in the drama or the Epic poem: his cha<pb n="139"/> racters
						are the <hi rend="italic">dramatic characters</hi>: Aristotle writing for
						the rhetorician applies his analysis to the purposes of <hi rend="italic"
							>argument;</hi> reserving the dramatic expression of character for the
						third book, where it naturally falls under the treatment of style and
						expression. Horace's object appears in the lines, <hi rend="italic">Ne forte
							seniles mandentur iuveni partes pueroque viriles, semper in adiunctis
							aevoque morabimur aptis</hi> [176]. </p>
					<p>Bacon's <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>, Of Youth and Age [XLII], is too well
						known to need more than a mere reference. Two such observers as Aristotle
						and Bacon must of course agree in the general outline of the two contrasted
						characters; but Bacon's is a brief sketch, presenting the leading features
						of both more particularly as they exhibit themselves in the conduct and
						management of business, and in public life: Aristotle fills in the details
						of the picture in a much more complete and comprehensive analysis. </p>
					<p>Plutarch, in the treatise <hi rend="italic">de virtute morali</hi>, c. XI,
						discussing the moral constitution of the human subject, illustrates his
						material theory of the origin of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pa/qh</foreign> by reference to the characters of the young and old,
						which he thus describes; <foreign xml:lang="greek">dio\ ne/oi me\n kai\
							o)cei=s kai\ i)tamoi\</foreign> (headlong, hasty, precipitate,) <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">peri/ te ta\s o)re/ceis dia/puroi kai\ oi)strw/deis

						authors' description of the hot impetuosity of the one and the cold
						phlegmatic temper of the other, is accounted for by similarity of theory as
						to the origin of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. With both
						the explanation is physiological, and in the spirit of modern inquiries in
						the same department. Aristotle's views may be gathered from the de Anima I
						1, 403 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3, seq. He there describes them as
						inseparable from the body and its matter and functions; with the possible
						exception of <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ noei=n</foreign> ‘thought
						and intelligence’, which is there included with the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> as a property of ‘life’;
						and they are ranked with sensation in general: <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>fai/netai de\ tw=n me\n plei/stwn</foreign>—the independent
						existence of the intellect, or part of it, being left an open

					<p>Against Spengel's view of these <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							tw=| le/gonti</foreign>, taken by Aristotle out of the order of
						treatment, which he had originally laid down for the three great divi<pb

							h)=qos, pa/qos</foreign>; and placed after, instead of before, the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>—I will here add to what
						I have already said in the Introd. p. 112 (and p. 110 on the real difference
						between the two kinds of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>
						described in II 1 and here), that, whereas in II 1 reference is made for
						details to the analysis of the virtues in I 9, the <hi rend="italic"
							>political</hi> characters of I 8, and the characters of the three ages
						and conditions of life, are not noticed at all; and for the best of reasons;
						because they in fact belong to a different class of <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>; the object of the first, <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> proper, being to impress the audience
						favourably as to your own character and good intentions; that of the second
						to adapt your tone, sentiments and language, to the tastes and feelings of
						certain special classes whom you may have to address; you study their
						‘characters’ for the purpose of introducing into your speech
						what you know will be acceptable to each of them. And precisely the same

						<p>Vater raises a difficulty about the connexion of the above passage with
							the concluding sentence of the last chapter, which he says he cannot
							understand. “How could Aristotle after stating that he had
							concluded the description of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qh</foreign> immediately add, as though nothing had been said
							about them, <hi rend="italic">nunc autem qui mores aut animorum motus
								—explicemus</hi>”<hi rend="italic">?</hi> My answer is
							that he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> say so: the two sentences have
							reference to two totally different things: at the end of c. 11, he tells
							us that he has now finished the analysis of the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>, and shews by the analysis how they
							can be applied to the purposes of the rhetorician, how to excite and
							allay them. What he says at the opening of c. 12, is that he is now
							going to treat of the application of these <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pa/qh</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/ceis</foreign>
							which grow out of them to the characters of certain ages and conditions
							of life. The Latin words quoted are a mere mistranslation: the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">kata/</foreign> is overlooked, and the sentence
							rendered as if it were <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ de\ h)/qh kai\ ta\
								pa/qh ...die/lqwmen</foreign>. Vater accordingly on this ground, and
							also on that of the passage of Quintilian (immediately to be noticed),
							supposes that something is lost here. </p>
						<p>The passage of Quintilian, V 10. 17, presents a <hi rend="italic"
								>real</hi> difficulty. In referring to Aristotle <hi rend="italic"
								>in secundo de Arte Rhetorica libro</hi>—which can only <pb
								n="141"/> mean this place—he adds to what we actually find in
							Aristotle several other ‘characters’ of which no trace is
							now to be found in his text, “<hi rend="italic">ut</hi> divitias
								<hi rend="italic">quid sequatur, aut</hi> ambitum, <hi rend="italic"
								>aut</hi> superstitionem; <hi rend="italic">quid boni probent, quid
								mali petant, quid</hi> milites, <hi rend="italic">quid rustici; quo
								quaeque modo res vitari vel appeti soleat.</hi>” Both
							Victorius (Comm. ad II 17. 6, p. 358, ed. 1548), and Spalding (ad loc.
							Quint.), attribute the discrepancy to a lapse of memory on Quintilian's
							part, who was here quoting without book. The former, in a sarcastic
							note, thinks that it is much more probable to suppose that Quintilian,
							without referring to the text of his author, added <hi rend="italic">de
								suo</hi> what he thought <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be there,
							than that anything has been lost in a book which presents no trace of
							any hiatus. To which Spalding adds, “non uno quidem loco vidimus
							videbimusque Quintilianum memoriae vitio e libris afferentem, quae in
							iis non plane eadem legerentur. Cf. IV 2. 132.” In this
							explanation I think we must acquiesce. Spengel also, in his tract <hi
								rend="italic">über die Rhet. des Ar.</hi> (Trans. Bav. Acad.
							1851) p. 43, attributes this want of coincidence to a
							‘mistake’ of Quintilian. </p>

							at 37 ‘or thereabouts’; neither of them divisible by seven;

							of human life is again fixed at 70 years. So the Psalmist [xc. 10],
							“The days of our years are threescore years and ten.” </p>
						<p>And to the same theory (the number seven, marking a crisis, or stage of
							growth, in the life of an animal,) reference is frequently made, in the
							Hist. Anim., as VII 1. 2, 16, 18, c. 12. 2, and elsewhere: from all
							which it may be concluded that Aristotle was a believer in it. Plato,
							Rep. V 460 E, fixes the prime of life in a woman at the age of 20, in a
							man at 30: in Legg. IV 721 A, and in three other places, the age of
							marriage is fixed from 30 to 35, though in one of them (VI 772 E) 25 is
							also named. Compare on this subject Hes. Opp. et D. 695 seq. Xenoph. de
							Rep. Lac. I 6, (Stallbaum's note on Plato l c). </p>
						<p>But the theory of the virtues of the number seven was carried to a far
							greater extent, as may be seen in I 6 of Macrobius' Commentary on
							Cicero's <hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi>, of which the sum is
							given in a quotation from the <hi rend="italic">Somnium
								Scipionis:—Cicero de septenario dicit, Qui numerus rerum
								omnium fere nodus est.</hi> Everything in nature is determined by
							the number seven. Near the end of the chapter, we are told, in

								rend="italic">facit aetatem quae proprie perfecta et habetur et

				<div xml:id="b2c18" type="chapter" n="18">

					<p>The following chapter marks a division of the general subject of the work,
						and a stage or landing-place, from which we look back to what has been
						already done, and forwards to what still remains to do. The evident
						intention of the writer is to give a summary statement of the entire plan,
						and the main division of his system of Rhetoric, contained in the first two
						books, which comprise all the intellectual part, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ta\ peri\ th\n dia/noian</foreign>, II 26. 5, all that depends on
						argument; as opposed to the non-essential and ornamental part, style,
						action, and arrangement, treated in Bk. III. And it may fairly be supposed
						that it was also his intention to arrange these divisions in the same order
						as that which he proposed to follow in the actual treatment of the subject. </p>
					<p>But in the text, at any rate of the first half of the chapter, to <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">poihte/on</foreign>, this order is not observed; and
						there is altogether so much irregularity and confusion in the structure of
						the sentences, and such a mixture of heterogeneous subjects, that it seems
						tolerably certain that we have not this portion of the chapter in the form
						in which Aristotle wrote it. First, the long parenthesis about the
						applicability of the terms <foreign xml:lang="greek">kri/sis</foreign> or
						decision, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kri/ths</foreign>, <hi rend="italic"
							>judge</hi> or critic, to all the three branches of Rhetoric, has no
						natural connexion with the context—though at the same time it is quite
						true that the use of the parenthesis, <hi rend="italic">a note</hi> inserted
						in the <hi rend="italic">text</hi>, is a marked feature of Aristotle's
						ordinary style: still this would be an exaggeration, or abuse of the
						peculiarity. Spengel has pointed out (<hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav.
							Acad.</hi> 1851, p. 35), that the whole of this parenthesis, <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">e)/sti de/—bouleu/ontai</foreign> [p. 175, line
						2, to p. 176, last line], is nothing but an expansion of a preceding
						passage, <pb n="172"/> I 1. 2, the same notion being here carried out into
						detail. But although it is so much out of place that it is hardly
						conceivable that even Aristotle (whose style is not remarkable for its close
						connexion—is in fact often rather rambling and incoherent) should have
						introduced it here, as part of an enormous protasis of which the apodosis or
						conclusion relates to something entirely different; yet as it bears all the
						characteristic marks of the author's style, including the irregularity and
						the heaping of parenthesis upon parenthesis, though it was most probably not
						written for this place, there is no reason to doubt that it proceeds from
						the pen of Aristotle. </p>
					<p>The parenthesis ends at <foreign xml:lang="greek">bouleu/ontai</foreign>, and
						we ought now to resume the interrupted <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pro/tasis</foreign>. This appears, according to the ordinary
						punctuation, (with the full stop at <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pro/teron</foreign>,) to be carried on as far as <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>, the conclusion or apodosis being
						introduced by <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>, as usual. The
						grammar <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pei/...w(/ste</foreign> is no objection
						to this, since we have already seen (note on II 9. 11) that Aristotle is
						often guilty of this, and even greater grammatical irregularities. But the
						sense shews that the passage when thus read cannot be sound. There is no
						real conclusion; for it by no means follows that, because ‘the
						employment of all persuasive speeches is directed to a <hi rend="italic"
							>decision</hi> of some kind’, and because (second member of
						protasis) ‘the political characters’ have been described (in I
						8), ‘<hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> it has been determined how and
						by what means or materials speeches may be invested with an ethical
						character’. In fact it is a complete <hi rend="italic"
							>non-sequitur.</hi>
					</p>
					<p>Bekker [ed. 3] and Spengel, in order to establish a connexion between
						protasis and apodosis, put a comma at <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pro/teron</foreign>; suppose that the preceding sentence from the
						beginning of the chapter is left incomplete, without apodosis, at <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">bouleu/ontai</foreign>; and that <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> marks the conclusion <hi rend="italic"
							>only</hi> from the clause immediately preceding; the meaning then
						being, that the description of the ‘political characters’ in I 8
						is a sufficient determination of the modes of imparting an ethical character
						to the speech. But this cannot be right: for not only is the fact alleged
						quite insufficient in itself to support the conclusion supposed to be
						deduced from it, but also the two kinds of characters designated are in fact
						different; and it could not be argued from the mere description of the
						characters of I 8, that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=|
							le/gonti</foreign> had been sufficiently discussed and determined; which
						is in fact done—so far as it is done at all—in II 1, and not in
						I 8. </p>
					<p>Other proposed alterations and suggested difficulties in the rest of the
						chapter may be left for discussion to their place in the Commentary: the
						meaning and connexion of this part are in general perfectly intelligible,
						though omission, interpolation, and obscurity or error are alleged against
						this and that phrase; and the order of the actual contents of the work
						coincides essentially and in the main with that which is here followed. </p>
					<p>I have now to state the views of two recent critics and commentators upon the
						whole passage, in its connexion with the order of the several divisions of
						the entire work. </p>
					<p>Spengel's views upon this subject are to be found in his tract <hi
							rend="italic">über die Rhetorik des Arist.</hi>, in the <hi
							rend="italic">Transactions of the Bav. Acad.</hi> 1851, <pb n="173"/>
						pp. 32—37; a work which I have already had frequent occasion to refer
						to. He had previously spoken of the order contemplated and adopted by
						Aristotle, in the arrangement of the three main divisions of his subject;
						the analysis of the direct proofs, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pi/steis</foreign>, by logical argument, and the two modes of indirect
						confirmation of the others, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>,
						and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. The passages which he
						himself quotes in illustration of the first order in which Aristotle
						proposes to take them, pp. 25—27, shew that the order is <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pi/steis, h)/qh, pa/qh</foreign>: nevertheless Spengel
						inverts the two last, p. 30 et seq., omitting the actual treatment of the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, as a <hi rend="italic"
							>subsidiary argument</hi> or mode of persuasion in II 1, the true
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos e)n tw=| le/gonti</foreign>; and, as it
						seems to me, confounding that with a totally different set of characters,
						which are delineated as an appendix to the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pa/qh</foreign>, and consequently <hi rend="italic">after</hi> them in
						II 12—17. This I have already pointed out, and explained the real
						application of the six characters of II 12—17 to the purposes of
						Rhetoric, in the Introduction p. 110, foll. and at the commencement of c. 12
						in the Commentary. Spengel notices the inconclusive <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> in the apodosis, c. 18. 1 (p. 34),
						apparently assuming that the passage is corrupt, but throws no further light
						upon the interpretation or means of correcting the section. Next we have, p.
						36 foll., an attempt to prove that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\
							loipa/</foreign>, in § 5, is to be understood of the treatment of
						the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>h)=qos</foreign> contained severally in c. 2—11 and 12—17
						of Bk. II, and that consequently from the words <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>o(/pws ta\ loipa\ prosqe/ntes a)podw=men th\n e)c a)rxh=s
							pro/qesin</foreign> we are to conclude that the order of treatment of
						the contents of the first two books was as follows; the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">pi/steis
							e)c au)tou= tou= lo/gou</foreign> (as if the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>h)=qos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> were
						not equally conveyed <hi rend="italic">by the speech itself</hi>), occupying
						the first book; next, the four <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi\
							to/poi</foreign>, and the second part of the logical <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>, II 18—26; and thirdly, the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>h)=qos</foreign> in the first seventeen chapters of Bk. II, which
						originally formed the conclusion of that book, though now the order of the
						two parts is inverted. </p>
					<p>Vahlen, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Vienna Acad.
							of Sciences</hi>, Oct. 1861, pp. 59—148, has gone at some length
						into the questions that arise out of this eighteenth chapter, where it is
						compared with other passages in which Aristotle has indicated the order in
						which he meant to treat the several divisions of his subject. Op. cit.
						121—132. His principal object in writing, he says, p. 122, is to
						defend against Brandis' criticisms Spengel's view that the original
						arrangement of Aristotle in treating the subjects of the second book has
						been subsequently inverted in the order in which they now stand; Aristotle
						having intended to complete the survey of the logical department of Rhetoric
						before he entered upon the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign>. He is of opinion (p. 126)
						that the analysis of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>
						came next (in accordance with the original plan) to the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> of the first book; and consequently
						that there is a gap at the opening of the second between the conclusion of
						the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> and the commencement of the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>pa/qh</foreign>; and that as a further consequence, the words in §
						2, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti d' e)c w(=n
							h)qikou/s—diw/ristai</foreign>, are an interpolation of some
						editor of Aristotle's work, who introduced them, <hi rend="italic">after
							the</hi>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>
						<hi rend="italic">had been transferred to their present place</hi>, as a
						necessary recognition of what had actually been done. His principal object
						is in fact to establish what he conceives to be the true order of the
						several parts of <pb n="174"/> the work; and in doing so he deals, as it
						seems to me, in the most arbitrary manner with Aristotle's text. He assumes
						a Redactor, or Editor, who has taken various liberties with the text of his
						author, and has interpolated various passages, chiefly relating to the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>, to supply what he conceived
						to be deficient after the order had been changed. How or why the order was
						changed, neither he nor Spengel gives us any indication; and the supposition
						of these repeated interpolations has little or no foundation except his own
						hypothesis of the inseparable connexion of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ei)/dh</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi\
						to/poi</foreign>: for my own part I cannot find in the passages which he
						quotes in support of this opinion, or elsewhere in Aristotle's Rhetoric, any
						statement of a necessary connexion between the two, such as to make it
						imperative that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi\ to/poi</foreign>
						should be treated immediately after the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>ei)/dh</foreign>. The order of treatment which we find in the received
						text appears to be sufficiently natural and regular to defend it— in
						default of the strongest evidence to the contrary—against the
						suspicion of dislocation and interpolation, though no doubt the order
						suggested by Vahlen may be, considered in itself, more strictly logical and
						consecutive. On the connexion of the clauses of the passage now under
						consideration (c. 18 § 1), and how and why the long inappropriate
						parenthesis was introduced <hi rend="italic">here</hi>—which are,
						after all, the things that most require explanation—he leaves us as
						much in the dark as his predecessor Spengel. His interpretation of <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">ta\ loipa/</foreign> (which Spengel seems to have
						misunderstood), and anything else that requires notice, may be left for the
						notes on the passages to which they belong. </p>
					<p>I have suggested in the Introduction, p. 250, the possibility of the
						accidental omission of some words or sentences between <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">ei)/rhtai pro/teron</foreign> and <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">w(/ste diwrisme/non</foreign>, in order to supply some
						connexion between protasis and apodosis, and give some significance to the
						conclusion; but without any great confidence in the success of the attempt
						to solve the difficulty: to which I am bound to add that it leaves
						unexplained the introduction of the parenthesis, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>e)/sti de/—bouleu/ontai</foreign>, which, however and
						whencesoever it may have been introduced, is here most certainly out of
						place. And I will now proceed to give a summary of the contents of the
						chapter, as I understand them. </p>
					<p>All speeches which have persuasion for their object are addressed to, or look
						to, a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> of some kind. In the two more
						important branches of Rhetoric, the deliberative and forensic, <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">e)n toi=s politikoi=s a)gw=sin</foreign>, the <hi
							rend="italic">decision</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">judge</hi> may be
						understood literally: in the third or epideictic branch, the audience is in
						some sense also a judge, in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">critic</hi>,
						being called upon to <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> or pass sentence on the
						merits of the composition. Still it is only in the first two that the term
						‘judge’ can be applied to the hearer in its absolute, or strict
						and proper sense (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a(plw=s krith/s</foreign>).
						Then, as a second member of the protasis, comes a clause which has the
						appearance of being a continuation or supplement of something which has been
						lost—a reference, namely, to the treatment of the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> in II 1, which might justify the
						conclusion that follows, that ‘it has now been determined in what way
						and by what means speeches may be made to assume an ethical
						character’. Still the sentence and its statements remain incomplete:
						for if, as it appears, Aristotle's intention was to give an enumeration in
						detail of the main divisions of his Rhetoric <pb n="175"/> in the order in
						which he had placed them, the omission of the important department of the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> would be quite unaccountable,
						unless indeed— which I am myself inclined to believe—he meant to
						include the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> under the general head
						of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)qikoi\ lo/goi</foreign>; which, as the
						treatment of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/qh</foreign> belongs to
						Ethics, and the effects of the use of them by the speaker are purely
						ethical, he was fairly entitled to do. At the same time, if this be
						admitted, the <hi rend="italic">first part</hi> of the protasis with the
						parenthesis appended has no sufficient connexion with the conclusive
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>: nor is it clear why the
						‘political characters’, which do not come under the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign> proper, should be especially singled
						out as one at least of its representatives: though, if I am right in
						supposing something to be lost which stood before this clause, it might very
						likely have contained something which led to the mention of these
						characters, as one of the varieties of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>h)=qos</foreign> which impart an ethical colour to the speech. </p>
					<p>However, let us suppose at least, as we fairly may, that Aristotle's
						intention, however frustrated by corruption of his manuscript, was to tell
						us what he had already done from the commencement of the second book, and
						what he next proposed to do in the remainder of it. He has hitherto been
						employed (in this book) upon the Ethical branches of the art, by which the
						character of the speaker himself may be displayed in a favourable light, and
						the emotions of the audience directed into a channel favourable to the
						designs of the orator, § 1. </p>
					<p>We now take a fresh start, and from a new protasis, which states that the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign>, from which the statesman and
						public speaker, the pleader, and the declaimer, may derive their premisses
						and proofs, have been analysed under these three branches of Rhetoric, and
						also the materials, which may serve for imparting an ethical colour (in two
						senses, as before) to the speech, have been already despatched and
						determined, we arrive at the conclusion that it is now time to enter upon
						the subject of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinoi/</foreign> or universal
						topics—three in number as they are here classified, the possible and
						impossible, the past and the future, and amplification or exaggeration and
						depreciation—which comes next in order; and is accordingly treated in
						the following chapter. When this has been settled, we must endeavour to find
						something to say about <hi rend="italic">enthymemes</hi> in general,
						arguments which may be applied to all the branches of Rhetoric alike, and
							<hi rend="italic">examples</hi>, the two great departments of rhetorical
						reasoning or proof, ‘that by the addition of what still remained to be
						done’ (that is, by the completion of the logical division of the
						subject, by the discussion of enthymemes and examples, c. 20, the enthymeme
						including the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign>, c. 21, the

							when the one state is actually present, and <hi rend="italic"

							contraries belong to the same <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or class.
							Black and white both fall under the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> colour,
							of which they are the extremes; they pass from one into the other by
							insensible gradations of infinite variety, from which we may infer that

					<div xml:id="b2c19s2" type="section" n="2">
						<p>Again, likeness or resemblance, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
								o(/moion</foreign>, between two things suggests or implies a common
							possibility; if one thing can be done, the probability is that anything
							else <hi rend="italic">like it</hi> can be done equally. </p>
						<p>This is a variety of the argument from <hi rend="italic">analogy.</hi> We
							have a tendency, which appears to be natural and instinctive, to infer
							from any manifest or apparent resemblance between two objects, that is,
							from certain properties or attributes which they are seen or known to
							possess in common, the common possession of other properties and
							attributes, which are not otherwise known to belong to them, whereby we
							are induced to refer them to the same class. So here, the likeness of
							two things in certain respects, is thought to imply something different,
							which is also common to both; a common capacity or possibility. The
							argument being here applied solely to the use of Rhetoric, the things in
							question are rather actions and their consequences than facts and
							objects: if it has been found possible to effect something, to gain some
							political advantage for instance, in several previous cases, we argue
							that in the similar, parallel case which is under consideration, the
							like possibility may be expected. </p>
						<p>This however, though the popular view of the argument from analogy, and
							the ordinary mode of applying it, is not, strictly speaking, the right
							application of the term. Analogy, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
								a)na/logon</foreign>, is arithmetical or geometrical proportion, and
							represents a similarity, not between objects themselves, but between the
							relations of them. See Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lect. on
								Logic</hi>, Vol. 11. p. 165—174, Lect. XXXII, and on this
							point, p. 170. Whately (<hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> p. 74, c. 1),
							“Analogy, being a resemblance of ratios, that should strictly be
							called an argument from analogy, in which the two cases (viz. the one
								<hi rend="italic">from</hi> which, and the one <hi rend="italic"
								>to</hi> which we argue) are not themselves alike, but stand in a
							similar <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> to something else; or, in other
							words, that the common genus that they both fall under, consists <pb
								n="181"/> in a relation.” This he illustrates by two examples
							of analogical reasoning. One of them is, the inferences that may be
							drawn as to mental qualities and the changes they undergo, from similar
							changes (i.e. relations) in the physical constitution—though of
							course there can be no direct resemblance between them. Hamilton's
							illustration of analogy proper is derived directly from a numerical
							proportion: that of analogy in its popular usage is, “This disease
							corresponds in many symptoms with those we have observed in typhus
							fevers; it will therefore correspond in all, that is, it is a typhus
							fever,” p. 171. </p>
						<p>Buther's <hi rend="italic">Analogy of Natural and Revealed Religion to
								the constitution and course of Nature</hi> may be regarded as an
							analogy of relations between them and God the author of both, in the
							proper sense of the word, though in his Introduction he twice appears to
							identify analogy with mere likeness or similarity. </p>
						<p>Lastly, the logical description of Analogy is to be found in Thomson's
								<hi rend="italic">Law of Thought</hi>, § 121, ‘Syllogism
							of Analogy’, p. 250, seq. The author's definition is, p. 252,
							“the same attributes may be assigned to distinct but similar
							things, provided they can be shewn to accompany the points of
							resemblance in the things, and not the points of difference.” Or
							‘when the resemblance is undoubted, and does not depend on one or
							two external features’), “when one thing resembles another
							in known particulars, it will resemble it also in the unknown.” </p>

							rhetorical topic which is to guide men's practice, it is plain that we

							to do with the finite and infinite. Nor is it meant that things that can
							be begun necessarily admit of being finished: the Tower of Babel, as
							well as other recorded instances of <hi rend="italic">opera
								interrupta</hi>, shew that this is not true. And though it may be
							true of the design or intention, of any attempt, that it always looks
							forward to an end, immediate or remote, still to the public speaker it
							is facility and expediency, rather than the mere possibility, of the
							measure he is recommending, that is likely to be of service in carrying
							his point. All that is really meant is, that if you want to know whether
							the end of any course of action, plan, scheme, or indeed of
							anything—is possible, you must look to the begining: beginning
							implies end: if it can be begun, it can also be brought to an end:
							nothing that is known to be impossible, like squaring the circle, can
							ever have a beginning, or be brought into being. Schrader exemplifies it
							by, <hi rend="italic">Mithridates coepit vinci, ergo et debellari
								poterit.</hi> Proverbs and passages on the importance of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)rxh/</foreign> are cited in the note on I 7. 11. </p>
						<p>The incommensurability of the diameter with the side of the square, or,
							which is the same thing, the impossibility of squaring the circle, is
							Aristotle's stock illustration of <hi rend="italic">the impossible:</hi>
							see examples in Bonitz ad Metaph. A 2, 983 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 16.
							Euclid, Bk. X. Probl. ult. Trendelenburg, on de Anima III 6. 1, p. 500,
							explains this: the diameter of a square is represented by the root of 2,
							which is irrational, and therefore incommensurable with the side. He
							also observes that Aristotle cannot refer to the squaring of the circle;
							a question which was still in doubt in the time of Archimedes could not
							be assumed by Aristotle as an example of impossibility. The
							illustration, which passed into a proverb, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k
								diame/trou a)ntikei=sqai</foreign>, is confined to the side and
							diameter of the parallelogram. See also Waitz on Anal. Pr. 41 <hi
								rend="italic">a</hi> 26. </p>
						<p>‘And when the end is possible, so also is the beginning, because
							everything takes its origin, is generated, from a beginning’. The
							end implies the beginning: everything that comes into being or is
							produced —everything therefore with which the orator has to deal
							in his sphere of practical life—has a beginning. Since the
							beginning is implied in the end, it is clear that if the end be
							attainable or possible, so likewise must the beginning be. </p>

							This latter example is by the rule that every end necessarily implies a

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign> and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">u(/steron</foreign>, before and after, earlier and
							later, antecedent and subsequent, prior and posterior, can be applied,
							are Categ. c. 12, in which five varieties are distinguished, and Met.
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">*d</foreign> 11, in which there are four.
							On the former passage Waitz says in his Comm. p. 316, “non
							premendam esse divisionem quam nostro loco tradidit: apparet enim non id
							agi in his ut ipsa rerum natura exploretur et pervestigetur, sed ut quae
							usus ferat sermonis quotidiani distinguantur alterum ab altero et
							explicentur.’ </p>
						<p>In the Metaphysics, the divisions are four. In the first, prior and
							posterior refer us to a <hi rend="italic">series</hi> and an <hi
								rend="italic">order</hi>, established either by nature or by the
							human will, under which the <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=|
								gene/sei</foreign> of the Rhetoric will naturally fall. Of this
							there are five varieties, (1) <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
								to/pon</foreign>, local (comp. Phys. IV 11, 219 <hi rend="italic"
								>a</hi> 14, seq.); (2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
								xro/non</foreign>, chronological, the order of time (Phys. IV 14,
							223 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 4, seq.); (3) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>kata\ ki/nhsin</foreign>; (4) <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
								du/namin</foreign>, capacity or power; capacity a natural order,
							power either of nature or human choice; (5) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>kata\ ta/cin</foreign>. </p>
						<p>In the second the order of knowledge is referred to: only in two
							different applications the meaning of the two terms is inverted: in the
							order of <hi rend="italic">growth</hi> the particular is prior to the
							universal, sense and observation to generalisation or induction: in the
							order of dignity, the universal is prior to the particular, as the whole
							to the individual parts. The one is <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/teron
								pro\s h(ma=s</foreign>, the other, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pro/teron a(plw=s</foreign>. </p>
						<p>The third, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/tera le/getai ta\ tw=n prote/rwn
								pa/qh</foreign>, the priority of the attributes of the prior (in
							some series), as straightness is prior to smoothness, because the line
							is prior to the plane or surface—the notion is that the plane is
								<hi rend="italic">generated from</hi>, and so, in growth and origin,
							posterior to the line; and therefore the attribute of the latter is
							prior to that of the former—is not, as Bonitz remarks, coordinate
							with the three others, “pendet enim a reliquis, quae suapte natura
							sunt priora, tamquam accidens a subiecto suo qui inhaeret.” </p>
						<p>The fourth, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> of the
							Rhetoric, priority and posteriority in essence or substance, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ta\ kata\ fu/sin kai\ ou)si/an</foreign>; priority
							in this sense belongs to things <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/sa
								e)nde/xetai ei)=nai a)/neu a)/llwn</foreign>: that is, things which
							are independent of others, whereas the others (the posterior) are
							dependent on them: the latter imply the former, the former do not
							necessarily imply the latter. Such is the relation of one and two; two
							always imply one, <pb n="184"/> one does not necessarily imply two.
							Similarly the <hi rend="italic">first category</hi>, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> substance, is prior to all the
							others, which express only properties and attributes of the first. This
							priority is <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign>, which is
							evidently inserted merely because it was suggested by the opposite
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nesis</foreign>, and being utterly
							useless in Rhetoric, from which all nice distinctions and subtleties of
							all kinds are alien, is accordingly passed over in the illustration.
							This division of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> also
							includes priority of <foreign xml:lang="greek">du/namis</foreign> and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, where again the
							order of growth and of dignity inverts the relation of the two: <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">du/namis</foreign>, the capacity, being of course
							prior in growth or time, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)ne/rgeia</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">actus</hi>, the
							realization, or active and perfect condition, being superior in the
							order of dignity and importance, or in conception, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">lo/gw|</foreign>. </p>
						<p>Another division is that of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)si/a|</foreign>
							substance, <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gw|</foreign> conception, and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">xro/nw|</foreign>. Metaph. <foreign

								>bou/lhsis</foreign> is distinguished from <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>proai/resis</foreign>, deliberate moral purpose, by the absence of
							this. Further the exercise of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>proai/resis</foreign> is confined to things which are in our power
							to do or avoid; the wish sometimes is directed to what is impossible or
							unattainable, to immortality for instance or happiness. It is also
							directed to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, whereas <foreign

								too exclusively to the New Testament parables, when he says that the
								latter “is constructed to set forth a truth spiritual and
								heavenly,” whereas the fable “never lifts itself above
								the earth”; it “inculcates maxims of prudential
								morality, industry, caution, foresight,” all its morality
								being of a <hi rend="italic">worldly</hi> character, p. 2. And
								again, p. 9, “the parable differs from the fable, moving as it
								does in a spiritual world, and never transgressing the actual order
								of things natural.” <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, to whom
								Dr Trench does not refer, distinguishes parable <hi rend="italic">in
									general</hi> from fable by this; that the former depicts <hi
									rend="italic">human</hi> relations (in which the N. T. parable
								coincides with it); it <hi rend="italic">invents</hi> analogous
								cases, which are not <hi rend="italic">historical</hi>, but always
								such as <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be so; always probable, and
								corresponding with what actually occurs in real life. The fable is
									<hi rend="italic">pure fiction</hi>, and its essential
								characteristic is, that it invests beasts, birds, plants, and even
								things inanimate with the attributes of humanity.</note> the
							Socratic practice or method is an example; as for instance if one were
							to say, that the magistrates ought not to be chosen by lot: for this is
							analogous to the case of choosing for the athletes (who were to enter
							the lists) not those who are fitted for the combat, but those upon whom
							the lot falls; or to choosing the steersman out of a crew of sailors on
							the principle that it was the man who won the toss, and not the man of
							knowledge and skill (the man who knows his business), that ought to be
							chosen’. </p>
						<p>This very same analogy is ascribed to Socrates by the accuser at his
							trial, as one of those which he was in the habit of using, Xen. Memor. I
							2. 9. And the same mode of inference, from the analogy of the mechanical
							and other arts, was transmitted by Socrates to Plato, and through him to
							his pupil Aristotle, in whose writings it constantly appears in
							illustration of many of his moral and social and political theories. It
							is to this practice of Socrates that Critias refers, when he and
							Charicles, during the tyranny of the Thirty, summoned him before them,

						<p>The fable may be exemplified by that of Stesichorus about Phalaris, and

						<p>For when the Himereans had elected Phalaris general with absolute power,
							and were about to give him a body-guard, Stesichorus, after having
							finished the rest of his argument (or discussion), told them a fable,
							‘how a horse was the sole possessor of a meadow, when a stag came,
							and desiring to take vengeance upon the stag for spoiling his pasture he
							asked the man (or a man <foreign xml:lang="greek">tina/</foreign>, MS
							A^{c}, Spengel) if he could help him to chastise the stag: the other
							assented, on the condition of his accepting a bit and allowing himself
							to mount him with his javelins: so when he had agreed and the other had
							mounted, instead of his revenge he himself became a slave henceforth to
							the man: so likewise you, said he, see to it that ye do not in your
							desire of vengeance upon your enemies share the fate of the horse: for

							power, but if ye grant him a body-guard and let him get on your backs,

								melior communibus herbis pellebat</hi>, &amp;c. </p>
						<p>This fable of Stesichorus, which Aristotle here assigns to the age and

							time,’ Bentley, <hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi>, Vol. 1. p. 106
							(ed. Dyce [p. 101 ed. Wagner]) transferred to that of Gelon; and this
							latter version is regarded by Bentley as the more probable; ‘the
							circumstances of Gelon's history seem to countenance Conon.’
							‘If we suppose then with the Arundel marble that Stesichorus lived
							Ol. LXXIII 3,’ (this is highly improbable; it places Stesichorus'
								<hi rend="italic">floruit</hi> a full century too low, in the year
							B. C. 486; which should indeed be 485, the year in which Gelon became
							master of Syracuse, Clinton, <hi rend="italic">Fasti Hellenici, sub
								anno</hi>,) ‘it exactly <pb n="200"/> agrees with the age of
							Gelon, and Conon's account of the story may seem more credible than
							Aristotle's. And then all the argument that would settle Phalaris' age
							from the time of Stesichorus, will vanish into nothing’ (which is
							probably Bentley's principal reason for maintaining the paradox). Mure,
							Müller and Clinton, <hi rend="italic">F. H., sub anno</hi> 632,

							the literary indolence, or inactivity, the withdrawal from active life

							are led by their studious habits. This is what provokes the jealousy and

							in four well known passages, in the Republic [VI 484—497],
							Theaetetus [172 C] and Gorgias [527]; and in the seventh Epistle, if
							that be his [see Introd. to Dr Thompson's ed. of the Gorgias, pp.
							xii—xiv]. </p>
						<p>These lines are put into the enthymematic form, as an argument, in §

						<p>Aristotle has said that there are two classes of cases in which a <pb

							Solon's universally accepted maxim, or the precept conveyed by it, is

							the maxim could not be applied in this sense: the mere recollection of
							his former low estate surely is not entitled to the name of knowledge of
							self. Iphicrates, instead of disobeying the precept, conformed to it in
							the strictest sense; he did <hi rend="italic">know himself</hi> so well,
							he was so fully aware of his capacity for fulfilling the duties of the
							office, that he did not hesitate to apply for and exercise the command
							of an army. Victorius' words are; “<foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>paqhtikw=s</foreign> dicet, qui ira percitus ita loquetur”
							(but what is the <hi rend="italic">occasion</hi> of the anger, when it
							is thus interpreted? The mere contradiction of an universal maxim does
							not give rise to a fit of passion), “falsum est omnino, quod
							aiunt, debere homines seipsos nosse: hic enim profecto si se ipsum
							cognosset nunquam praetor ducere exercitum voluisset.” It may

							‘simple’ audience, whose powers of perception and memory
							will be alike unable to keep pace with him. The reasoning of the
							rhetorician must be as clear and as brief as possible. </p>
						<p>Secondly, he must draw his conclusion without expressing all that <pb
								n="222"/> belongs to the regular syllogism; this is also for the
							sake of brevity; the formal syllogism is unsuitable to the orator who
							has a great deal to say, and is hastening to his conclusion, fearing to
							weary his audience, because it <hi rend="italic">expresses</hi> a great
							deal that is self-evident, and may well be left for the hearers
							themselves to supply. Besides this, the enthymeme which he employs
							obliges him to omit either one of the two premisses or the conclusion;
							which of them it is to be, depends upon the degree in which the
							reasoning will be intelligible without it: anything that is absolutely
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">fanero/n</foreign> should (in reasoning)
							be omitted to save time. These are the two points in which the use of
							the enthymeme differs from that of the dialectical syllogism. </p>
						<p>With respect to the first, the dialectician, whose object is merely to
							gain the victory in the dispute, and who has an antagonist more or less
							a match for him, can take his own time, and need not accommodate his
							reasoning to the intelligence of his opponent: to the rhetorician, the
							time allowed is generally limited, he has usually an uneducated and
							perhaps unintelligent audience to address, which he must keep in good
							humour, and therefore neither puzzle nor weary. The second point conveys
							the essential difference between the enthymeme and dialectical
							syllogism, that in the former <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) pa/nta dei=
								lamba/nontas suna/gein. pa/nta</foreign> may also include, what
							Schrader adds, “multas propositiones probabiles, communes,

						<p>As to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/cewn</foreign>, this, through a
							deviation from the author's usual phraseology, who generally confines
							himself to <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign> and <foreign

							II 12 init., <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ d' h)/qh poi=oi/ tines kata\

							as Vahlen does, except the very insufficient one, that it is
								unusual<note anchored="true">I have noticed in many recent German
								commentators on Aristotle, Brandis being an honourable exception, a
								disposition to pin down their author to a fixed and particular mode
								of expression in certain cases from which he is never to be allowed
								to deviate. Aristotle is the very last writer to whom any such rule
								should be applied. He is always hasty, often careless; and, as we
								have seen in so many instances in this work, is very apt to use
								words in senses either vague and indeterminate, or (properly)
								inapplicable, or unusual; and his style is loose and careless to a
								fault, both in construction and expression. He is a writer who more
								than all others requires a most liberal allowance for
								irregularities.</note>. The <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e(/ceis</foreign> in this sense, do actually enter into, and in
							fact constitute the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>, and I do
							not see why they should not be specially mentioned, if Aristotle chose
							to depart from his ordinary practice, and do so. </p>
						<p>So far then we have been occupied with the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ei)/dh</foreign>, special subjects derived from special sciences,
							and specially employed each in one of the three departments of
							Rhetoric—this is generally, not absolutely true; for though the
							three ends of Rhetoric, the good or useful, the just, and the noble or
							right, are more appropriate and more serviceable, each in <hi
								rend="italic">one</hi> of the three branches, yet any of them can
							be, and sometimes is, introduced in them all—and we must now turn
							to the topics, the families, classes, of arguments into which enthymemes
							in <hi rend="italic">general</hi> may be made to fall. This is for
							convenience of practice, that we may know where to look for them when we
							want them, and apply that which happens to be appropriate to the
							particular case. This classification is made in the 23rd chapter, which
							therefore is the <hi rend="italic">rhetorical</hi> representative of the
							far more extensive and minute classification of <hi rend="italic"
								>dialectical</hi> topics, and is the object also of Cicero's Topica.
							And as the treatise on fallacies, the book <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>peri\ sofistikw=n e)le/gxwn</foreign>, is appended to the books of
							the Topics, so we have a similar chapter on rhetorical fallacies (c. 24)
							added to the analysis of the genuine arguments. </p>
						<p>I will here remark (against Vahlen) that the word <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">kaqo/lou</foreign> § 17, which contrasts these
							universal <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/poi</foreign> with the special

					<p>In an excellent <hi rend="italic">Review of the study of ancient
							Rhetoric</hi> [by Spengel], read at the celebration of the eighty-third
						anniversary of the foundation <pb n="237"/> of the Munich Academy of
						Sciences, 1842, a clear account is given of the relation of these <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">to/poi e)nqumhma/twn</foreign> that follow to the
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/dh</foreign> of the first book, of which I
						will give a translation with very slight alterations. </p>
					<p>To the first of these he gives the name of ‘formal’, to the
						second of ‘material’ proofs. “Formal proofs, such as they
						appear in Dialectics and Rhetoric, are of an universal nature, and therefore
						applicable alike to all branches of science; they form the collective
						Topics, which Aristotle has elaborated for Dialectics with wonderful
						completeness in the most comprehensive of all the works of his Organon;
						whilst in Rhetoric, not without reference to the other, he has selected and
						put forward only what is most essential. Material proofs are with him such
						as are derived from the principles of the special sciences, the knowledge of
						which the orator must bring with him, ready for any occasion on which it may
						be properly applied. Aristotle is by no means of opinion that a mere
						superficial description, without thorough knowledge of the object to be
						described, and alien to the true spirit of it, can be called
						‘rhetorical’ with propriety; on the contrary, the orator must be
						thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of his subject, whatever department of
						knowledge it may happen to belong to, and from this special science bring
						with him his concrete proofs, for the purpose of convincing. Accordingly,
						for forensic pleading the accurate study of law is indispensable, for the
						deliberative speaking or counselling that of Politics, the science of
						government, and similarly for each kind the special knowledge which belongs
						to it. But this special knowledge cannot be obtained from Rhetoric itself,
						otherwise it would carry in itself all knowledge, which is not the case: the
						office of Rhetoric is, to work up the proofs which the special science
						offers, to combine them with the ‘formal’, and so to bring the
						subject within the reach of universal comprehension.” </p>
					<p>On the contents of this chapter, and its connexion with the Topics, Brandis,
						ap. Schneidewin's <hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> [IV i.] p. 18, has the
						following remarks. “We now turn (c. 23) to the universal points of
						view (topics) most worthy of attention for the formation or refutation of
						enthymemes, which are briefly discussed. Before passing to this, Aristotle
						has already pointed out the connexion which exists between this division of
						the Rhetoric and the Topics (c. 22 § 10). It is perfectly conceivable
						however that here also (as before, referring to Rhet. I 7,) what in the
						Topics has met with a detailed discussion in regard of the various modes of
						applying them, is here only briefly referred to, and with an exclusive view
						to the application to be made of them in speaking.” He then
						illustrates this at some length from the two works; but it will be more
						convenient to leave these details till we come to them in the course of the
						notes on the topics themselves. [On the Topics, see in general Grote's <hi
							rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>, ch. IX.] </p>
					<p>Cicero, Topica, first gives a summary classification of the various forms of
						these arguments under their most general heads, III 11. These are, <hi
							rend="italic">coniugata, ex genere, ex forma, ex similitudine, ex
							differentia, ex contrario, ex adiunctis, ex antecedentibus, ex

						<hi rend="italic">possunt, locos communes nominamus</hi>, de Inv. II 15. 48.
						Quintilian treats them, Inst. Orat. V 10, 20—94, and sums them up

					<div xml:id="b2c23s1" type="section" n="1">
						<p>One class of demonstrative (or affirmative) enthymemes is derived from
								<hi rend="italic">opposites:</hi> we have to consider, namely,
							whether the opposite (to the one) belongs to (i. e. can be said, or
							predicated of) the opposite (to the other). Two pairs of opposites are
							supposed, as in the example, temperance and licentiousness, good, i. e.
							profitable, and injurious: the question is whether the two opposed terms
							or things stand in the same relation to one another, i. e. that one can
							be predicated of the other, as the two first, to which they <hi
								rend="italic">are</hi> opposed: if they can, the original
							proposition may be maintained, or inferred by the enthymeme; if not, it
							can be confuted or destroyed. The inference in either case is drawn
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k tw=n e)nanti/wn</foreign>, from the
							correctness or incorrectness, the truth or falsehood, of the assertion
							of compatibility or coexistence in the opposites, or that one <hi
								rend="italic">can</hi> be predicated of the other. Thus in the
							example, if the opposites to the original proposition—temperance
							is profitable— stand in the same relation to one another as the
							two members of the first, so that the one can be truly predicated of the
							other—if the opposite, injurious, is truly predicable of
							licentiousness—then, so far, we infer the truth of the first: if
							not, the proposition may be confuted. The inference, like all other
							rhetorical inferences, is <hi rend="italic">probable</hi>, not
							necessary: it can always be contradicted. </p>
						<p>Aristotle, as we have already seen (note on c. 19. 1), distinguishes four
							kinds of <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ntikei/mena</foreign>, or
							opposites; contradictory, contrary (extremes under the same genus, as
							here <foreign xml:lang="greek">swfrosu/nh</foreign> and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign> are the two extremes, virtue
							and vice, under the genus <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)=qos</foreign>,
							moral character), relative, and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e(/cis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ste/rhsis</foreign>,
							state and privation. In the Topics all the four kinds in their relation
							to this form of argument are successively handled; in the Rhetoric, the
							treatment is confined to the single kind of contraries, as the most
							useful and plausible, and the rest passed over. See Brandis, u. s., p.
							18. The passage in the Topics corresponding to this is B 8, 113 <hi
								rend="italic">b</hi> 27, seq. [Grote's <hi rend="italic">Ar.</hi> I,

							treatment of opposites in the Topics and Rhetoric corresponds in this,
							that in both works it has reference solely to the art of reasoning, to
							the inferences affirmative or negative that may be drawn by
							constructive, or refutative, syllogisms and enthymemes. </p>
						<p>Cicero (who borrows a good deal from Aristotle), Topic. XI. 47, <hi

						<p>Of Diomedon, nothing is known but what we learn from the passage. </p>
						<p>‘And if the terms fairly or justly can be applied to the sufferer,
							then also to the doer (or perpetrator) of the act; and conversely, if to
							the doer then also to the sufferer’. If there be any difference
							between this and the preceding, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) ga\r

						<p>‘But this admits of a fallacy: for though it may be true (in

							that) <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should be the agent of it, that the
							punishment should be inflicted by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (any

							Theodectes' Orestes, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> c. 24 § 3. The
							argument is used by Orestes in his trial for the murder of his mother
							Clytemnestra. In the trial scene of the Eumenides this point is taken
							into consideration, and the act of Orestes justified by Apollo and
							Athena on the general ground of the superiority of male to female; the

						<p>‘And therefore a separate investigation is required, not only
							whether the sufferer deserved to suffer, but also whether the doer had a
							right to do it (as, to inflict the punishment), and then make the
							appropriate use of either: because sometimes there is a difference in
							cases of this kind (i. e. both kinds of right are not always found
							together: the punishment may be just, but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may
							not be the proper person to inflict it), and there is nothing to prevent
							(the case being) as it is put in Theodectes’ Alcmaeon (where this
							‘division’, <foreign xml:lang="greek">dialabo/nta</foreign>,
							is actually made): “And did no mortal abhor thy mother?”
							This is a question put to Alcmaeon, probably by Alphesiboea (Victorius),
							whose reply includes the words actually quoted, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)lla\ dialabo/nta xrh\ skopei=n</foreign>, with,
							of course, a good deal more about the murder which is omitted. ‘To
							which (Alcmaeon) says in reply “nay but we must first distinguish,
							and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> consider the case.”’ (The
								<hi rend="italic">division</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
								>distinction</hi> here spoken of is well illustrated by the parallel
							passage, the case of Orestes, II 24. 3.) ‘And when Alphesiboea
							asks “How?”, he replies, “To her they adjudged death,
							(i. e. decided that she was justly slain,) but (decided also) that <hi
								rend="italic">I</hi> should not have been the
							murderer.”’ From this reply it may be gathered that the
							judges in Theodoctes' play had made the requisite distinction: the death
							of Eriphyle they agreed was deserved, but it was not for her son to
							inflict the penalty. “Alcmaeon Eriphylen matrem suam interfecerat,
							quod haec Amphiarai mariti salutem prodiderat” (Alcmaeon's act,
							like that of <pb n="244"/> Orestes, was justified by the implied murder
							of his father—the treachery which caused his death).
							“Alphesiboea fuit Alcmaeonis uxor.” Schrader. This fragment

						<p>On Theodectes of Phaselis, the rhetorician and dramatic poet, the friend
							of Aristotle, who frequently refers to his compositions in both kinds,
							and on the rhetorical character of his writings, which is well
							illustrated here and in II 24. 3, see Müller, <hi rend="italic"
								>Hist. Gr. Lit.</hi> ch. XXVI § 7, who refers to these
							passages. Also, <hi rend="italic">Camb. Journ. of Cl. and Sacred

							Philoctetes, Eth. Nic. VII 8, 1150 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 9. </p>
						<p>Two other examples follow, but, as Spengel (<hi rend="italic">Tract on
								the Rhet.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Trans. Bav. Acad.</hi>, Munich
							1851, p. 46) justly says, they have no connexion with the preceding
							example from Theodectes, and the division which it exemplifies, but are
							illustrations of the general topic. Retaining the text (with Bekker) as
							it stands, we must accordingly understand the words <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)/sti d' e)n tou/tw|—mh\ ktanei=n</foreign>
							as parenthetical, and suppose that the author, after the insertion of
							this as a <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, proceeds with his exemplification
							of the general topic. Spengel, u. s., p. 47, suggests that they may have
							been a later addition by the author himself, a note written on the
							margin, which has got out of its place. My supposition, of a note, <hi
								rend="italic">not</hi> written on the margin, but embodied in the
							text as a parenthesis—which is quite in Ar.'s manner—will
							answer the purpose equally well, and save the text in addition. </p>
						<p>‘And, another example, the trial of Demosthenes and those who slew
							Nicanor; for as they were adjudged to have slain him justly (the act),
							it was held that his death (the passion or suffering) was just’.
							This is cited by Dion. Halicarn., Ep. I ad Amm. c. 12, as a proof that
							Aristotle was acquainted with and quoted the speeches of Demosthenes,
							referring it to the case (against Aeschines) for the Crown. In doing so
							he omits <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri/</foreign>. Of course <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">h( peri\ *dhmosqe/nous di/kh</foreign> cannot have
							this meaning: and it is most probable that it is not the Orator that is
							here referred to, but Thucydides' general, or some other person of the
							name. <pb n="245"/> Neither is anything known of Nicanor and his
							murderers. On the use of Demosthenes' name in the Rhetoric, see Introd.
							p. 46, note 2. </p>
						<p>‘And again, the case of him that died at Thebes; concerning whom he
							(the spokesman of the defendants) bade them (the judges) decide whether
							he (the murdered man) deserved death, since there was no injustice in
							putting to death one that deserved it’. “In hanc quoque
							historiam nunquam incidi.” Victorius. Buhle rightly refers it to
							the case of Euphron, introduced as an episode, and described at length
							by Xenophon, Hellen. VII 3. There had been one of the usual quarrels
							between the aristocratical (<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(
								be/ltistoi</foreign>) and the popular party at Sicyon, of which
							Euphron took advantage, with the design of making himself master of the
							city. But knowing that as long as the Thebans occupied the acropolis he
							had no chance of success, he collected a large sum of money and went to
							Thebes with the intention of bribing the Thebans to assist him. Some
							Sicyonian exiles learning this, followed him to Thebes and murdered him
							in the acropolis. Here the murderers were brought to trial before the
							magistrates and council, who were already there assembled. The
							accusation of the magistrates, and the speech for the defence, are both
							recorded. All the accused with one exception asserted their innocence:
							one alone admitted the fact, and in justification of it pleaded for
							himself and the rest the guilt of the man that had been slain, just as
							Aristotle here describes it. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*oi( me\n ou)=n
								*qhbai=oi tau=ta a)kou/santes e)/gnwsan di/kaia to\n *eu)/frona
								peponqe/nai</foreign>. But the Sicyonians (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>oi( poli=tai</foreign>), interpreting the word ‘good’
							in the sense of good to them (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s
								eu)erge/tas e(autw=n</foreign>), said he was a <hi rend="italic"
								>good</hi> man, and buried him in the market-place, and adore him as
							the (second) founder of their city (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s
								a)rxhge/thn</foreign>), like Brasidas at Amphipolis (Thuc. V. 11). </p>
						<p>The whole of this section, with the exception of the last example,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ peri\ tou= *qh/bhsin
								a)poqano/ntos</foreign>, is quoted by Dionysius l. c. in support of
							his view that Demosthenes' speeches had been delivered before the
							composition of the Rhetoric, and were accessible to its author. The
							difference between the text which he seems to have used and that now
							received is very great, and apparently unaccountable. Besides minor
							discrepancies, the entire quotation from Theodectes, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)nio/te ga\r—ktanei=n</foreign> is omitted;

								ma=llon</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">ex maiore ad minus:</hi> the
							man who would strike his father (the greater) would <hi rend="italic">a
								fortiori</hi> strike an ordinary acquaintance. But Ar. has here
							departed from this usual application of the topic, and makes the
							comparison in respect of the <hi rend="italic">frequency</hi> of the
							crime: as it is less usual to strike one's father than one's neighbour,
							a man that could be guilty of the former, is much <hi rend="italic">more

						<p>The second branch of these inferences from comparison, is that of

							of his opportunity, (see the lexicons, s. v. <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							good faith’. The former event occurred in B. C. 346, when Philip
							allied himself with the Thebans and overran Phocis, and so put an end to
							the Phocian war. An embassy was sent to the Thebans after the capture of
							Elataea B. C. 339, to request that Philip's troops might be allowed to
							march through their territory to attack Attica; but was met by a

						<p>Top. VII. Definition. The definition of terms is the basis of all sound

							fallacy and misunderstanding. A clear definition is therefore necessary
							for intelligible reasoning. To establish definitions, and so come to a
							clear understanding of the thing in controversy, was, as Aristotle tells
							us, the end and object of the Socratic method. The use of the definition
							in dialectics is treated in the Topics, A 15, 107 <hi rend="italic"

						<p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> example of the argument from definition,
							is the inference drawn by Socrates at his trial from the definition of
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ daimo/nion</foreign>, Plat. Apol.
							Socr. c. 15. Meletus accuses him of teaching his young associates not to
							believe in the gods recognized by the state, and introducing other new
							divinities, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/tera daimo/nia
							kaina/</foreign>, in their place. Socrates argues that upon Meletus' own
							admission he believes in <foreign xml:lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign>
							divine things (27 C); but divine things or works imply a workman; and
							therefore a belief in <foreign xml:lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign>
							necessarily implies a belief in the authors of those works, viz.
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>. But <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign> are universally held to be
							either <foreign xml:lang="greek">qeoi/</foreign> or <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">qew=n pai=des</foreign> (27 D), and therefore in
							either case a belief in <foreign xml:lang="greek">daimo/nia</foreign>
							still implies a belief in the gods. The conclusion is <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">tou= au)tou= ei)=nai daimo/nia kai\ qei=a
								h(gei=sqai</foreign> (E). </p>
						<p>In Xenophon's apology this argument is entirely omitted; and Socrates is
							represented as interpreting the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaina\
								daimo/nia</foreign> (which he is accused of introducing) of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">to\ daimo/nion</foreign>, the divine sign which
							checked him when he was about to do wrong; and this is referred to the
							class of divine communications—oracles, omens, divination and so
							forth. </p>
						<p>As to the status of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>
							opinions varied: but the usual conception of them was, as appears in
							Hesiod, Op. et D. 121, and many passages of Plato, Timaeus, Laws (VIII
							848 D, <foreign xml:lang="greek">qew=n te kai\ tw=n e(pome/nwn qeoi=s
								daimo/nwn</foreign>), IV 713 B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k
								a)nqrw/pous a)lla\ ge/nous qeiote/rou te kai\ a)mei/nonos,
								dai/monas</foreign>, and elsewhere, that they were an order of
							beings, like angels, intermediate between men and gods, and having the
							office of tutelary deities or guardian angels to the human race. So
							Hesiod, u. s., Theogn. 1348 (of Ganymede), Plat. Phaedo 108 B, 107 D,
							113 D. Aristotle seems to imply the same distinction when he says, de
							Div. per Somn. 1 2, init., that dreams are not <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>qe)pempta</foreign>, because they are natural, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">daimo/nia me/ntoi: h( ga\r</foreign>
							<pb n="256"/>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/sis daimoni/a, a)ll' ou) qei/a</foreign>.
							This argument of Socrates is repeated, III 18. 2, more at length, and
							with some difference of detail. </p>
						<p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> example is taken from Iphicrates'
							speech upon the prosecution of Harmodius, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>di/kh pro\s *(armo/dion</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>
							§ 6, “cum Harmodius generis obscuritatem obiiceret,
							definitione <hi rend="italic">generosi</hi> et <hi rend="italic"
								>propinqui</hi> fastum adversarii repressit et decus suum
							defendit.” Schrader. Harmodius had evidently been boasting of his
							descent from the famous Harmodius, and contrasting his own noble birth
							with the low origin of Iphicrates. The latter replies, by defining true
							nobility to be merit, and not mere family distinction (comp. II 15, and
							the motto of Trinity College, <hi rend="italic">virtus vera
								nobilitas</hi> [Iuv. VIII. 20 <hi rend="italic">nobilitas sola est
								atque unica virtus</hi>]); ‘for Harmodius (himself) and
							Aristogeiton had no <hi rend="italic">nobility</hi> anterior to their
							noble <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>’. Next as to the relationship
							which Harmodius claimed: he himself is in reality more nearly related to
							Harmodius than his own descendant: true kinsmanship is shewn in
							similarity of actions: ‘at all events my <hi rend="italic"
								>deeds</hi> are more nearly akin to those of Harmodius and
							Aristogeiton than thine’. This is still more pointedly expressed
							in Plutarch's version, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)apofqe/gmata
								basile/wn kai\ strathgw=n</foreign> Iphicr. <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e/</foreign>, p. 187 B, <foreign xml:lang="greek"

								e)mou= ge/nos a)/rxetai, to\ de\ so\n e)n soi\ pau/etai</foreign>.
							This seems to be taken, with alterations, from a speech of Lysias, ap.
							Stob. flor. 86. 15, quoted by Sauppe, Fragm. Lys. XVIII. <hi
								rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> III 180. Another form of Iphicrates'

						<p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is taken from the Alexander of some

							and 9. On this Schrader; “sententia illius videtur haec esse:
							Paridem intemperantem habendum non esse, una quippe Helena contentum.
							Argumentum e definitione temperantis (temperantiae) petitum.”
							Similarly Victorius, “<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\

						<p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> is, the reason that Socrates gave for

							injuries (ill treatment). This was a new definition, or an extension of

							an <hi rend="italic">act</hi> of aggression. <foreign xml:lang="greek"

						<p>‘And another instance from Theodectes' “law”—if
							to those who have mismanaged other people's horses we don't entrust
							horses of our own, or (our ships) to those who have upset the ships of
							others; then, if the rule hold universally, those who have ill guarded
							or maintained the safety and well-being of others, are not to be
							employed in (entrusted with) the preservation of our own’. Sauppe,
							Fragm. Theod. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*no/mos</foreign> (<hi

							every appearance of probability that Theodectes' ‘law’
								“(<hi rend="italic">declamationem</hi>) ad rationes militum
							mercenariorum lege ab Atheniensibus accurate ordinandas
							pertinuisse.” Both the fragments quoted by Aristotle, here, and
							again § 17, agree perfectly with this view. The extract here
							stigmatizes the folly shewn by the Athenians in entrusting their
							interests to mercenaries—like Charidemus and his fellows—who
							have already shewn their incapacity and untrustworthiness whilst in the
							employment of others—foreign princes and states—who have
							used their services. The other extract, § 17, is to shew that by
							their gross misconduct and the mischief they have already done, most of
							them—with the exception perhaps of men like Strabax and
							Charidemus—have entirely disqualified themselves for employment.
							From the example in Theodectes' ‘law’, the <hi rend="italic"

							by the author himself. Aristotle is capable of this; continuing perhaps
							to quote from Alcidamas, he may have neglected to supply the proper

							induction may be the Platonic paradox that the true statesmen are
							philosophers: this appears from the three examples, ‘that the
							Athenians flourished and were happy under the laws of Solon, and the
							Lacedaemonians under those of Lycurgus; and at Thebes, the prosperity
							(or flourishing condition) of the city was coeval with the accession of

							submit to the Court of Areopagus the trial of some charge against him,

						<p>The appearance of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">semnai\ qeai/</foreign>
							as prosecutors in the court of the Areopagus is of course a reference to
							their prosecution of Orestes in Aeschylus' Eumenides. Of Mixidemides we
							know but the name. Autocles was a much more important personage. He was
							an Athenian, son of Strombichides, Xen. Hellen. VI 3. 2, one of the
							seven ambassadors sent to the congress at Sparta in 371 B.C., in the
							spring before the battle of Leuctra, Xen. l. c., who reports his speech
							§ 7. Xenophon (u. s. § 7) calls him <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ma/la e)pistrefh\s r(h/twr</foreign>, ‘a very careful
							orator’ (so Sturz, Lex. Xen. and Lexx. but I think rather,
							‘dexterous’, one who could readily <hi rend="italic">turn
								himself about</hi> to anything, ‘versatile’: and so
							apparently Suidas, who renders it <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)gxi/nous</foreign>). Autocles was again employed in 362—361
							“in place of Ergophilus (Rhet. II 3. 13) to carry on war for
							Athens in the Hellespont and Bosporus.” (Grote.) Xenophon's
							Hellenics do not reach this date. His operations against Cotys in the
							Chersonese, and subsequent trial, are mentioned by Demosth. c. Aristocr.
							§ 104 and c. Polycl. § 12, and his name occurs, pro Phorm.
							§ 53 [A. Schaefer's <hi rend="italic">Dem. u. s. Zeit</hi> I pp.
							64, 134 and III 2. p. 158]. See Grote, <hi rend="italic">H. G.</hi> X

						<p>‘Or (another example) Sappho's saying, that death must be an evil:

						<p>‘Or again, as Aristippus to Plato, when he pronounced upon some

						<p>Aristippus draws an inference from the <hi rend="italic">authority</hi>
							of their common master—who never dictated, but left every question

							to be instructed rather than to instruct—to the proper rule in
							conducting philosophical discussion. On Aristippus see Grote's Plato,
							Vol. III. p. 530, seq. ch. XXXVIII. </p>
						<p>On this passage, see Grote, Plato, III 471, and note. In qualification of
							what is there said of Plato's ‘arrogance’, so far as it can
							be gathered <pb n="266"/> from our text, take Victorius' commentary on
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s w)/|eto</foreign>, with which I
							entirely agree: “quae sequuntur verba modestiam Platonis
							defendunt, et paene declarant sine causa Aristippum arrogantiae eum
							insumulasse: addit enim <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s w)/|eto</foreign>,
							ut opinio illius erat.” I will not however deny that Plato may
							even in conversation have been occasionally guilty of dogmatizing: in
							his latest writings, such as the Timaeus and Laws, and to a less degree
							in the Republic, such a tendency undoubtedly shews itself: but by far
							the larger portion of his dialogues, which represent probably nearly
							three-fourths of his entire life, are pervaded by a directly opposite
							spirit, and are the very impersonation of intellectual freedom.
							Following the method and practice of his master, he submits every
							question as it arises to the freest dialectical discussion, so that it
							is often impossible to decide which way (at the period of writing any
							particular dialogue) his own opinion inclines; and always presents in
							the strongest light any objections and difficulties in the thesis which
							he is maintaining. I think at all events with Victorius that Aristotle
							at any rate lends no countenance here to Aristippus' charge of dogmatic
							assumption. So far as his outward bearing and demeanour were concerned,
							I can conceive that he may have been haughty and reserved, possibly even
							morose: but a habit of ‘laying down the law’, or of undue
							assumption and pretension in lecturing and discussion—which is
							what Aristippus appears here to attribute to him—seems to me to be
							inconsistent with what we known from his dialogues to have been the
							ordinary habit of his mind, at least until he was already advanced in
								life<note anchored="true">I have expressed my opinion upon some

							them seems to be ‘concomitant’; that which constantly waits
							or attends upon something, either as antecedent, simultaneous, or
							subsequent. </p>
						<p>There are two topics of consequents, XIII and XIV. The first is simple.
							Most things have some good and some bad consequent usually or
							inseparably attached to them, as wisdom and the envy of fellow-citizens
							are the ordinary results of education. In exhortation, defence, and
							encomium (the three branches of Rhetoric) we urge the favourable
							consequence—the resulting wisdom in the case proposed—if we
							have to dissuade, to accuse, to censure, the unfavourable; each as the
							occasion may require. The second is somewhat more complex. Here we have
							two opposites (<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ duoi=n kai\
								a)ntikeime/noin</foreign>) to deal with—in the example public
							speaking falls into the two alternatives of true and fair speaking, and
							false and unfair. These are to be treated ‘in the way before
							mentioned’, <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| pro/teron ei)rhme/nw|
								tro/pw|</foreign>: that is, in exhorting or recommending we take the
							favourable consequent, in dissuading the unfavourable. But the
							difference between the two topics lies in this (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">diafe/rei de/</foreign>); that in the former the
							opposition (that must be the opposition of the good and bad consequent,
							for there is no other) is <hi rend="italic">accidental</hi>—that
							is, as appears in the example, there is no relation or logical connexion
							between wisdom and envy; they may be compared in respect of their value
							and importance as motives to action, but are not logical
							opposites—but in the latter, the good and the bad consequences are
							two contraries (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta)nanti/a</foreign>) love and
							hatred, divine and human. In the example of the second topic, the
							dissuasive argument which comes first assigns evil consequences (<hi
								rend="italic">hatred</hi>) to both alternatives of public speaking:
							that in recommendation, the contrary, <hi rend="italic">love.</hi> The
							topic of consequences, in the general sense, as above explained, has
							been already applied in estimating the value of goods <hi rend="italic"
								>absolute</hi>, I 6.3; and in the comparison of good things, I 7.5.
							In Dialectics it does not appear in this simple shape, though it is
							virtually contained in the application of it to the four modes of
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nti/qesis</foreign> or opposition, Top.
							B 8; and in the <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> of two good things,

							between them, and argue either for or against it, persuading or
							dissuading. (Note a good instance of <foreign xml:lang="greek">me\n

						<p>The translation, as the passage stands, is ‘and the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> is, or consists in, this, when
							each (either) of two contraries is followed (accompanied) by a good and

							contraries are the fair and unfair speaking; each of which has its
							favourable and unfavourable consequence; truth, the love of God and
							hatred of men; falsehood, the love of men and hatred of God. But how
							this is connected with <foreign xml:lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> I
							confess myself unable to discover. The nearest approach I have been able
							to make to it—which I only mention to condemn—is to
							understand <foreign xml:lang="greek">blai/swsis</foreign> of the <hi

						<p>Top. XV. This Topic is derived from the habit men have, which may be
							assumed to be almost universal, of concealing their real opinions and
							wishes in respect of things good and bad, which are always directed to
							their own interests, under the outward show and profession of noble and
							generous sentiments and of a high and pure morality. Thus, to take two
							examples from de Soph. El. c. 12, they openly profess that a noble death
							is preferable to a life of pleasure; that poverty and rectitude, is
							better than ill-got gains, than wealth accompanied with disgrace: but
							secretly they think and wish the contrary. These contrary views and
							inclinations can always be played off one against the other in argument,
							and the opponent made to seem to be asserting a paradox: you infer the
							one or the other as the occasion requires. This is in fact the most
							effective (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kuriw/tatos</foreign>) of all
							topics for bringing about this result. The mode of dealing with the
							topic is thus described in de Soph. El. l. c. 173 <hi rend="italic"
								>a</hi> 2, “If the thesis is in accordance with their real
							desires, the <pb n="275"/> respondent should be confronted with their
							public professions; if it is in accordance with them [the latter], he
							should be confronted with their real desires. In either case he must
							fall into paradox, and contradict either their publicly expressed, or
							secret opinions.” Poste, Transl. p. 43. This is for dialectics:
							but it may be applied equally well to rhetorical practice, in which
							there is nearly always a real or (as in the epideictic branch) imaginary
							opponent. The author proceeds, Ib. 173 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 7,
							further to illustrate this by the familiar opposition of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">fu/sis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>no/mos</foreign>, nature and convention or custom, which is to be
							handled in the same way as the preceding, and is <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">plei=stos to/pos tou= ta\ para/doca
								le/gein</foreign>: referring to Callicles' well-known exposition of
							the true doctrine of justice conventional and natural, in Plato's
							Gorgias, c. 38, foll. </p>
						<p>This topic does not occur in Cicero's tract, which is confined to
							dialectics; nor is it found amongst the rhetorical topics of
							Quintilian's tenth chapter of Book V, which has supplied us with so many
							illustrations of Aristotle. </p>
						<p>‘Another; whereas in public and in secret men praise not the same
							things, but openly most highly extol what is just and right, yet
							secretly (privately, in their hearts,) prefer their own interest and
							advantage, from these (i. e. from premisses derived from the one or the
							other of these two modes of thought and expression, whichever it be that
							the opponent has given utterance to,) we must endeavour to infer the
							other: for of all <hi rend="italic">paradoxical</hi> topics (topics that
							lead to paradox, which enable us to represent the opponent as guilty of
							it,) this is the most effective (most powerful, mightiest, most
							authoritative)’. If the opponent has been indulging in some
							high-flown moral commonplaces about virtue and honour, by an appeal to
							the real but <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> feelings of the audience on
							such matters, we must shew that such sentiments are paradoxical, or
							contrary to common opinion; or conversely, if we have occasion to assume
							the high moral tone, make our appeal to those opinions which they openly
							profess, and shew that it is a paradox to assume with the opponent that
							men are incapable of any other motives than such as are suggested by
							sordid self-interest. </p>

						<p>The words quoted by Ar. are taken from a speech of Lysias, of which
							Dionysius, de Lys. Iud. c. 33, has preserved a long fragment; printed
							amongst Lysias' speeches as Orat. 34. Baiter et Sauppe <hi rend="italic"
								>Or. Att.</hi> I 147. [Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische
								Beredsamkeit</hi> I p.441 and Jebb's <hi rend="italic">Attic
								Orators</hi> I p. 211.] Dion. gives an account of the occasion of it
							in the preceding chapter. He doubts if it was ever actually delivered.
							The title of it is, <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ tou= mh\ katalu=sai
								th\n pa/trion politei/an *)aqh/nh|si</foreign>; and its object was
							to prevent the carrying into effect of a proposal of one Phormisius, one
							of the restored exiles <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ tou=
								dh/mou</foreign>,—this was after the expulsion of the Thirty
							in 403 B. C., when the demus had been restored and recovered its
							authority, and the other party were now in exile—to permit the
							return of the present exiles, but to accompany this by a constitutional
							change, which should exclude from political rights all but the
							possessors of land; a measure which would have disfranchised 5000
							citizens. The passage here quoted refers to a somewhat different
							subject. The Lace<pb n="281"/> daemonians, who were at hand with their
							troops, were trying to impose the measure upon them by force, dictating,
							and ordering, <foreign xml:lang="greek">keleu/ousin,
								prosta/ttousin</foreign>, § 6, and apparently preparing to
							interfere with arms. Lysias is accordingly exhorting the Athenians to
							resist manfully, and not to give way and quit the city again, after
							their restoration, for fear of having to fight: and Aristotle—and
							this is a most striking instance of the difficulty that so frequently
							arises from Aristotle's haste and carelessness in writing, and also of
							his constant liability to lapses of memory—quoting from memory,
							and quoting wrong, and neglecting to mention the occasion of the speech
							and the name of the author, which he had probably forgotten for the
							time,—has both altered the words and omitted precisely the two
								things—<foreign xml:lang="greek">deino\n a)\n ei)/h</foreign>,
							which shows what the <hi rend="italic">inference</hi> is intended to be,
							and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*lakedaimoni/ois</foreign>—which
							would have enabled his readers to understand his meaning. The passage of
							Lysias runs thus: <foreign xml:lang="greek">deino\n ga\r a)\n ei)/h, w)=
								*)aqhnai=oi, ei) o(/te me\n e)feu/gomen, e)maxo/meqa
								*lakedaimoni/ois i(/na kate/lqwmen, katelqo/ntes de\ feuco/meqa
								i(/na mh\ maxw/meqa</foreign>. And it is now pretty clear what the
							intention of the writer of the fragment was, namely to stimulate the
							Athenian assembly not to submit to the dictation of the Lacedaemonians
							and to encounter them if it were necessary in battle, by urging the
							inconsistency and absurdity of which they would be guilty, if, whilst
							they were ready to fight before their restoration to their city, now
							that they were in actual possession of it they should quit it and return
							into exile, merely to avoid fighting. </p>

						<p>Top. XIX. The wording of this is also very obscure from the extreme
							brevity. The title of the topic in one of Victorius' MSS is <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)k tou= para\ to\n sko/pon tou= labo/ntos,
								sumbai/nein</foreign>, ‘inference, from the issue being
							contrary to the aim or intention of the receiver,’—i. e. a

							single instance of the application of the topic, and derived solely from
							the <hi rend="italic">illustration</hi>, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>oi(=on ei) doi/h k.t.l.</foreign> The true interpretation is, as
							Brandis expresses it, u. s., p. 20, the general one, “An inference
							from the possible, to the real, motive,” as appears from the
							examples. </p>
						<p>Two readings have to be considered: v. l. followed and explained by
							Victorius <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) mh\ ge/noito</foreign>, which
							Bekker (ed. 3) has retained; and, Vater's conjecture, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">h)\ ge/noito</foreign>, following the Schol.,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(/tinos e(/neka ei)=nai, h)/toi, dio\
								di/dwmi/ soi nomi/smata</foreign> (this again refers exclusively to
							the first example). <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ ge/noito, h)/toi
								e)/dwka</foreign>: which at all events seems to shew that <hi
								rend="italic">he</hi> read <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\
								ge/noito</foreign>: this is also expressed in Muretus' version,
							‘cuius rei causa aliquid est, aut fieri potest,’ and adopted
							by Spengel in his recent edition. To this in what follows <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai h)\ gegenh=sqai</foreign> properly
							corresponds. The translation will then be, ‘To say, that the <hi
								rend="italic">possible</hi> reason for a fact (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ei)=nai</foreign>) or motive for an action
								(<foreign xml:lang="greek">gi/gnesqai</foreign>), (<hi rend="italic"
								>lit.</hi> that for which anything <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be,
							or be done), <hi rend="italic">that is</hi> the (true) reason or motive
							of the fact or action; as in the case of one giving another something,
							in order to cause him pain by afterwards taking it away (withdrawing
							it)’. Here is an ostensible motive—a <hi rend="italic"
								>gift</hi> being usually intended to cause pleasure—which <pb
								n="282"/> conceals the real motive, which is to cause pain; and this
							is the inference, you infer from the apparent fact or possible motive to
							the real one; the object of the topic being to assign a motive which
							suits your argument. Such then is the general meaning of the topic: the
							examples are all of the possible concealed <hi rend="italic">motive</hi>
							or <hi rend="italic">intention</hi>—which may be bad or good as
							your argument requires—that being the form in which it is more
							likely to be of use in Rhetoric. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(= e(/nek'
								a)\n ei)/h h)\ ge/noito</foreign> ‘that for which so and so
							would, could, or might be, or be done’, (<hi rend="italic"
								>would</hi> be naturally or generally, <hi rend="italic">might</hi>
							be possibly,) expresses the conditionality or possibility of the fact,
							motive, or intention, a meaning which is confirmed by <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)nde/xetai ga/r k.t.l.</foreign>, in the
							explanation of the third example. (I call it the <hi rend="italic"
								>third</hi>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(=on ei) doi/h
								a)/n—luph/sh|</foreign> being an illustration.) </p>
						<p>On Victorius' interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) mh\
								ge/noito</foreign>, ‘cuius rei caussa aliquid esse potest, <hi
								rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>,’ Vater says,
							“sed hoc <hi rend="italic">quamvis factum non sit</hi>, ad rem non
							satis facit, neque in exemplis quae sequuntur eo respicitur an haec
							caussa vera sit necne:” but whether that be so or not, I think
							that a still better reason may be given for rejecting it, that <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ei) mh\ ge/noito</foreign>
							<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be rendered <hi rend="italic">quamvis</hi>
							&amp;c., which would require <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)
								kai/</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ ei)</foreign>
								(<foreign xml:lang="greek">kei)</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>mh\ ge/noito</foreign>. Victorius seems to mean, though the Greek
							(even independently of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign> for <hi
								rend="italic">quamvis</hi>) would hardly I think bear such an
							interpretation, ‘to assert that what <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be
							the cause of a thing (i. e. an act) really is so, although it has not
							been (or, were not) done at all’; in other words, ‘though it
							is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>’: and this, though I cannot think it
							the right rendering, can scarcely be said to be altogether ‘beside
							the point.’ </p>

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) du/nait' a)/n</foreign>, c.20.5,

							<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/n</foreign>
							<hi rend="italic">with Optative after certain particles</hi>’
							[printed at the end of the notes to this Book]. </p>
						<p>In conformity with the explanation there given, <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>doi/h a)/n</foreign>, the conditional, is joined with <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">ei)</foreign>, just as the future might be, of
							which in fact the conditional (as the <hi rend="italic">tense</hi> is in
							French and Italian) is a mere modification. </p>
						<p>The first example, from an unknown Tragic poet (Wagner, <hi rend="italic"
								>Fragm. Tragic. Gr.</hi> III 186), warns us that ‘Heaven
							bestows on many great successes or prosperity, which it offers not out
							of good will, with no kind or benevolent intent, but that the disasters
							that they (afterwards) meet with may be more marked and
							conspicuous’—a contrast of the apparent with the real
							intention, from which an inference may be drawn and applied to a
							parallel case. Victorius compares Caes. de B. G. I 14 (ad Helvet.
							legatum) <hi rend="italic">Consuesse deos immortales, quo gravius
								homines ex commutatione rerum doleant, quos pro scelere eorum
								ulcisci velint, his secundiores interdum res et diuturniorem

						<p>‘And another from Antiphon's Meleager’. Referred to above, II

						<p>A third from Theodectes' Ajax (Aj. Frag. 1, Wagner, u. s., p. 118); cited
							again § 24, and III 15. 10, where the same passage of the play is
							referred to. It is there employed in illustration of the interpretation
							of a fact or a motive, favourable or unfavourable according to the
							requirements of the argument; exactly as in the topic now under
							consideration. Ar. there explains in much plainer terms its use and
							application: <foreign xml:lang="greek">koino\n de\ tw=| diaba/llonti
								kai\ tw=| a)poluome/nw|, e)peidh\ to\ au)to\ e)nde/xetai pleio/nwn
								e(/neka praxqh=nai, tw=| me\n diaba/llonti kakohqiste/on e)pi\ to\

							construction upon the act and its motive), <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>tw=| de\ a)poluome/nw| e)pi\ to\ beltion</foreign> (the reverse).
							The same explanation will apply to both quotations alike. Theodectes'
							play contained no doubt a rhetorical contest—which would be quite
							in his manner, like Ovid's— between Ajax and Ulysses for the arms
							of Achilles, in which the argument from the construction of motives
							would be applied to the fact, by the competitors, in the two opposite
							senses. Ulysses would refer to the ‘preference’ (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">proei/leto</foreign> occurs in both the passages),
							shewing a sense of his superior merit, implied by Diomede when he chose
							him out of all the Greeks to be his companion in the hazardous exploring
							expedition to Troy by night (Hom. Il. K. 227 seq. Ovid. Met. XIII 238
							seq. <hi rend="italic">Est aliquid de tot Graiorum millibus unum A
								Diomede legi</hi>, line 241); Ajax would retort that this was not
							the real motive of Diomede's choice, but it was that ‘the
							attendant might be inferior to himself’ (II 23. 20) or (as it is
							expressed in III 15. 10,) ‘because he alone was too mean to be his
							rival’, to compete with him in his achievements, and to share in
							the renown to be thereby acquired. </p>

						<p>Top. XX. ‘Another, common to counsellors (in deliberative rhet.) as
							well as the two parties in forensic pleadings’. This seems to
							imply that the preceding topic is confined to the forensic branch; and
							to this, of the three, it is no doubt, most applicable; the suggestion
							and construction of motives and intentions being there most of all in
							request. Still in an encounter of two opponents in the public assembly,

						<p>It embraces arguments, which may be used in the deliberative kind in
							exhorting to some act or course of policy, or dissuading from it; and in

							4.9) ‘involving loss to enemies, or (if or when) the (legal)
							penalty (for doing something) is less than the thing (that is, the thing
							done, the success of the deed and the profit of it’,
							(‘fructus voluptasque quae inde percipitur’: ‘quod

							construction of the last words, <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ e)lattwn

							to the preceding nominatives; ‘the penalty being less than the
							profit’ is another incentive to action. ‘From such cases as
							these, arguments of exhortation or encouragement are drawn, dissuasive
							from their contraries (impossibility, difficulty, disadvantage, injury,
							&amp;c.). From these same are derived arguments for accusation and
							defence: from dissuasives or deterrents, of defence; from persuasives,
							of accusation’. That is to say, in defending a client from a

							[Cic. Phil. II § 35]. Compare with this the passage upon the

						<p>‘And of this topic the entire “art” of Pamphilus and
							Callippus is made up’. Of Callippus it has been already stated,
								<hi rend="italic">supra</hi> § 14, that nothing is known but
							these two notices of Aristotle. It is likely, as I have there pointed
							out [pp. 271—2], that he was one of the earliest pupils of
							Isocrates mentioned in his <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)nti/dosis</foreign>, § 93. </p>
						<p>Pamphilus, the rhetorician, is mentioned by Cicero, de Orat. III 21. 82,
							together with Corax, in somewhat contemptuous terms, <hi rend="italic"
								>Pamphilum nescio quem</hi>, and of his Rhetoric, it is said,
							(tantam rem) <hi rend="italic">tamquam pueriles delicias aliquas
								depingere.</hi> It is plain therefore that Pamphilus, like
							Callippus, belonged to the early school of Rhetoricians of the age of
							Gorgias and the Sophists, and treated his art like them in a
							‘puerile’ and unworthy manner. Another, and very brief
							notice of him occurs in Quintilian, III 6. 34, a chapter on the <hi
								rend="italic">status</hi> or <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>sta/seis</foreign>; he rejected <hi rend="italic">finitio</hi>, the
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rikh\ sta/sis</foreign>. Spalding in his
							note describes the contents of Pamphilus' ‘art’ from the
							passage of the Rhet., and then discusses, without coming to a
							conclusion, the question whether or no this Pamphilus can be identified
							with a painter of the same name, mentioned in Quint. XII 10. 6, Pliny in
							several places, and Aristoph. Plut. 385, and the Schol. Spalding has no
							doubt that Quint.'s Pamphilus, III 6. 34, is the rhetorician. Spengel,
								<hi rend="italic">Art. Script.</hi> p. 149, note 83, thinks that he
							cannot be the same as Aristotle's, (erat itaque ille P. non ante
							Hermagorae tempora,) in consequence of his acquaintance with <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>, which were of much later
							invention, and the name of them unknown even to Ar. The same doubt
							occurred to myself: but I laid the evil spirit by the consideration that
							though Aristotle was unacquainted with the technical terms and
							classification of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/seis</foreign>, he
							yet was familiar with the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>, which he
							frequently refers to; and the <hi rend="italic">technical
								expression</hi> may belong to Quintilian and not to Pamphilus. Nine
							times the name of Pamphilus occurs in the Orators, (Sauppe, Ind. Nom. p.
							109, ad <hi rend="italic">Orat. Att.</hi> vol. III,) but the rhetorician
							is not among them. </p>

								<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the ground of our belief in it’.
							The argument of the last clause is an exemplification of Topic IX,

							exemplification of the topic in its first and simplest form. </p>
						<p>‘As Androcles of Pitthus’ (or Pithus, whence <foreign

							Cecropis) ‘replied in the charge he brought against the law, to
							the clamour with which he was assailed by them’ (the assembly,

							saying “the laws require a law to correct them and set them
							right” which they thought highly improbable—“why so do

							understands by <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\ dokou=si</foreign> a
							qualification of <foreign xml:lang="greek">prodiabeblhme/nois</foreign>,
							to express the unexpected, apparently unreasonable, nature <pb n="289"/>
							of the calumny or suspicion, which seems to be quite unsuitable to the
							character and circumstances of the object of it: “quae tamen nullo

							extremely well with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">parado/cou</foreign>
							following, and this reading and explanation is deserving at all events
							of consideration. It supposes <hi rend="italic">only one</hi> case to be
							contemplated, that of <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi> suspicion and
							consequent calumny. Vater on the contrary thinks that there are <hi
								rend="italic">two</hi> cases intended, direct calumny, and suspicion
								<hi rend="italic">for any other reason;</hi> and that this requires
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\ dokou=si</foreign>. His transl. is,
							“Homines significantur, qui propter calumniam vel alia de caussa

							suppose his meaning to be what I have said. In this case we must
							understand <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)dikh=sai</foreign>, or something
							equivalent, after <foreign xml:lang="greek">dokou=si</foreign>. Spengel,
							in his recent edition, says that Victorius' reading and interpretation
							is refuted by the sense of the passage—which I cannot agree
							with—and that <foreign xml:lang="greek">diabeblh=sqai</foreign>
							must be understood after <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)\
								dokou=sin</foreign>. But what is the meaning of
							‘apparent’ calumny? and how is it distinguished from the
							other? </p>
						<p>There is another point which has hitherto escaped observation, viz. the
							interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ a)nqrw/pois kai\
								pra/gmasi</foreign>. Victorius interprets it as in apposition to
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">toi=s diabeblhme/nois</foreign>,
							‘qui valet ad purgandas aliquas et personas et res,’ which
							at first sight seems the most natural and obvious explanation, and I
							have adopted it in my translation. But then, what are the <hi
								rend="italic">things</hi> that can be calumniated or brought under
							suspicion? One might suppose that it means human actions: but Victorius
							renders it <hi rend="italic">res;</hi> and in fact actions are
							necessarily included in <foreign xml:lang="greek">toi=s
								diabeblhme/nois</foreign>; they are <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							things that are subject to misinterpretation; and therefore there is no
							ground for a distinction between <hi rend="italic">men</hi> and their
								<hi rend="italic">actions</hi>, so far at least as they are subject
							to calumny. I will venture to suggest, though not with complete
							confidence, that we might give the words a different construction, and
							understand them thus, “for the benefit of those who have been
							unjustly—we must in this case read <foreign xml:lang="greek">mh\
								dokou=sin</foreign>, unlikely to be guilty—subjected to
							suspicion, <hi rend="italic">by</hi> men (by human agency, directly) or
							by circumstances” (indirectly; which would be equivalent to
							Vater's second case). At all events it makes very good sense. </p>
						<p>We now come to a still greater difficulty, the interpretation of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> in the example. A^{c}
							reads <foreign xml:lang="greek">diabeblhme/nhs tino\s pro\s to\n
								ui(o/n</foreign> ‘when a certain woman had been brought into
							suspicion with respect to (i. e. as to her conduct or dealings with) her
							son’, which gives a very sufficient sense, but is rejected by
							Victorius as well as Bekker and Spengel and modern editors in general. </p>
						<p>Victorius' rendering—and no other Commentary that I have seen has a
							word on the subject—is as follows; I must give it in his own words
							as it will hardly bear translation. “Ceu cum mater quaedam filium
							subiisset, corporique ipsius corpus suum supposuisset, ut commode eum
							osculari posset, in eo habitu corporis spectata visa est stuprum cum
							adolescente exercere.” <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> is translated literally. <pb n="290"/>
						</p>
						<p>I see no other meaning that can be attached to the words as the text at
							present stands, but it must be observed that <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>u(pobeblhme/nhs to\n au(th=s vi(o/n</foreign> is very strange Greek
							for <hi rend="italic">supposuisse filium corpori suo</hi>, and I do not
							see how it can be justified. The accus after <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>u(poba/llein</foreign> represents not the thing <hi rend="italic"
								>under which</hi> you throw something, but the thing that you <hi
								rend="italic">throw under</hi> something else: and the <hi
								rend="italic">passive</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pobeblhme/nhs</foreign> meaning
							‘throwing herself under’, is possible perhaps, but by no
							means usual, Greek. The ordinary construction of <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">u(poba/llein</foreign> with two objects, appears in
							these examples. The object <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi> is in the
							accus.; the object under which it is thrown is either in the dat. or has

						<p>The general meaning of the whole is, that a mother had been seen in this
							position which she had assumed for the purpose of embracing her <hi
								rend="italic">own son</hi>—which was not known to the
							witness—was accordingly subjected to the suspicion of illicit
							intercourse with him: and we are to suppose further, that her character

							knot). On this sense of <foreign xml:lang="greek">lu/ein,

						<p>A second example is taken from the argument between Ajax and Ulysses in

							of the Thirty, that is, not later than 404 B. C. (he says 405), when he
							must have been about thirty years old<note anchored="true">Je n'en vois

							of Leptines, in B.C. 355.” And this appears to me to be a
							sufficient account of the matter. Thrasybulus' accusation of Leodamas is
							mentioned likewise by Lysias, c. Evandr. § 13, et seq. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to in this accusation and defence, and the
							meaning and intention of the inscription which Leodamas is said to have
							effaced, are not quite clear. The use of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							or character to all future time. But the fact or character commemorated
							might be either good or evil; and in the former case it was the name of
							a public benefactor, in the latter of some signal malefactor or public
							enemy, that was inscribed. It is usual to apply the latter explanation
							to the case here in question, which is probably what is meant; and then
							it seems the story must be this:—At some uncertain time previous
							to the expulsion of the thirty tyrants and their Lacedaemonian
							supporters by Thrasybulus and his friends, the recovery of the city, and

								>Sapiens</hi> (Cato and Laelius), <hi rend="italic">Magnus</hi>
							(Pompey), and <hi rend="italic">Plenus</hi> (<hi rend="italic">?</hi>):
							or where the name is not significant, but suggests a crime—as the
							name Cornelius, in the case of Lentulus, was suggestive of conspiracy
							(for a reason there given). The use of the name recommended by
							Aristotle's topic (which he does not mention) is pronounced, in the case
							of Euripides—who represents Eteocles as attacking the name of his
							brother Polynices, <foreign xml:lang="greek">polu\ nei=kos</foreign>,
								<hi rend="italic">ut argumentum morum</hi>— as insipid and
							tasteless, <hi rend="italic">frigidum.</hi> It is however ‘a
							frequent material for jokes; especially in the hands of Cicero, who

							of the Greek Tragic poets are familiar. It is not to be regarded in them
							as a mere play on words, but they read in the significant name the
							character or destiny of its bearer: and thus employed they have a true
							tragic interest. It is singular therefore that Elmsley, who had
							certainly studied the Greek dramatists with care and attention, should,
							on Bacch. 508, after citing a number of examples, end his note with this
							almost incredible observation, “Haec non modo <foreign

					<p>In the preceding chapter a selection has been given of the topics or special
						classes of enthymemes which are most appropriate and serviceable in the
						practice of Rhetoric: and these are <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ o)/nta
							e)nqumh/mata</foreign>, c. 24. 11, ult., sound, genuine, logical
						inferences. But besides these there are, in Rhetoric as well as Dialectics,
						arguments apparent but not real, fallacious, illogical, which are often
						employed to mislead and deceive. Now, although we are to abstain from the
						use of these ourselves, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) ga\r dei= ta\ fau=la
							pei/qein</foreign>, I 1. 12, it is necessary for the rhetorician to be
						thoroughly acquainted with them, in order to detect them in others and to
						refute any unfair reasoning which may be employed against him, (ibidem): and
						so vindicate the superiority of truth and right to falsehood and wrong. And
						accordingly we have in the following chapter a selection of the most
						prominent rhetorical fallacies, and in c. 25 the solution of them;
						corresponding respectively to the two parts of the de Soph. El. (cc.
						1—15; 16, to the end), which in like manner is appended as a sequel to
						the Topics in which is expounded and illustrated the genuine and artistic
						method of the employment of the dialectical syllogism. On Fallacies in <pb

						(Poste, Transl. of de Soph. El.). Thus the termination <foreign

						in <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(giai/nein</foreign> implies ‘some

					<p>Of these, accent, division (probably including the opposite), and <foreign

						Poet. XXV 18—20. There is a fourth, § 21, <foreign

					<p>Fallacies <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/cw th=s le/cews</foreign>, in the

							argument alluded to being supposed to be well known, and in every one's
							recollection. Schrader thus fills up the argument:—What you know,
							you know in the Piraeus—where the two disputants were
							standing—this is admitted: but you know also that there are
							triremes: this also is conceded, because the respondent knows that the
							Athenians have triremes somewhere; out at sea, or in Sicily, (referring
							to the expedition of 415 B.C.): whence the conclusion, you know that
							there are triremes in the Piraeus. The illicit combination (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">su/nqesis</foreign>) in this interpretation—
							though Schrader does not explain it further—must lie in the
							conjunction of the Piraeus with the knowledge of triremes, to which it
							does not belong in the respondent's interpretation of the question: and
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/kaston</foreign> will be ‘each of
							these two pieces of knowledge, the knowledge of what is known in the
							Piraeus, and of the triremes’. They are both known separately,
							Euthydemus illicitly combines them. </p>
						<p>This seems to be a reasonable explanation of the example <hi

							the same argument in de Soph. El. The triremes and the Piraeus appear in
							both, and both are styled <foreign xml:lang="greek">*eu)qudh/mou

							though he refers to the passage, takes no account of the words <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)n *sikeli/a w)/n</foreign>, which it seems must
							have formed part of it. Victorius has endeavoured to combine both in his
							explanation of the fallacy—I am not at all sure that I understand
							it: I will therefore transcribe it in his own words <hi rend="italic"
								>verbatim et litteratim.</hi> “Tu scis te esse in Piraeo: quod
							concedebatur ipsi (the respondent), ac verum erat. Scis triremes
							Atheniensium esse in Sicilia (miserant enim eo classem ut eam insulam
							occuparent); id quoque non inficiabatur qui interrogatus erat. Tu scis
							igitur (aiebat ille) in Piraeo triremes esse, in Sicilia existens. Qua
							captione ipsum in Sicilia, scire triremes esse in Piraeo cogebatur; cum
							eo namque, scire in Piraeo, coniungebatur triremes esse: a quo remotum
							primo pronunciatum fuerat: ab illo vero, in Sicilia, cum quo copulatum
							editum primo fuerat, disiungebatur: atque ita efficiebatur ipsum, in

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e(/kaston ga\r oi)=den</foreign>:

							statements, existence or knowledge in the Piraeus, and knowledge of
							triremes in Sicily, which ought to be kept separate, are combined in one
							statement, and hence the fallacy: true separately, they are not true
							together. Whether this is a satisfactory version of Euthydemus' fallacy
							I fear I must leave it to others to decide. My principal difficulty is
							as to the mode of transition from the Piraeus to Sicily in the two first
							propositions, which as far as I can see is not satisfactorily accounted
							for. What is there to connect the ‘knowing that you are in the
							Piraeus’, or ‘knowing in the Piraeus’, with knowing or
							being in Sicily? And yet there must be some connexion, apparent at least
							if not real, to make the fallacy plausible. This is nevertheless

						<p>Of Euthydemus, and his brother and fellow-sophist Dionysodorus,
							contemporaries of Socrates, nearly all that we know is derived from
							Plato's Euthydemus. They had studied and taught the art military, <pb
								n="309"/> and the forensic branch of Rhetoric, Euthyd. 273, C. D,
							before entering at an advanced age upon their present profession, viz.
							that of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ristikh/</foreign>, the art of
							sophistical disputation, and of universal confutation, by which they
							undertook to reduce any opponent whatsoever to silence. Many examples of
							their mode of arguing are given in the Platonic dialogue, but
							Aristotle's instance does not appear among them. See also Grote's Plato,
							on Euthydemus, Vol. I., ch. xix. The fallacies are exemplified from the
							dialogue, p. 545 seq. And on Euthydemus and his brother, also
							Stallbaum's Disp. de Euth. Plat. prefixed to his edition of the
							dialogues, p. 10 seq. (Ed. I). </p>
						<p>An example of illicit combination is given in the <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">peri\ *(ermhnei/as</foreign>, the treatise on the
							proposition or elementary combination of words, c. 11, p. 20 <hi

						<p>‘Another example is that one that knows the letters, knows the

								xml:lang="greek">to\ e)/pos to\ au)to/ e)stin</foreign>, contains
							the fallacy. It assumes that the things combined are the same as they
							are separate; which is not true. </p>
						<p>‘And (thirdly) to argue, that since twice a certain amount (of food
							or a drug) is unwholesome, so must also the single portion be: for it is
							absurd to suppose that if two things separately are good, they can when
							combined unite into one bad’. If the two parts together are
							unwholesome, neither of them can be wholesome separately, because the
							combination of two good things can never make one bad, This is a
							fallacious <hi rend="italic">confutation;</hi> of a physician, may be,
							who is recommending the use of a drug. You say that your drug is
							wholesome: now you only administer a certain quantity. Suppose you were
							to double it, you would not say that it was wholesome <hi rend="italic"
								>then:</hi> but if the two parts together are unwholesome, how can
							either of them, the component elements being precisely the same in each,
							be wholesome? two wholesomes could never make an unwholesome. Here the
							undue combination of the double with the single part produces the
							fallacy (so Victorius). </p>
						<p>‘Used thus, it serves for refutation, but in the following way for
							proof (this is, by inverting the preceding): because one good thing
							cannot be (made up of) two bad’. If the whole is good, then the
							two parts, which is not always true. ‘But the entire topic is
							fallacious’: in whichever way it is applied (Victorius). </p>
						<p>‘And again, what Polycrates said in his encomium of Thrasybulus,
							that he put down thirty tyrants: for he puts them all together’.
							This again, which without further elucidation would not be altogether
							intelligible, is explained by two notices in Quintilian, III 6. 26, VII
							4. 44. </p>

						<p>‘Another, the fallacy of <hi rend="italic">accident</hi>’.
							This is not the same fallacy as that which has the same name in the
							Topics, the first of the fallacies <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/cw th=s
								le/cews</foreign>, de Soph. El. c. 5, 166 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
							28; “Fallacies of accident are those that arise from the
							assumption that the same things are predicable alike of the thing itself
								(<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ pra=gma</foreign>, i.e. the logical
							subject, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ u(pokei/menon</foreign>). For
							whereas the same subject has many accidents, it is by no means necessary
							that all that is predicable of the former should also be predicable of
							the latter.” White is an accident, or predicable, of the subject,
							man: it is by no means true that all that can be predicated of man can
							also be predicated of white. The confusion of these, the substitution of
							one for the other, gives rise to the fallacy. The example is the
							following:—A Sophist argues that because Socrates is not Coriscus,
							and Coriscus is a man, Socrates is not a man. Man is the subject, and
							Socrates and Coriscus are both predicates, attributes, or accidents of
							man. And if we substitute ‘name’ for ‘man’ in
							the proposition ‘Coriscus is a man’, the argument vanishes.
							But both the examples here are instances of accident for <hi
								rend="italic">cause</hi>, and not for subject, which is no doubt a
							more suitable application of it for rhetorical purposes. </p>
						<p>The first example is taken from Polycrates' encomium on mice, quoted
							above without the name, § 2. One of his topics in praise of them
							was “the aid they lent by gnawing through the bow-strings.”
							Something similar to this is narrated by Herodotus, II 141 (Schrader),
							but the circumstances do not quite tally. Sennacherib king of the
							Arabians and <pb n="313"/> Assyria invaded Egypt with a great host, when
							Sethos the priest was king. The god appeared to him in a dream with
							promises of succour against the invaders. “A flood of field-mice
							poured over the enemy by night, which devoured their quivers and bows,
							and besides, the handles of their shields, so that on the following day,
							flying without arms, many of them fell,” &amp;c. At all events,
							wherever the incident was taken from, Polycrates meant to praise the
							mice for some <hi rend="italic">service</hi> they had rendered by
							gnawing the bow-strings: now this service was a mere accident: their
							intention was, not to do service, but only to satisfy their appetite
							(Victorius). Polycrates' fallacy therefore consists in assigning as a
								<hi rend="italic">vera causa</hi> what was only accidental. I do not
							see how this can be construed as a confusion of <hi rend="italic"
								>subject</hi> and accident. And so Victorius in his explanation;
							“quia quod casu evenit tamquam propter se fuisset sumitur<note
								anchored="true">This seems to be the true interpretation; Aristotle
								has here left it open by not defining the topic. But if this absence
								of defin, be understood as a tacit reference to the de Soph. El.,
								and we desire to bring the examples here into conformity with the
								explanation of the topic there, we may understand <foreign
									xml:lang="greek">to\ pra=gma</foreign> in that passage, not as
								the logical subject, but as ‘thing’ in general, and say
								that the fallacy of the examples in the Rhetoric lies in the
								substitution of a mere accident for the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>
								in question, i.e. the real thing, the reality; as in that of the
								mice, the accidental <hi rend="italic">service</hi>, for the real
									<hi rend="italic">appetite:</hi> and in Achilles' case, the
								accidental neglect to invite, for the real disrespect that it

						<p>Of the declamations of Polycrates, who has been already twice mentioned

							whereby the absolute or universal, ‘the unknown is

						</p>
						<p>The topic is first defined in general terms, as it appears in the

								rend="italic">special</hi> application to Rhetoric, the paralogism
							of absolute and particular probability. The first, as in the dialectical

						<p>‘This (particular probability, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ti\

						<p>If this were true, replies the objector, Pittacus, one of the seven

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">tekmh/rion</foreign> that is; and
							(fourthly) by signs, universal or particular’ (see on this, I 2.
							16, the two kinds of signs: and the paraphrase of §§
							15—18, Introd. pp. 163—5), ‘whether (the conclusion
							be) positive or negative (so Vict.); and <hi rend="italic">the
								probable</hi>, (of which all these materials of enthymemes
							consist— with the solitary exception of the <foreign

								>probability</hi>, but only the necessity, (of the opponent's
							statement)’. As <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of a rhetorician's
							arguments is more than probable, this can always be done, but in a great
							many cases it is not fair. </p>
						<p>The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">di) e)pagwgh=s</foreign> are put in

							has returned to the original one in his 3rd, whether by mere oversight,

							of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)a/n te ga\r e)/xwmen e(/n ti</foreign>.
							The connexion of the passage thus altered is this: There are two ways of
							meeting and refuting an opponent's example, the rhetorical substitute
							for a complete induction: first, if we have an adverse or contradictory
							instance (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)x ou(/tw</foreign>) to bring

							the great majority of instances are in conformity with his rule
								(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign>), and (which must be

							contend that the present instance (any one of his examples) is not
							analogous, not a case in point, that there is some difference either of
							kind and quality, or of mode, or some other, whatever it may be, between
							the example and that with which he compares it, which prevents its

							which may perhaps have been Bekker's reason for returning to the

							(2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">lektiko/s</foreign>, the style or manner.

							anything to consider in Rhetoric beyond the proofs or <foreign

							as not belonging to the system of Rhetoric embodied in the two
							first— (no one, except Rose, I think, goes so far as to deny the
							genuineness of the book as a work of Aristotle)—but as a separate

							interpolation added to connect the second book with the third. Vahlen,
								<hi rend="italic">Trans. Vien. Acad.</hi> Oct. 1861, pp. 131, 2, has
							again shewn that arbitrary and somewhat dogmatical positiveness which
							characterises his criticism of Aristotle's text. He pronounces, that of

							third book did not form part of the original plan of the work,
							“are to be regarded as genuine Aristotelian.” The promised
							proof of this theory, is, I believe, not yet forthcoming. </p>
						<p>Brandis is much more reasonable, <hi rend="italic">Tract on Rhet.</hi>
								[<hi rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV i.] p. 7,8. He thinks that the
							second and third parts (the contents of Bk. III, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">le/cis</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ta/cis</foreign>) are already presupposed in the conception of the
							art expressed in the preface to the work. (This is certainly nowhere
							distinctly stated, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>prosqh=kai</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ e)/cw tou=
								pra/gmatos</foreign> of I 1. 3 seem rather to refer to the
							exaggerations and appeals to the feelings and such like topics, of which
							the ‘arts’ of the earlier professors were mainly composed.
							Still, <hi rend="italic">the tricks of style</hi>, introduced by Gorgias
							and his followers into their arts, may be included with the others, E.
							M. C). One of the hypotheses suggested by Brandis on the relation of
							this third book to the two others seems to me highly probable. It is
							that the third book— which is in fact complete in itself (E. M.
							C.)—was written earlier than the rest, and before the author had
							arrived at his final conception of Rhetoric in its connexion with Logic;
							and was afterwards appended to the two others, instead of a new treatise
							written specially with a view to them; and this would account for the
							repetitions, such as that of III 17, which certainly are difficult to
							explain, if the third book be supposed to have been written after, and
							in connexion with, the first and second. With regard to the references,
							as in cc. 1 and 10, to one of the preceding books, Brandis thinks they
							might easily have been introduced <hi rend="italic">after the
								addition</hi> of the third to the two others. He altogether rejects
							the notion that any one but Aristotle could have been the author of it.
							(It has in fact all the characteristics of Aristotle's style, mode of
							thought and expression, and nothing whatever which is out of character
							with him: on the other hand let any two sentences in this book and the
							Rhet. ad Alex. be compared, and it is seen at once that the style,
							manner, and mode of treatment are all totally different. E. M. C.)
							Lastly he notes that it is characteristic of Aristotle's writings (this,
							I think, deserves attention) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give a full
							account of the contents of the work at the beginning of it; and such
							omission of style and arrangement was all the more likely in the
							Rhetoric in so far as it was part of Aristotle's theory of the art that
							everything but proof direct or indirect was non-essential and completely
							subordinate. He concludes, “I think therefore that I need not
							retract the expression I ventured on above (<hi rend="italic">Sie ist
								ein werk aus einem gusse</hi>) that the Rhetoric is, more than most
							of Aristotle's writings, a work made at one cast.” <milestone

						details of language, allusion, and such like particulars. This book, by the
						extreme brevity of expression which characterises it, leaving even more than
						usual to the reader's ingenuity to supply, by the consequent difficulty of

						<p>Harris, <hi rend="italic">Philol. Inq.</hi>, Part II, ch. 10, takes this

							means, “as some interpreters suppose, that this power is entirely
							a gift of nature, and in no degree to be learnt: on the contrary he
							expressly affirms that the ‘perception of resemblances’ on
							which it depends is the fruit of ‘philosophy’: but he means
							that metaphors are not to be, like other words and phrases, selected
							from common use and transferred from one composition to another, but
							must be formed for the occasion” [<hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>,
							chap. III p. 277 ult.]. Whatever Aristotle may have said <hi
								rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>, it is certain that what he says in the
								<hi rend="italic">Poetics</hi>, and therefore in this passage which
							is repeated from it, is what Harris has described: the close connexion
							of <foreign xml:lang="greek">par' a)/llou labei=n</foreign> with the
							following <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)fui+/a</foreign> shews this
							unmistakably. Besides this, a remark about borrowing metaphors from
							other people's speeches or writings is not only trivial in itself, but
							here altogether out of place: and if it were not, why should metaphors
							be singled out from all other forms of speech as things that should not
							be borrowed? Is not purloining your neighbour's thoughts or expressions
							or <hi rend="italic">bons mots</hi> equally reprehensible in all cases?
							or may <foreign xml:lang="greek">glw=ttai</foreign> and <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pepoihme/na</foreign> and the rest, all of them be
							‘borrowed’, and metaphors alone excepted? Victorius,
							according to Schrader, renders it, “non licet <hi rend="italic"
								>semper</hi> sumere ipsam ab alio auctore,” which he approves,
							and interprets, that you musn't be always begging or borrowing your
							metaphors from others, when you can and ought to invent them yourself.
							In my copy of Vettori's Commentary [Petri Victorii Commentarii in Opera
							Aristotelis, 5 vols. folio, published at Florence, 1548—1583],
							these words do not occur: the passage is there explained, as it should
							be, of ‘acquiring metaphors’ from any one but oneself: they

							‘invest’ with your metaphor, like an old man with the

								>freshness</hi> implied in the green vegetation and the freshness
							and vigour of old age, and the two are thus brought under a common
							genus. When old age is called the evening of life the metaphor is
							appropriate, because there is a true proportion or analogy; evening: the
							day :: old age: man's life; evening and old age are under a common <hi

						<p>The common <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> or notion which unites <foreign

						<p>Victorius however, and Schweighäuser on Athen. VI 249 F, drag in
							here, wholly as I can conceive beside the point, another sense of
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">*dionusoko/lakes</foreign> in which it was
							applied to the flatterers of Dionysius of Syracuse—of whose filthy
							and disgusting practices Theophrastus (quoted in Wyttenbach on Plut. p.
							53, F) gives some revolting examples—in a double sense, of
							Dionysus and Dionysius: see their notes for the explanation of this. (It
							is supposed by them and Mr Shilleto u. s. to be a joke; if so, it is of
							a very frigid description.) Wyttenbach says (note ad Plut. l. c.)
							“Actores scenici honesto nomine dicebantur <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">oi( peri\ *dio/nuson texni=tai</foreign>, per
							contemptum <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dionusoko/lakes</foreign>”:
							which is no doubt all that is meant here, though he refers to Victorius'
							note, who makes a great deal more out of it. This special sense of
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">texni=tai</foreign> is fully confirmed by
							another passage of Athen. V 198 B describing a magnificent procession of
							Ptolemy Philadelphus (cc. 25—30), <foreign xml:lang="greek">meq'

							for gross and low flattery: “tanquam assentatores eos, non

						<p>Of Bryson, I have collected what is known in <hi rend="italic">Camb.
								Journ. of Cl. and Sacred Phil.</hi> No. v Vol. II pp. 143—6.
							In this dogma of the impossibility of indecent language he seems to have
							anticipated the Stoics—see Cicero's famous letter to Paetus on
							this Stoic <hi rend="italic">libertas loquendi</hi>, u. s. p. 144 note.
								<hi rend="italic">Suo quamque rem nomine appellare</hi> was their
							statement of this ‘liberty’, to call everything its right
							and proper name without shame or disguise, to call a spade a spade, to
							use the language of a Swift or Aristophanes. Aristotle answers Bryson by
							a simple denial of the fact. It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> true that
							there is no difference in the use of words in respect of their moral
							effect upon us; the broad and literal expression presents the
							abomination much more vividly and impressively to the mind, naked as it
							were, than the same notion when half hidden from the view by a decent
							veil which conceals a great deal of its deformity. On this subject of
							plain speaking, besides Cicero's letter to Paetus (ad Div. IX 22),
							already referred to, see Cic. de Off. I 35. 128 where the Stoics are
							again introduced. Cicero takes the moral and delicate side of the

						<p>‘And besides, it is not under the same conditions and circumstances

							deformed (in so far as they are beautiful and the reverse, <hi
								rend="italic">and in no other respect</hi>)<hi rend="italic">:</hi>
							or, if the latter also, at all events in different degrees’. These
							two different effects of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ai)sxrologi/a</foreign> seem to be thus distinguishable. We are
							first told that the use of the broad word is offensive because it
							suggests directly and immediately, paints on the mind a vivid picture of
							the ugly, foul or impure object: nothing is said of any further,
							indirect, associations connected with it, and the bad effect arises
							solely from the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> or vividness of the
							impure or ugly impression. But in the second case the effect of the
							plain speaking and its associations is contrasted with those that may be
							produced by softening the term, or employing one which <hi rend="italic"
								>signifies</hi> the <pb n="33"/> same thing, but suggests an
							entirely different and innocent set of associations. As in the instances
							given by Cic. in de Off. I 35. 128 <hi rend="italic">liberis dare
								operam.</hi> Here all the associations which would be at once
							suggested by the broad, obscene word, are diverted, and another set
							introduced, connected solely with children, as the result of the
							intercourse, and perfectly free from all impurity. In the one case it is
							the mere comparison of strength and intensity that makes the difference,
							in the other there is a difference of <hi rend="italic">kind.</hi>
							‘The fair term and the foul term it is true <hi rend="italic"
								>mean</hi> the same thing, point to the same object, but not in
							respect of beauty and deformity alone simply and solely (<foreign
								xml:lang="greek">h(=|</foreign>), but besides that, there are
							associations suggested by which the one may be invested with a moral and
							the other with an immoral character, either altogether, or at all events
							in different degrees’: <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/mfw
								ga/r...ma=llon kai\ h(=tton</foreign>. An example of these words
							suggestive of unpleasant associations which are willingly avoided by the
							well-bred and refined under the name of <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>ai)sxrologi/a</foreign>, is to be found in Plat. Gorg. 494 c, where
							Socrates is made to apologise to Callicles for shocking him by the use
							of terms such as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ywra=n, knhsia=n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>‘These are the sources from which metaphors may be taken; from

							metaphors—others from their exaggeration of the stately (solemn)
							and tragic (pompous) style: if far-fetched, they are obscure’.
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/rrwqen</foreign>, see on III 2. 12.
							‘As Gorgias, “things (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pra/gmata</foreign>, actions, occurrences, events, business) all
							fresh and raw”’. This certainly is a good exemplification of
							what it is designed to illustrate: it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> obscure.
							It seems, however, to mean nothing more than ‘recent
							events’, events <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, and with the blood
							in them: the metaphor from a beast just killed. It therefore corresponds
							to <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/sfatos</foreign>, ‘fresh’,
							which also stands for ‘recent’. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>pro/sfatos</foreign> is specially applied to ‘fresh
							meat’. See Lobeck <hi rend="italic">On Phrynichus</hi>, p. 375,
							note: examples of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/sfatos</foreign> are
							there given, p. 374. ‘“And these things <hi rend="italic"
								>thou</hi> hast sown in disgrace, and reaped in misery”. For
							it smells too much of poetry’. [Both the extracts probably belong
							to the same context, and may perhaps be combined by rendering them thus:
							‘all was green and unripe (fresh and flushed with sap), and this
							was the crop that you sowed in shame to reap in ruin’. <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">xlwra\ kai\ e)/naima</foreign> possibly refer to
							the green and unripe stalks of corn, with the sap still fresh in them.
							This assumes that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai(=ma</foreign> can be used
							metaphorically of ‘sap’, both coming under the generic
							notion of ‘vital juice’. If so, the metaphor is a
							sufficiently bold one. Thompson (ed. of the Gorgias, p. 179) notes that
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/naima</foreign> (which is the reading
							of Q, Y^{b} and Z^{b}) is ‘well supported, and cannot but be
							right,’ and remarks that while the metaphor of sowing and reaping
							is a mere commonplace, “pallid and bloodless affairs” would
							need apology even from a modern.] </p>
						<p>A metaphor, nearly resembling the first of these two, occurs in Demetrius

							‘selling oneself’, and above all, Alcidamas' ‘mirror
							of human life’, seems to shew a change of taste from ancient to
							modern criticism. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> certainly should object to
							none of these; and the ‘mirror’ in particular has become one
							of the commonest metaphors in our language. The ‘sowing and
							reaping’ appears in Plato, Phaedr. 260 C (see Thompson's note),
							and Aesch. Pers. 821. In Cic. de Orat. II 65. 261 (without comment), <hi
								rend="italic">ut sementem feceris ita metes.</hi> I Ep. ad Cor. xv.

							beareth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring
							his sheaves with him,” Psalm cxxvi. 6, 7. Possibly the antithesis,
							one of Gorgias' new inventions, may have helped to offend Aristotle's
							tastes, and it is the effect of the whole phrase, and not of the
							harmless metaphor alone, that has unconsciously provoked his
							disapprobation: yet the same occurs in the simple psalm. </p>
						<p>[<foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo\n a)nqrwpi/nou bi/ou

							Similes are a thing like that simile which), ‘that which Androtion

							and bite, and so Idrieus was vicious (or savage) when <hi rend="italic"

						<p>Androtion was an Athenian orator, whose name occurs coupled with many
							opprobrious epithets not only in the speech delivered against him (Or.
							22), but also in that against Timocrates in which he is very frequently
							mentioned. He was sent on an embassy with Melanopus and Glaucetes, Dem.
							c. Timocr. §§ 12, 13, alibi, to Mausolus prince of Caria
							377—351 B. C. Idrieus was his brother, and Androtion may have met
							him at his court, and there had the encounter with him which ended in
							the discharge of his simile. The Scholiast on Isocr. p. 4 <hi
								rend="italic">b</hi> 27 (ap. Sauppe, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Nom. ad
								Or. Att.</hi>) tells us that he was a pupil of Isocrates, and the

							Dictionary about the identity of the orator and author—and the
							Scholiast adds that he was also the defendant in Demosthenes' speech <hi

						</p>
						<p>Idrieus was a prince of Caria who succeeded to the throne on the death of
							his brother Mausolus in 351 B.C. See Mr Bunbury's Art. in <hi

							to his brother, and of course prior to his accession to the throne. He
							is referred to again without his name by Demosth. in the speech de Pace,
							§ 25,— this was also delivered in 346 B.C. (Clinton <hi

							also will be Archidamus <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> geometry’ (a

							proportion—will Euxenus be to Archidamus with geometry: i. e. <hi

							common mode of comparison and applied it to the <hi rend="italic">equal
								worthlessness</hi> of Archidamus and Euxenus. It was probably a
							standing joke at Athens. The case may have been something of this
							kind:—Two contemptible fellows, one of them priding himself upon a
							little knowledge of geometry, are comparing or disputing their
							respective merits: “you needn't say any more about the
							matter,” says Theodamas, a bystander, who was listening much
							amused to the discussion, “you are both equal, <hi rend="italic"
								>Arcades ambo</hi>, a pair of fools, only Euxenus is a geometrical
							Archidamus, Archidamus an ungeometrical Euxenus.” </p>

							Aristotle, like Bacon, quoting from memory, and assuming a knowledge of
							the original in his readers, has left out the explanatory part of the
							illustration which is supplied by Plato. Victorius cites Pacuvius, ap.
							Nonium, in Armorum Iudicio, <hi rend="italic">Nam canis, quando est

						<p>‘And that (simile, understand <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							of the evils of democracy by the comparison of it to the undisciplined,
							untrained, turbulent, anarchical, crew of a ship; each of them, though
							utterly without qualification for the charge, ready to dispute with the
							captain the direction and control of the vessel. The passage is referred
							to by Cicero, de Off. I 25. The words quoted by Ar., few as they are,

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">nau/klhros</foreign>—the ship-owner,

						<p>‘And that (<hi rend="italic">sc.</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)kw/n</foreign>, as before) applied to the
							poet's measures, that they are like the bloom of youth without beauty

							faded (worn off, when they have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> it), and the
							other (the poet's measures) when they are broken up, seem utterly unlike

							which are invested with certain ‘colours’ by the poetical

							to the writer on Rhetoric of illustrating his rules and topics from the
							practice of the first of speakers. It has been already noticed in the
							Introduction, pp. 45, 46, and notes, where the cases of supposed mention
							of or allusion to Demosthenes are collected and examined. And this

						<p>I transcribe Twining's excellent note on this passage, which well
							illustrates our present subject. Note 189, p. 446. “Metaphors from
							their nature are in danger of being obscure or forced, though it is
							essential to their beauty and effect that they should be clear and
							apposite. For this purpose a metaphor may be guarded in various ways. If
							the simple substitution of the improper for the proper term would be
							obscure or harsh, the metaphor may be converted into an <hi
								rend="italic">image</hi> or <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi>
							(referring to Demetrius, <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\
								e(rmhnei/as</foreign> § 80); it may be used <hi rend="italic"
								>analogically</hi>, and we may say <foreign xml:lang="greek">fia/lh
								*)/arews</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">fia/lh
								a)/oinos</foreign>; or if that be not sufficient for
							perspicuity—that is, if the meaning be not sufficiently pointed
							out by the manner or circumstances in which the expression is
							introduced— we may join these (<foreign xml:lang="greek">fia/lh
								*)/arews a)/oinos</foreign>), or even add to either of them the <hi
								rend="italic">proper</hi> word itself. There is a fine instance of
							this <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> mode of explaining a metaphor in
							Isaiah li. 21, ‘Thou drunken, <hi rend="italic">but not with
								wine.</hi>’ The same end is often answered by an epithet <hi
								rend="italic">affirming</hi> of the thing <hi rend="italic"
								>expressed</hi> some quality of the thing <hi rend="italic"
								>signified;</hi> thus ships are <hi rend="italic">floating
								bulwarks</hi> [Mason's Ode to the Naval Officers], and the lyre a
								<hi rend="italic">chorded shell</hi>, where Dryden [Song for St
							Cecilia's Day, line 17, <hi rend="italic">Jubal struck the chorded
								shell</hi>,] has made the same use of the affirmative epithet <hi
								rend="italic">chorded</hi> that Theognis did of the negative
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/xordos</foreign> in his metaphorical
							expression for a bow, <foreign xml:lang="greek">fo/rmigc
								a)/xordos</foreign> (comp. Rhet. III 11. 11, and Demetr. <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">peri\ e(rmhnei/as</foreign> § 85, quoted in
							Introd. p. 297). Sometimes the explanatory epithet is itself a metaphor;
							as in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pterwtoi=s a(/rmasi</foreign> (Iph.
							Aul. 251) of Euripides, ‘winged chariots’. Here we have a
							double metaphor: <hi rend="italic">chariot</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
								>ship</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
								>sail.</hi>” <pb n="71"/>
						</p>
						<p>He then concludes with four examples of these privative explanatory
							epithets from the Greek Tragedians, which I have already quoted with
							some others in the Introduction p. 297, in the note on this passage of
							the Rhetoric. Add to these Cephisodotus' ‘parti-coloured
							millstones’, <foreign xml:lang="greek">mu/lwnas
								poiki/lous</foreign>, III 10. 7, by which he meant to represent the
							‘crushing’ properties of the Athenian ‘triremes’
							in devastating the coasts and islands and exacting tribute. These differ
							from millstones in having their sides gaily painted in various colours.
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/pteros fa/tis</foreign>, Aesch. Agam.
							267 (contrasted with <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/pea
								pteroe/nta</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/pteros

								w)|dai=s</foreign>, Herc. Fur. 879, 891, 892. Similarly the Italian
							poet, Guarini, called birds ‘winged lyres’.] </p>
						<p>It remains to notice the <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the
							metaphor, which, according to Victorius, is Trumpet: sound of trumpet
							(anonymous) :: lyre : <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/los</foreign>, the
							music of the lyre (<hi rend="italic">properly</hi> so called). To
							qualify the harshness, throw light on the obscurity, of this improper
							application of the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">melos</foreign>, the
							epithet <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/luron</foreign> “not that of
							the lyre” is added. </p>
						<p>One more remark on privative epithet, which has not been pointed out.
							They have two uses, the one to <hi rend="italic">qualify</hi>, the other
							to <hi rend="italic">contradict</hi>, the substantive they are joined
							with. In the latter case they are not metaphors at all. This is what is
							called the figure <hi rend="italic">oxymoron</hi>, which combines in one
							expression two contradictory notions of which the one denies the other:
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)xqrw=n a)/dwra dw=ra</foreign> (Aj.
							655), an enemy's gifts are no gifts at all; <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							</app>] The fallacy is this. A speaker puts himself into a passion in
							describing some atrocity imputed to his opponent, assuming the tone of
							anger or virtuous indignation, which would <hi rend="italic"
								>naturally</hi> be provoked by the act as described. People always
							sympathize with the expression of emotion, and the audience, knowing
							what it is to be angry themselves, and perceiving by reference to their
							own experience the ‘appropriateness’ of the language, tone,
							and gestures, to the true expression of the passion, draw from this the
							fallacious inference that the speaker must be in earnest, <hi
								rend="italic">as they were</hi> when they were similarly affected,
							and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> that the facts that he states must
							be true: arguing from the truth of the delineation to the truth of the
							fact stated. </p>
						<p>The logic of the fallacy is explained in de Soph. El. c. 5, 167 <hi
								rend="italic">b</hi> 1 seq. It proceeds from the false assumption,
							in antecedent and consequent, that they are reciprocally convertible:
							that if a consequent always follows an antecedent the converse is
							likewise true, and that the consequent in<pb n="75"/> variably implies
							the antecedent as well as the antecedent the consequent. Here, the
							language &amp;c. used <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the ordinary sign of the
							emotion represented, as they themselves know from their own experience;
							and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> usually arise in men as a consequence of
							such facts as those alleged: the antecedent is then falsely inferred
							‘reciprocally’ from the <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>, but
							not necessary or universal, consequent. This may be otherwise
							represented as a confusion between the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>shmei=on</foreign>, the usual and ordinary, and the <foreign

							their political sentiments and such like: as for instance an audience of
							rich and poor, young and old, aristocratic and democratical, must be
							addressed each in a different tone and with different language, suitable
							to their several opinions and prejudices; and (3) what I have called the
								<hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> characters, which are treated only
							in the third book as belonging to style, and are still more important,
							and occupy a larger share of attention in poetry (especially dramatic
							poetry)—and therefore in the Poetics XV—than in the prose of
							Rhetoric. These consist in the accurate representation of <hi
								rend="italic">personal</hi> character, as described by Horace, A. P.
							114 seq. See also the instances given in the parallel passage, III 16.

								xml:lang="greek">toi=s a(rmo/ttousin</foreign> may be connected

							is at all events <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po/krisis</foreign>,
							appropriate action or gesticulation, that may be brought into
							correspondence; and also the mode of delivery may be
							distinguished—at all events for the nonce—from the other
							three. And he adds a similar objection to another perfectly innocent
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign>, in I 15. 28, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">kai\ w(s ou(=tos k.t.l.</foreign>, the sense (as I

							heard his boast that he was able and ready to answer any question upon
							any subject, took him at his word, and asked him what constituted a
							citizen.—This is the constitutional question which gives occasion
							to Aristotle's quotation.—Partly in jest, and partly because he
							was really at a loss, he replied, that citizens were made by
							citizen-manufacturers: as the vessels made by mortarmanufacturers were
							mortars, so those made by the Larissaean-manufacturers were Larissaean
							citizens or Larissaeans: for there were such people as <foreign

							Thessalian city, denotes also some kind of kettle or other
							cooking-utensil. The reply is much the same as if some one being asked,
							What makes a citizen of the town of Sandwich? were to answer, ‘a
							cook, for he is a sandwich-maker’; and is no bad specimen of the
							way in which Gorgias most likely fulfilled his promise of solving any

					<p>On rhythm in Prose. </p>
					<p>In the paraphrase of the Introduction I have already given an outline of the
						contents of this chapter and their connexion, with references and some
						details, pp. 303—306. And on rhythm in general, and its application to
						prose, there is an Appendix (C), pp. 379—392; in which is a full
						account of its original and derived significations in the first part, and of
						its distinction from <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/tron</foreign> in the
						second. The commentary on this chapter will therefore deal principally with
						the details of the language, allusions, and such particulars as require
						explanation, which are omitted in the paraphrase. </p>
					<p>In the fragments of Isocrates' <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign>,
						collected by Benseler in the Teubner series, Vol. II p. 276, we have the
						following, fragm. 4—cited from <pb n="83"/> Maximus Planudes ad
						Hermog. and Joannes Siceliotes—<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/lws de\ o(
							lo/gos mh\ lo/gos e)/stw: chro\n ga/r: mhde\ e)/mmetros: katafane\s
							ga/r: a)lla\ memi/xqw panti\ r(uqmw=|, ma/lista i)ambikw=| h)\
							troxai+kw=|</foreign>. The first of these precepts is in entire
						agreement with Aristotle, § 1; the disagreement of the second with the
						statements of § 4 is equally striking. It seems from what is said of
						Thrasymachus and the paean in § 4, that the subject of prosaic rhythm
						was not included in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/xnai</foreign> of
						himself and the succeeding writers on Rhetoric. It does not appear even in
						the Rhet. ad Alex. Cicero, de Or. III 44. 173, attributes to Isocrates the
						first introduction of ‘numbers’ into prose composition. </p>
					<p>Dionysius de Comp. Verb. c. 25 (p. 197 R.) refers to this chapter of
						Aristotle in support of his observations on rhythm in prose. His own
						opinions on the subject are given, pp. 195, 6. </p>
					<p>References are made by Cicero to this chapter (§ 4 et seq.), de Or. 1
						47. 182, 183, in the course of his dissertation on rhythm, from § 171
						foll. The same subject is treated, Orat. c. LXIII 212 seq. The various
						rhythms heroic, iambic, trochaic, &amp;c. are discussed in c. LXIV, where
						Aristotle's opinions, as expressed in this chapter, are twice referred to,
						§§ 215, 218. In § 214 we have, temeritas <hi rend="italic">ex
							tribus brevibus et longa est, quem</hi> (sc. paeanem) <hi rend="italic"
							>Aristoteles ut optimum probat, a quo dissentio.</hi> Cicero is
						referring to this chapter, from which the other references are taken: and as
						this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> found there, he must be either quoting
						inexactly, from memory, or perhaps confounding Aristotle's opinion on the
						point with that of one of the other rhetoricians whom he mentions, §
						218. There is likewise an incorrectness in the opinion which he there
						attributes to Aristotle, that the paean is, <hi rend="italic">aptissimus
							orationi vel orienti vel</hi> mediae: <hi rend="italic">Aristotle</hi>
						says nothing of the ‘middle’ of the sentence. </p>

							passage, follows the reading of all our MSS <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>*(hrodo/tou *(alikarnassh=os i(stori/hs a)po/decis h(/de</foreign>.
							Which, together with two other inaccuracies of quotation (in the Rhet.),

							writing <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign> for <foreign

							correct form—leads me rather to conclude that the variation from
							our text is due here, as we have already seen in so many other
							instances, to our author's carelessness in quoting from memory, without
							referring to the original. Aristotle was a book-collector, and no doubt
								<hi rend="italic">possessed</hi> a copy of Herodotus. Victorius
							thinks that the reading here is sufficiently justified by the fact that
							Herodotus did actually become a citizen of Thurii, and was so called.
							But the point here to be decided is not whether he was ever so called by
							others, or even by himself at odd times; but whether he did, or did not,
							write himself a Thurian at the commencement of his own history: which I
							deny, and attribute the implied assertion of that fact as a mere
							misquotation to our author himself. </p>
						<p>‘And this is why it is only at the goal that (the runners) pant (or
							gasp) and become faint, because whilst they are looking forward to the
							limit of the race they don't flag before that (i. e. before they have
							reached the goal)’. This, as I have said in Introd. p. 311, note,
							seems the explanation of the illustration which is required by the
							application of it and by the context. The sight of the goal before them,
							the term of their labour, keeps up the racers' spirits and stimulates
							their exertions, so that they neither faint nor fail till they reach it:
								<hi rend="italic">then</hi>
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)kpne/ousi kai\ e)klu/ontai</foreign>, they
							breathe hard, and their exertions being over, their sinews are relaxed,
							they slacken and grow languid. This interpretation, which is opposed to
							that of Victorius (see note u.s.), makes the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>kampth/r</foreign>, which is properly the <hi rend="italic"
								>turning-point</hi> of the <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							It appears from this passage that the Athenians had made a truce with

						<p>Sestos, on the Hellespont, seems from this passage to have been one of

						<p>This corn-store or warehouse is compared to the ‘shopboard’

							stone for the building of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> temple (doubtless

						<p>‘And Isocrates, “to those that flock together promiscuously

								>o(/ti to\ me\n tai=s panhgu/resin e)noxlei=n kai\ pro\s a(/pantas

						<p>‘And the example in the Funeral Oration, that “Greece might

							that died at Salamis, for her freedom and their valour were buried in
							the same grave”: for had he only said “that she might well
							weep for the virtue that lay buried with them”, it would have been
							a metaphor and a graphic touch, but the (addition of) “freedom
							with the virtue” carries with it a kind of antithesis’. This
							really affecting passage, which Aristotle has partially spoiled by
							omission and alteration, runs thus in the original— the funeral
							oration attributed to Lysias<note anchored="true">This speech is
								condemned as spurious by [Dobree and] Baiter and Sauppe [and also by
								Blass, <hi rend="italic">die Attische Beredsamkeit</hi>, I p. 431,
								and Jebb, <hi rend="italic">Attic Orators</hi>, I p. 208. It
								contains some close parallels to the Panegyric of Isocrates and
								would appear to have been written by one of the pupils of that
								rhetorician, from whom Ar. (it will be observed) takes the quotation
								just preceding the present passage]. Let us hear on the other side
								Mr Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> vol. VI [chap. XLVIII] p.
								191, note, “Of (the funeral orations) as&lt;*&gt;ribed to
								Plato and Lysias also, the genuineness has been suspected, though
								upon far less grounds (than that attributed to Demosth.)..... but
								this harangue of Lysias, <hi rend="italic">a very fine
									composition</hi>, may well be his, and may perhaps have been
								really delivered—though probably not delivered by him, as he
								was not a qualified citizen.” In this judgment I entirely
								agree; and it seems to derive some authority from the citation of
								this extract here, as a specimen of pointed style, which shews that
								it was at all events well known to Aristotle and the Athenian
								public, and well remembered, though the author's name is not given;
								perhaps for this very reason, that the authorship of it <hi
									rend="italic">was</hi> so well known.</note>, Or. 2, in Baiter
							and Sauppe's <hi rend="italic">Or. Att.</hi> I 68, § 60: “and
							therefore Greece might well that day cut off her hair over yonder tomb
							(the orator is on the spot, and points to it) and mourn for those that
							lie buried here, seeing that her own (the text has <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign>, <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
							own, the collective <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ella/s</foreign> being
							resolved into its component members) freedom and their valour are laid
							together in one grave”. Aristotle has very much marred the simple
							beauty of the sentence (which if it be not Lysias', is at all events
							quite worthy of him) by his alterations; <pb n="121"/> especially the
							substitution of the frigid, explanatory, <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=|
								tw=n e)n *salami=ni</foreign>, for the graphic <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">tw=|de</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>to/te</foreign> of the original (I here follow Victorius). [The
							context of the original passage shews that the substitution is really a
							blunder, as the reference is not to the Athenians who fought at Salamis
							but to those who died at Aegospotami and elsewhere towards the close of
							the Peloponnesian war.] </p>
						<p>The metaphor lies of course in the word <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>kei/rasqai</foreign>, by which Greece is personified and compared
							to a woman who, according to the national custom, cuts off her hair as a
							sign of mourning—on this custom see Becker's <hi rend="italic"
								>Charicles</hi>, p. 398; comp. Eur. Troad. 141, Orest. 458, Alc.
							515, Suppl. 97, 974, Hel. 1060, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/nqimos,
								penqh/rhs, koura/, kourai/</foreign>. Aesch. Choeph. 6 (Paley's note
							ad loc.), Hom. Il. XXIII. 142, &amp;c. The last two passages shew that
							this custom was not absolutely confined to women, though it was
							especially characteristic of them. In Lysias the personification, which
							is most tastelessly interrupted by the plural <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>au)tw=n</foreign>, is resumed in the next clause, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">w(s dustuxh\s me\n h( *(ella\s toiou/twn a)ndrw=n
								o)rfanh\ genome/nh k.t.l.</foreign> Here Greece becomes a bereaved
							mother. </p>
						<p>‘And as Iphicrates said, “the course of my argument cuts
							right through the middle of Chares' acts”: a proportional
							metaphor; and the “right through the middle” sets the thing
							vividly before our eyes’. This was said by Iphicrates in the same
							case as that which is noticed in II 23. 7 (see note), the prosecution,
							namely, of him and his colleagues Menestheus and Timotheus, together
							with Chares, who were all brought to trial by Aristophon the Azenian in
							355 B. C. on the scrutiny of their accounts, for misconduct in their
							command during the Social war. Sauppe u. s. p. 191, commenting on this
							passage, says “Iphicrates se et collegas accusatos defendens
							exponit quam male Chares rem gesserit. Hoc facturus dixit, iter
							orationes suae ferre per medias Charetis res gestas, <hi rend="italic"
								>quasi de itinere per hostium fines faciundo</hi> diceret.”
							The <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> of the metaphor is this: As a road
							is carried, or an army or expedition marched, right into the heart of an
							enemy's country, so Iphicrates in his defence carried hostility and
							destruction (exposure and censure) into Chares' conduct during their
							joint command. </p>
						<p>‘And the saying, “to invite dangers to the help (rescue,
							remedy) of dangers” is a vivid metaphor’. The author, and
							occasion, of this sentence are alike unknown. I have followed Schrader
							in the translation. To rid yourself of one danger another must often be
							invoked or invited, as a man saves himself from a shipwrecked vessel by
							throwing himself overboard and clinging to a plank. He also quotes
							Florus, I. 17, <hi rend="italic">Fabius Maximus periculosissimum bellum
								bello explicavit.</hi> The metaphor lies in <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">parakalei=n</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>bohqh/sontas</foreign>, which are transferred from men to dangers,
							which are thereby ‘animated’; <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\

								>e)/myuxon</foreign>. <pb n="122"/>
						</p>
						<p>‘And (what) Lycoleon (said) in his defence of Chabrias, “not
							even awed by that symbol of his supplication, the bronze image
							(yonder)”’. Of Lycoleon nothing seems to be known, beyond
							what may be gathered from this passage, that he was an Athenian orator,
							and defended Chabrias in his trial B. C. 366. </p>
						<p>The circumstances referred to are briefly these. In 366 B. C. Chabrias
							was brought to trial with Callistratus, the orator, on a charge of
							misconduct leading to the loss of Oropus. See <hi rend="italic"
								>ante</hi>, note ad I 7. 13. Grote, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi>
							X [chap. LXXIX] pp. 392, 3, and note 3<note anchored="true">Diog. Laert.,
								III 3. 24, says that Plato also was engaged in the defence of
								Chabrias, no one else daring to undertake it. See Grote's <hi
									rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I 128, note i.</note>. Chabrias had
							greatly distinguished himself on a former occasion, described in Grote,
								<hi rend="italic">Hist. Gr.</hi> X [chap. LXXVII] pp. 172, 3, in an
							action near Thebes fought against Agesilaus and the Lacedaemonians, 378
							B. C. Agesilaus “was daunted by the firm attitude and excellent
							array of the troops of Chabrias. They had received orders to await his
							approach on a high and advantageous ground, without moving until signal
							should be given; with their shields resting on the knee, and their
							spears protruded” (Diodorus, XV. 33, Cornelius Nepos, Chabr. c. 1,
								<hi rend="italic">obnixo genu scuto</hi>). “The Athenian
							public having afterwards voted a statue in his honour, he made choice of
							this attitude for the design.” Ib. 173, note 1. This is also
							referred to, the details being passed over, in Dem. c. Lept., in a long
							enumeration of all Chabrias' services to his country, §§
							75—78; <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s a(/pantas *peloponnhsi/ous
								pareta/cato e)n *qh/bais</foreign>, § 76. See also Wolf, ad
							loc. p. 479. 25 (Schäfer, <hi rend="italic">Appar. ad Dem.</hi> III
							168). Lycoleon in his speech points to this statue which stood in the
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign> in sight of the court,
							and taking advantage of the posture of it, which he interprets as that
							of a suppliant, appeals from it to the feelings of the judges, at the
							same time reminding them of the merits of the original. The effect no
							doubt must have been very striking. The <hi rend="italic">metaphor</hi>
							resides in <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(kethri/an</foreign>, which is
							transferred from the suppliant's olive-branch (<foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>e)lai/an</foreign>) to a suppliant attitude in general, implied in
							the posture of the kneeling figure. On the accusative of the object of
							awe with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)sxu/nesqai</foreign>, see note on
							II 2. 22. </p>
						<p>‘For it was a metaphor at the moment (whilst Lycoleon was speaking
							and Chabrias was in actual danger), but not for ever (i. e. so long, and
							no longer; not permanently), but yet perpetually (repeat <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign>, Schrader) before the eyes (vivid
							and graphic): for it is only while he (Chabrias) is in danger that the
							image seems to supplicate, but the inanimate is ever
							animated—“the monument of his deeds for the
							city”’. </p>
						<p>This very obscure sentence seems intended as an explanatory com<pb
								n="123"/> mentary on the preceding extract. It is truly <hi
								rend="italic">obscurum per obscurius</hi>, a masterpiece of
							Aristotelian brevity, and a complete illustration of the Horatian <hi
								rend="italic">brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio.</hi> I follow
							Schrader and Victorius in the interpretation. First he says that there
							is a metaphor: this of course is in the word <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>i(kethri/an</foreign>, as above explained. But the metaphorical
							application of it only continues during the danger of the person
							represented; when that is over, and the suppliant out of danger, the
							statue loses indeed the suppliant character with which it was invested
							for the time by the application of Lycoleon, but retains the posture and
							its associations as “the memorial of his services to the
							state.” (I agree with Victorius in supposing that this is a
							continuation of the extract, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
								u(po/mnhma</foreign> therefore in apposition with <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">th\n ei)ko/na th\n xalkh=n</foreign>. He
							ingeniously suggests an alternative, that it may be a second extract
							from the same speech, <hi rend="italic">alibi in eadem causa</hi>, and
							another example of a pointed and graphic saying.) <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">kinduneu/ontos ga/r...h( ei)kw/n</foreign> is the

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ a)/yuxon e)/myuxon</foreign> of
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ o)mma/twn</foreign>. Comp. c. 11. 2,
							3, a vivid representation gives <hi rend="italic">animation</hi> to <hi
								rend="italic">inanimate</hi> objects. If this explanation be correct
							we must read <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> for <foreign

								>contrasted</hi> with that of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\
								o)mma/twn. dh/</foreign> is retained by all the Edd., but I cannot
							discover any sense in which it is here applicable. It seems also that
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pe/r</foreign> has dropt out in the

								xml:lang="greek">u(pe\r</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s

						<p>‘And, “in every way practising (or studying) meanness of

							>promoting.</hi>’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">meleta=n</foreign>
							being a ‘kind’, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=dos</foreign>,
							of <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)/cein</foreign>, the metaphor is one
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po\ tou= ei)/dous e)pi\
							ge/nos</foreign>, Poet. XXI 7, one of the four kinds of metaphor.
							‘To study’ therefore, which is one kind of the genus
							‘promoting’, is here put metaphorically for the general term
							‘to promote’. And the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> of the
							metaphor lies in the unusual application of ‘study’: a man
							usually studies or takes pains to promote some worthy object, to
							cultivate some virtue: here the object is an unworthy one, a vice or
							defect. This is taken from Isocr. Paneg. § 151, in a note on which
							passage Coraes ingeniously proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>a)skei=n</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)/cein</foreign>
							in Aristotle's comment on <foreign xml:lang="greek">meleta=n</foreign>. </p>
						<p>‘And “that God kindled (lit up) reason as a light in the
							soul”: for both of them shew something (make things clear and
							visible)’. This is a proportional metaphor. As light to material,
							so reason to intellectual objects. <hi rend="italic">Cuius haec verba
								sunt nondum repperi</hi>, says Victorius, and no subsequent
							commentator has supplied the deficiency. </p>
						<p>‘(The peaces that we make are nugatory) for we do not put an end to
								<pb n="124"/> wars (do away with them altogether), but merely
							postpone them’. This also comes from Isocr. Paneg. § 172.
							‘For both of them look to the future (to future results), both
							actual postponement (in its proper sense and application) and a peace of
							that kind’. This therefore is a metaphor from <foreign

								>ei)=dos</foreign>, from one kind of postponement, to another,
							analogous, kind. </p>
						<p>‘And to say “that the treaty is a far fairer trophy than

						<p>The second extract quoted from Isocr. Phil. § 127 requires the

								a)/feton gegenhme/non a(/pasan th\n *(ella/da patri/da nomi/zein
								k.t.l.</foreign>—a flight quite beyond Isocrates' ordinary

							cattle which were devoted to the worship of some god, and left free from
							the ordinary labours of the plough and cart, to roam and graze at large
							in the sacred precincts, the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>te/menos</foreign> of his temple. See Plat. Protag. 320 A, Rep. VI

						<p>The difference between the mere metaphor <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							habitual with Ar., that all intellectual pleasure is due to the natural
							desire of learning, than to <pb n="131"/> his sober judgment exercised
							upon this particular application of it.) Schrader has supplied two
							capital instances of this form of pleasantry: the first is from Cic. de
							Or. II 281, <hi rend="italic">Quid huic abest—nisi res et
								virtus?</hi> Here the listener is <hi rend="italic">misled</hi> by
							the opening of the sentence to expect a very good character of somebody,
							when unexpectedly, after a pause, two words are added as exceptions,
							which convert the expected eulogium into beggary and worthlessness: but
							is it the <hi rend="italic">learning</hi>, the becoming acquainted with
							that fact, however unexpectedly, that constitutes the pleasure or
							amusement that the listener derives from his surprise? A still better
							from Quint. of a dandy advocate, <hi rend="italic">illud Afri</hi>

								fact would give much pleasure.</note>, Quint. VI 3. 24 and 84. This

							for <foreign xml:lang="greek">qra/ttei se</foreign> would be no
							interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">qra/ttei se</foreign>; nor

						<p>The amusement derived from a pun is thus explained by Cicero, de Or. II

							The point of the joke has been always supposed to lie in <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>. Francésco dei Medici, a
							friend of Vettori, suggested to him a solution which he quotes at
							length, that the Persae a poem of Timotheus is referred to, and that we
							should read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pe/rsais</foreign>. But as Buhle
							justly remarks, “non video quidnam in hoc sit <hi rend="italic"
								>faceti.</hi>” Majoragius' explanation, who supposes that
							there was a verb <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pe/rsein</foreign>, of the
							same meaning as <foreign xml:lang="greek">*mhdi/zein</foreign>, <hi
								rend="italic">Persis favere</hi>, is equally out of the question. I
							have looked (for once) into Spengel's commentary, and find that he has
							suggested an analogy with Horace's <hi rend="italic">vin tu curtis
								Iudaeis oppedere</hi>, Sat. I 9.70. The same thought once occurred
							to me, but I abandoned it, in consideration of the <hi rend="italic"
								>form</hi> of the word, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/rsai</foreign>;
							which, though a possible aorist, is entirely without authority. <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pe/rdomai</foreign> is a dep. and has <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">pardh/somai</foreign> for its future, <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">e)/pardon</foreign> for the aorist. The solution I
							have finally arrived at is that the alteration of letters which makes
							the pun, resides in <foreign xml:lang="greek">bou/lei</foreign>. This
							would probably be pronounced nearly, if not quite, like <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">boulh/</foreign>, and the word could be rendered
							‘will you?’ or ‘the Council’: in the <pb n="134"

								<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxh/n</foreign>) of their

								<hi rend="italic">source</hi> not of evil, but of good). Or, as
							Isocrates puts it, that “the command was to the city the beginning
							(or source) of her calamities.” This, or something like it, occurs
							three times in Isocrates. The two similar places, one a mere repetition
							of the other, Phil. § 61, and de Pace § 101, are probably what
							Ar. had (very imperfectly) in his recollection: the third is, Paneg.
							§ 119, which differs more widely from the quotation. </p>
						<p>‘For in both (these cases, or examples) that is said which one
							would not suppose likely to be said by any one, (<hi rend="italic"
								>lit.</hi> which one would not suppose that any one, <foreign

							time) is recognised as true (sound, in accordance with facts, Victorius,

					<p>We now return for the last time to the subject of propriety of style, on
						which in this chapter we have some concluding observations. Rhetorical
						propriety must shew itself in the due adaptation of style to matter; and
						consequently the three branches of Rhetoric must be treated each in its
						appropriate style. We therefore distinguish two kinds of speeches, and two
						styles appropriate to them; (1) ‘debate’, speaking in the actual
						strife or contest of the assembly and the law-court, <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">a)gw-</foreign>
						<pb n="144"/>
						<foreign xml:lang="greek">nistikh\ le/cis</foreign>, and (2) <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">grafikh/</foreign>, written compositions, which are
						confined to the third or epideictic branch: and the first is again
						subdivided into (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) public speaking, popular
						harangues addressed to the assembly, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
						forensic. This is only true in theory: in practice speeches were often
						written by the orators, as Demosthenes and Isocrates, for the use of those
						who were incompetent or unwilling to write and plead for themselves. </p>
					<p>Under the head of <foreign xml:lang="greek">grafikh\ le/cis</foreign> are
						included all compositions which are intended to be read, and consequently
						the whole range of literature, with the exception of speeches which are
						intended to be <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
							>acted</hi>, deliberative and forensic, <hi rend="italic">public</hi>
						and <hi rend="italic">private</hi> orations—such as those of
						Demosthenes. Thus the third branch of Rhetoric, the <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">e)pideiktikh/</foreign>, is made to embrace all poetry,
						philosophy, history, and indeed any <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> on any
						subject whatsoever. The distinction coincides with that of Hermogenes,
							<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ i)dew=n tom. b/. peri\ tou= politikou=

						character of both; being declaimed in public and sometimes with a political
						object (as Lysias' speech, and some of Isocrates'), but that object was
						subordinate, the main consideration being always the display. Isocrates is
						always anxious to impress his readers with the conviction that his speeches

						Rhetoric, he attacks and vituperates upon intellectual, social, and moral
						grounds. Writing before the establishment of Aristotle's threefold division

								>more</hi> suited to speeches addressed to him: no man would

							be more patient, more inclined to listen to, and more influenced by,
							exact reasoning and circumstantial evidence than either of the two
							preceding: the mob of the assembly would not hear them, nor follow them,
							nor listen to them at all: the large body of dicasts would be more ready
							to do so: but most of all the single judge. The last clause of the

							<hi rend="italic">arrangement</hi> he should think fit. And accordingly

								>narrative</hi> such as they describe, or a <hi rend="italic">reply

							is one of Quintilian's ordinary misrepresentations of writers whom he
							quotes. Ar. says nothing here of the <hi rend="italic">prooemium</hi>,
							theoretically disallowing it: though in compliance with the received
							custom he afterwards gives an account of it and its contents). <hi

						<p>In Introd. p. 333, I have given at length from Cic. de Inv. I 19. 27, the
							distinction of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> in its
							ordinary sense and <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>. It is
							here said that the <hi rend="italic">narrative</hi> or statement of the
							case, strictly speaking, belongs (he means <hi rend="italic"
								>necessarily</hi> belongs) only to the forensic branch of Rhetoric:
								<hi rend="italic">there</hi> there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> always
							a case to state: in the declamatory, panegyrical branch, not a <hi
								rend="italic">regular</hi> systematic narrative or detailed
							statement as of a case; in this the <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>dih/ghsis</foreign> is dispersed over the whole speech, <hi
								rend="italic">infra</hi> 16. 1: and, in <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>dhmhgori/a</foreign> equally, there is not universally or
							necessarily, as in the law-speech, a <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>dih/ghsis</foreign>, because <pb n="158"/> its <hi rend="italic"
								>time</hi> is the future, and a narrative of things future is
							impossible: when it is used, it is to recall the memory of <hi
								rend="italic">past facts</hi> for the purpose of
							comparison—which is a very different thing from the forensic
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>. Comp. c. 16. 11. The
							author of the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 30 (31) includes <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign> in the deliberative branch,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">dhmhgoriko\n ge/nos</foreign>; no doubt
							following Isocrates. On <foreign xml:lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>
							see Dionysius Hal., Ars Rhet. c. x § 14. </p>
						<p>The same argument applies to the <hi rend="italic">refutatio</hi>,
								<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ pro\s to\n a)nti/dikon</foreign>, and
							with more force than to the preceding, for in the epideictic branch
							there is no adversary, and therefore can be no refutation of his
							arguments, at least such as those who lay down this division intend:
							though it is true that a panegyrist <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have to
							meet adverse statements or imputations on the object of his panegyric,
							real or supposed. In fact, it is only in the forensic branch that there

						<p>There can be no question that we should read <foreign xml:lang="greek"

						second, c. xv, which analyses the topics of <foreign xml:lang="greek"

							was left him” by his predecessors—very much applauded, as
							Suidas tell us, and “decreed to be read with Homer.”
							Aristotle (Top. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q</foreign> I, ult. <foreign

								*xoi/rilos</foreign>) thinks less favourably of it; and it was
							afterwards excluded from the Alexandrian Canon in favour of the poem of
							Antimachus. An earlier Choerilus was the Athenian tragic poet,
							contemporary with Phrynichus, Pratinas, and Aeschylus in early life; the
							third a slave of the Comic poet Ecphantides, whom he is said to have
							assisted in the composition of his plays; and the fourth, Horace's
							Choerilus, Ep. II 1. 232, Ars Poet. 357, a later and contemptible epic
							poet who attended Alexander on his expedition, and according to Horace,
								<hi rend="italic">incultis qui versibus et male natis rettulit

							prepossessions against him on the part of the judge); and therefore must
							make the removal or refutation of all calumnies or prejudices against

							to ‘set’ the defendant ‘against’ the judges,
							conciliate their ill-will to him) must reserve all that tends to
							prejudice his antagonist for the epilogue (peroration, conclusion), that
							they may better remember it’ (that his accusations may

					<p>The following chapter is a continuation of the preceding on the ordinary
						contents of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>, two of
						which, as we have seen c. 14 § 12, are <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>diaba/llein</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek"

					<p>The same subject is treated in the Rhet. ad Alex. c. 29 (30), at even greater
						length than by Aristotle: and a summary of its contents, with some remarks
						on its moral character, and its connexion with Isocrates, may be found in
						Introd. pp. 441—443. A comparison of this with Aristotle's treatment
						of the subject is altogether in favour of the latter. He had already told us
						that he disapproves of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>,
						as distinct from the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>,
						altogether: but he is obliged, by the practice of his predecessors, and the
						evident importance of the subject, which in spite of its unscientific
						character cannot be altogether passed over in a complete treatise on
						Rhetoric, to give it a place in his system; but it will be observed that in
						dealing with it he occupies at least threefourths of the chapter with the
						topics of the <hi rend="italic">defensive</hi> use of it, confining his
						observations on the aggressive side to two topics in a single section. See
						also especially § 10, <foreign xml:lang="greek">toiou=toi de\ oi(
							texnikw/tatoi k.t.l.</foreign> The reckless and unscrupulous precepts of
						the other treatise present <foreign xml:lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign> in

							<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( tou= diabo/lou te/xnh</foreign>, the art of
						insinuating by whatever means prejudice and ill-will against your
						opponent—merely because he happens to be such, and for no other
						reason—and so <hi rend="italic">prejudicing his case.</hi> There is
						something further on this in c. 36 (37). 46, 47. There is an invective
						against <foreign xml:lang="greek">diabolh/</foreign> in Isocr. <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">a)nti/d</foreign>. § 18. “<foreign
							xml:lang="greek">diaba/llein</foreign> is ‘to set at
						variance’, ‘to make hostile’; and so to inspire ill-will,
						insinuate suspicions, or prejudice a person against another. It applies as a
						technical term to all insinuations and accusations by which one of the
						parties in a case endeavours to raise a prejudice against the other, which
						are to be reflected upon, but do not directly help to prove, the main charge
						or point at issue; and are therefore <hi rend="italic">extra artem</hi>,

						insinuated charges, to remove evil suspicions. Aristotle begins with this,

						<p>The following sentence to the end of the chapter I have done what I can
							to elucidate in the Introd. p. 354. No commentator, except Victorius,
							whose explanation I have there criticized, has bestowed a single word
							upon it; not even Spengel in his recent edition: I suppose he has given
							it up as hopeless. What it seems to me to mean is something of this
							kind—but I think there is most likely some latent corruption.
							‘If there be anything incredible in your narrative, you may
							promise your audience (omit <foreign xml:lang="greek">te</foreign>) to
								add<note anchored="true"><foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\
									ai)ti/an</foreign> a reason in addition, besides the mere
								statement.</note> a reason (i.e. explanation, to <hi rend="italic"
								>account for</hi> it), and a full, detailed, explanation of it as
							long as they please’. <foreign xml:lang="greek"
								>diata/ttein</foreign> is one of the chief difficulties of the
							passage. The only appropriate meaning that occurs to me is to ‘set
							out in order, i.e. set forth in full and clear detail’: <foreign
								xml:lang="greek">oi(=s bou/lontai</foreign> ‘with what, with
							as many details as, they please’. ‘As Carcinus’
							Jocasta, in his Oedipus, is perpetually promising, in answer to the
							inquiries of the man who is looking for her son—(something or
							other, which is left to be supplied by the hearer's knowledge of the
							context: probably, to satisfy him). And Sophocles' Haemon’. This
							last example must be given up as hopeless: there is nothing in the
							extant play which could be interpreted as is required here. And what
							Carcinus' Jocasta has to do with the topic to be illustrated, is not
							easy to see. Carcinus' Medea has been already quoted II 23. 28, where an
							account is given of him in the note. His Thyestes is referred to, Poet.
							XVI 2, and a fault pointed out, XVII 2. And as if to aggravate the
							difficulties which surround the interpretation of this passage, Wagner,
							in his collection of the Tragic Fragments, has chosen to omit this
							reference to Carcinus. </p>

						<p>It is a nice question whether <foreign xml:lang="greek">au(tou=
								e(/neka</foreign> is neuter (as Mr Cope takes it in the <hi

							masculine’ (as he suggests in the <hi rend="italic">note</hi>, and
							as I have ventured to translate it above). The latter is the view
							supported by Victorius: “Qui utitur dissimulatione, sibique semper
							in sermone detrahit, atque aliis plusquam vere concedi possit, tribuit,
							ut ipse oblectetur, voluptatemque ex aliorum stultitia capiat, hoc
							facit. quare sibi servit: contra scurra ridiculus est, et iocos undique

					<p>The book appropriately closes with a chapter on the Peroration: the contents

						thus reducing the divisions to two, as in Cic. part. orat. 15. 52, (1) <hi

						(Volkmann, <hi rend="italic">die Rhetorik der Griechen und Römer</hi>,

					<p>In spite of what is here said about <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>au)/chsis</foreign>, the student of ancient eloquence cannot fail to be
						struck by the quiet character of most of the perorations of the Attic
						orators. Perhaps the tamest of all (to our modern taste) is the closing
						sentence of Lysias Or. 22 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ tw=n
							sitopw/lwn</foreign>) § 22, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k oi)=d'

						sentences of all, in the Greek orations, are calm and tame, compared with
						the rest of their texture, and especially with their penultimate <pb n="218"
						/> portions, which rise to the highest pitch of animation’ (vol. VII,
							<hi rend="italic">Rhetorical Dissertations</hi>, pp. 25, 184; see also

					<p><app>
							<lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pixalkeu/ein</lem>
						</app>] is a difficult word to translate satisfactorily in the present
						context. Victorius dubiously explains it: “explire et quod factum iam
						est cursim festinanterque eo consilio ut concinnes, iterare ac
						repetere.’ It is metaphorically used in Arist. Nub. 422, where
						Strepsiades offers himself (not his son, as Ernesti says <hi rend="italic"
							>Lex. Techn.</hi> s.v.,) to Socrates, as sturdy and tough material for
						him to hammer upon and forge to his purpose, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ll'
							e(/neke/n ge yuxh=s sterra=s...a)me/lei qarrw=n, ou(/neka tou/twn

						anvil, comp. Horace, <hi rend="italic">A.P.</hi> 441, <hi rend="italic">male
							tornatos incudi reddere versus</hi>). At first sight the word might be
						supposed to refer to <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/mnhsis</foreign>, which
						is subsequently explained in the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">polla/kis
							ei)pei=n</foreign>, in which case it would mean ‘to hammer your
						subject down’, ‘drive it home’; but <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">meta\ tou=to</foreign> in § 2 shews that in the
						present section Ar. is only dwelling on the first of the four heads of the
						epilogue, and does not at present touch on <foreign xml:lang="greek"
							>a)na/mnhsis</foreign>, which is reserved for § 4. Consequently we
						must understand it to mean ‘to elaborate’, ‘to finish
						off’, the topics belonging to the first head. It may also mean to
						mould the audience to one's purpose. Brandis in Schneidewin's <hi
							rend="italic">Philologus</hi> IV I, p. 45, points out that his <hi
							rend="italic">Anonymus</hi> read the clause as follows: <foreign
							xml:lang="greek">kai\ meta\</foreign> (not <foreign xml:lang="greek"

					<p>‘Now (in this) you must aim at one of two objects; to represent

							se</hi>, and independent of all other considerations, as times, places,
						and persons—or in default of this, at any rate good to the judges or
