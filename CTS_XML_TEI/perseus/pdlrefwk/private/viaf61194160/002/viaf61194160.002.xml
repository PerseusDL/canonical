<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>THE present publication completes a task undertaken upwards of
twenty years ago, and but partially absolved in 1895 by the
issue of an edition, in the same series, of <title>The Fourth, Fifth, and
Sixth Books of Herodotus.</title> The most obvious difference in
method between the two works is the addition of an <title>Apparatus
Criticus</title> to this volume. That <title>Apparatus,</title> however, makes no
pretence to independent authority. Fully aware that fresh collations
of some of the Codices are desirable, I could have wished
in particular to have had something better and more recent in
relation to the Sancroft MS. than Gaisford<hi rend="sup">3</hi> (1840) to work
upon. <title>Non omnia possumus omnes.</title> I dare not face such
further delay of this publication as was involved in a thorough
collation, and I could not guarantee the results of a perfunctory
reading. If the present work have any special or novel merits,
they will be discovered in some other directions; yet I am not
without a hope that the printed text may prove a convenience,
and the synthesis of the labours of previous editors, presented
by the <title>Apparatus,</title> lack neither interest nor utility for those to
whom these volumes are addressed.</p>
<p><title>Commentary</title> and <title>Appendices</title> may claim to present a good
deal more than a mere synthesis of the labours of others; yet
I despair, even with recourse to an <title>Index Auctorum,</title> of
acknowledging adequately my obligations to previous and contemporary
scholars and historians. I have nowhere consciously
exploited another man's work without acknowledgement; but
<pb n="viii"/>
now and again virtue has peradventure flowed over me from
masters unknown or forgotten. Thirty years have I lectured
and taught in the University upon the topics treated in these
volumes, and have doubtless profited directly and indirectly by
the winged words of fellow-students, at home and abroad: I am
no longer able to father my every thought upon its ‘first and
only begetter.’ Moreover, what scholar has not known again
and again old ideas rediscovered and proclaimed as novelties, in
perfect good faith? It has happened to me also to encounter,
in print or viva voce, points or parallels which I could almost
have sworn were my very own. The jealous scramble for
priority of publication in the well-worked fields of Herodotean
research were a little difficult to justify; and the attempt here
to enumerate items, which I believe to be fresh and original in
my own work, a sorry speculation: so woefully would omitted
articles and unconsidered bagatelles depreciate the claim. I
shall be more than content if the comparatively small number
of readers—all I can hope for—who are capable of a judgement
in the matter, find my work serviceable and interesting. It is
addressed to the friends of Hellenic studies: except for that
appeal, it has been accomplished through long years, amid many
conflicting duties, and latterly under some physical disabilities,
purely for its own sake, and as a debt of honour—<foreign rend="ital">almae Matri
nutricia</foreign>—to the University of Oxford, which in according me
a quasi-professorial position upon her staff, laid silently upon me
(as I understood) an obligation to diminish, so far as in me lay,
the reproach—perhaps a trifle antiquated—of sterility, still too
often levelled against her resident sons.</p>
<p>Somewhat full analyses, or <title>Tables of Contents,</title> are prefixed
to the <title>Introduction</title> and to the <title>Appendices</title> in these volumes;
but, without recourse to the <title>Indices,</title> it will not be possible for
those who consult the work to assemble all the references bearing
upon the almost innumerable topics discussed. In particular,
the argument of the <title>Introduction</title> is constantly enforced, and
supplemented, in <title>Commentary</title> and <title>Appendices,</title> and it is only,
<pb n="ix"/>
for example, in Index IV. that the fuller references for ‘the
priority of the last three Books’ in Composition, or the
hypothesis of the ‘three Drafts,’ and so forth, are to be found.
I fear, indeed, that I have not always succeeded in avoiding
unnecessary repetitions: at least one such case of superfluity
affronts me in the parallel passages on the Hellespontine Bridges.
The passage in the <title>Commentary</title> was printed first; and yet it
seemed impossible, when the Bridges loomed up in the <title>Appendix,</title>
to be content with a simple reference back to the Commentary,
leaving an obvious lacuna and inconsequence in the sustained
argument of the section: but I would fain hope that this case
is all but unique. Exception may be taken to my inconsistencies
in transliterating proper names, and to discrepancies between the
spelling in my text and that upon some of my <title>Maps.</title> Such
objections in part affect the mystery of book-making, and your
author is hardly quite a free agent, or responsible: in part, such
discrepancies, which never leave the real objective in any doubt,
seem to me almost negligible quantities. If that is not enough,
I will make bold to say that, had I the whole work to do over
again, I would be, if you please, even more pedantic in such
matters, and enforce a transliteration of Greek proper names as
exactly as Grote and Browning did: ‘Herodotus,’ though I have
adhered to it, is an abomination to me, and ‘Thucydides’—
which the Anglo-Saxon pronounces ‘Theusydidese’—an absurdity.</p>
<p>But perhaps what might most loudly call for an apology is
the audacity of my dedications. I have ventured to inscribe the
first volume of this <title>Ex voto</title> to the three distinguished Editors
on whose foundations my <title>Apparatus</title> is in the main erected; and
with the second volume I have dared couple the names of three
distinguished fellow-countrymen of my own, all brilliant expositors
of old Greek life and letters. They will not, I hope,
be shocked if I say in defence that Herodotus had in him the
makings of a very decent Irishman, just as Thucydides might
pass, of course, for a typical John Bull. But, as I may call them
in some sort, all three, friends of long standing, they will forgive
<pb n="x"/>
me when they find their names—that is, their good examples
and courageous spirit—associated with my work. Had Sir
Richard Claverhouse Jebb been still within hearing of such an
<title>Ave,</title> I might have claimed a like indulgence for the unauthorized
use of his name.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge with cordial thanks the care and
acuteness with which an old friend and former pupil, Mr.
George Buckland Green, now a Master at the Academy School
in Edinburgh, has assisted me in the correction of the proofs of
this work. My gratitude is due to Messrs. R. &amp; R. Clark,
of Edinburgh, and to their accomplished and learned staff, for
the accuracy and unfailing courtesy with which the lengthy
business of printing these volumes has been conducted, and to
the House of ‘Edward Stanford,’ for the pains bestowed upon
the maps in the second volume. Last, and not least, I desire to
record my grateful sense of the patience and kindness with
which my publishers, and in especial Dr. George A. Macmillan,
have endured a long-drawn engagement, from which neither
publisher nor author can expect to derive pecuniary advantage!</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
<div type="section" n="1">
<head>Unity of the last three Books of Herodotus</head>
<p>The seventh, eighth, and ninth Books, or ‘Muses,’ constitute
a distinct part, or section, of the work of Herodotus. They form
a whole in themselves, separate from the preceding Books, and
closely continuous and related with each other. Though comprising
in actual substance a full third of the work, the narrative
in this volume presents but a single short war, of two campaigns,
and is free for the most part from digressions and excursuses, such
as bulk so large in the earlier Books. The chronological conditions
of the continuous narrative are complete in a dyad, or at most
in a decade, of years. A somewhat larger demand is made in the
geographical interest; but the requirements of the narrative, or of
the composition, are satisfied without serious interruption of the
main theme, and geography rarely, if ever, in these, as often in the
earlier Books, becomes an end in itself. Nor is the story proper
much neglected, or often deserted, for purely narrative digressions,
stories within or beside the story of the war; if anecdotes or
tales are brought in which break the strict sequence or continuity
of the main narrative, yet they have mostly some bearing upon
the subject in hand, as antecedents, consequents, or illustrations.
There is, indeed, as compared with the preceding Books, a remarkable
closeness in the texture and argument of this last trio.
The subject proper comprises the story of the invasion of Greece
by the Persians, the ‘Barbarians,’ under Xerxes, a well-defined
and well-understood episode, or climax, to which Thucydides, for
example, afterwards applied the title <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ *mhdika/</foreign>, ‘the war with
the Mede,’ as a technical term.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p><cit><bibl n="Thuc. 1.23.1">Thucyd. 1. 23. 1</bibl> <quote xml:lang="greek">tw=n de\ pro/teron

<pb n="xvi"/>
subject Herodotus undertook to cover a good deal of ground, and
to organise a large mass of material; the result is a treatment
upon a scale for which the preceding six Books have afforded no
parallel. How curt the stories of the Marathonian campaign, of
the first expedition of Mardonios, of the six years' struggle with
Ionia in revolt, compared with the scale on which the invasion
under Xerxes is delineated! Even the invasion of Europe by
Dareios in person, which might more nearly challenge comparison,
is dwarfed beside the story of ‘the great Expedition,’ much more
the other and earlier adventures, of Greek against Greek, or Greek
against Barbarian, or of Barbarians among themselves, whereof
the former Books of Herodotus have preserved a memory. So
great, indeed, is the contrast in scale, method, and interest
between the last three Books of Herodotus and the first three,
that it would be difficult to relate these two sections of the work
to each other, or to believe them parts of one whole, governed by
one single plan and conception, if accident had divorced them, or
if, say, the middle portion of the work, Bks. 4, 5, 6, like the
middle Books of the <title>Annals</title> of Tacitus, had been lost in the lost
archetypal manuscript.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. my edition of Books IV.-VI.
(1895), Introduction, § 4 (vol. i. pp. xii.
ff.).</p></note> The distinct and independent unity of
the last three Books is further accentuated by the clear stylistic
break between the sixth and seventh Books on the one hand, and
the total absence of any stylistic break between the seventh and
eighth Books and between the eighth and ninth Books upon the
other. Nowhere, indeed, is the existent division into Books less
justified than in the last section of the work of Herodotus.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. the <title>Oekonomie des Herodotischen
Werks</title> in A. von Gutschmid's <title>Kleine
Schriften,</title> iv. (1893), pp. 183 ff., where
the whole work is divided into twelve
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ao/goi</foreign>, of which the last three comprise,
indeed, the last three Books, but with
new divisions (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ao/gos i'</foreign> = VII. 1-177;
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ao/gos ia'</foreign>=VII. 178-VIII. 129; <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ao/gos ib'</foreign>
=VIII. 130-IX. 122).</p></note> The
break between Book 7 and Book 8 seems indeed inevitable from
the otherwise unruly dimensions of the former, and a distinct
pause is marked in the narrative, after Thermopylai, by the
record of the erection of monuments, subsequently, upon the spot,
and by the author's clear severance of the operations by sea off
Artemision from the operations by land at Thermopylai. This
justification or call for a convenient division is emphasized by the
Spartan anecdote, probably a later addition, and hardly from the


<pb n="xvii"/>
author's pen, with which the Book now concludes; but neither
in the original nor in the final draft of this section or volume of
the work was there any grammatical or stylistic break or pause
between our Book 7 and our Book 8. The same observation is
exactly true of the break between Books 8 and 9; grammatically
the breach is ignored, and materially it is purely artificial, not to
say unnatural. Least of all do the existing divisions correspond
to a chronological skeleton, such as underlies the division of the
work of Thucydides into Books.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 The second, third, and fourth Bks.
of Thucydides each contain the annals
of a <foreign rend="ital">triennium</foreign>: the eighth, ninth, and
tenth might have shown almost the
same scheme, had the work been completed,
not by Xenophon but by the
author. The division into Books is, of
course, posthumous.</p></note> The action of the last forty
chapters of the seventh Book is synchronous, so to say, with that
of the first twenty-five chapters of the eighth Book, just as the
events narrated in the first half of the ninth Book are <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign>
synchronous with the events narrated in the second half. If the
‘Book of Artemision’ was to be separated from the ‘Book of
Thermopylai,’ so might the ‘Book of Mykale’ have been parted,
and with more justification in the nature of things, from the
‘Book of Plataia.’ The purely artificial or arbitrary nature of
the divisions, plainly dictated by merely external convenience, is
a witness to the essential coherence of the record as a whole.
This coherence is further attested by the observation of the overlaps
between Book and Book: thus the narrative of the naval
operations is taken up at the opening of Book 8 from Book 7
c. 196, and again in Book 9 c. 90 from Book 8 c. 132; what
would otherwise have been purely a naval story has been
interrupted, we may say, in the one case by the story of
Thermopylai, in the other by the story of Plataia. No other
equal portion of the work of Herodotus exhibits so remarkable a
coherence, continuity, and freedom from digression, interruption,
or asides as this the third and last volume, or trio, of Books.
Other particular and considerable portions of the work do indeed
reveal an equal closeness and unity of structure, the Egyptian
<title>Logoi,</title> the Skythian <title>Logoi,</title> the Libyan <title>Logoi,</title> each severally; but
the size and separateness of the Egyptian <title>Logoi,</title> for example,
destroys by its position the unity and continuity of the MedoPersian
history into which it has been inserted, and the smaller
but substantial unities of the Skythian and Libyan <title>Logoi</title> have

<pb n="xviii"/>
combined to form a unity in Book 4, which has destroyed
apparently for most students and editors the inner continuity of
Herodotus's narrative from the passage of the Bosporos by Dareios
to the battle of Marathon, and its immediate sequelae. Moreover,
the bewildering kinematograph of Hellenic histories developed in
Books 5 and 6, and especially in the latter, throws into all the
greater relief the comparative simplicity and unity of interest and
story in Books 7, 8, 9. If that unity and that simplicity are
not conspicuous to a fault, the result is due in the first place to
the dividing and conflicting interest of actions conducted synchronously
on land and on sea, and not always in sight of each
other; it is due in the second place to the ubiquitous methods of
the author, who is equally at home among invaders and invaded,
and narrates with equal confidence deliberations and doings in
the Persian court and camp on the one hand, and combinations
and conduct among the Greeks on the other, passing from sea to
shore and from side to side with a regularity which amounts
to a principle, or at least a trick, of composition.</p></div>
<div type="section" n="2">
<head>Justification of the existing subdivisions</head>
<p>Granted, however, that for practical purposes a subdivision
of the third volume, or section, of the work was desirable,
the existing divisions are sufficiently justified by the structure of
the narrative and the nature of the subject.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 The division of the Herodotean
work into nine Books was probably made
in Alexandria; cp. <title>Herodotus IV.-VI.,</title>
Introduction, § 2 (vol. i. p. x).</p></note> The story falls
almost spontaneously into the account of the antecedents and
preparations for the great undertaking, as well on the offensive
side as on that of the defence. The scenes of these two parallel
streams of narrative and description are necessarily laid apart, on
the Asiatic and on the European mains, until the invaders and
the invaded are set face to face, by sea and land, at Artemision
and Thermopylai. From that point onward the stories of the PersoHellenic
war might flow in a single channel but for the double
character of the operations, maritime and terrestrial. Thus,
to the account of the preparations <foreign rend="ital">ex parte Persarum,</foreign> which
carries Xerxes and his forces to the threshold of Greece, uninterrupted
by any reference to purely Greek affairs, succeeds
the account of the contemporary preparations of the Greeks to
meet the impending danger, down to the definitive occupation of
their first line of defence. At this point the two stories coalesce

<pb n="xix"/>
into the narrative of the struggle for Thermopylai, with the
capture of which post the seventh Book virtually concludes.
Four or five subjects, in the main of continuous character, fill the
eighth Book—the story of the naval operations off Artemision,
the advance of the Persians through central Greece, including the
attempted sack of Delphi and the actual capture of Athens, the
naval movements culminating in the battle of Salamis and its
immediate sequels on sea and land, the retirement of the King
and his land-forces, and certain proceedings of the winter and
spring antecedent to the second campaign. A minute analysis of
this portion of the work will reveal a more open texture, a more
composite structure, a certain embarrassment on the author's
part in dealing with his materials, an appreciable increase in
digressional and episodic elements, a greater complication than
is observable in the construction of the seventh or of the ninth
Books; but, for all that, the structure of Book 8 is simple in
comparison with Books 5 and 6, or even Book 3. The ninth
Book is the simplest, as it is the shortest, of all the conventional
divisions: it holds but two compartments, the narrative of the
operations of the armies in Europe, culminating at Plataia; the
narrative of the naval operations culminating on the Asian side
at Mykale, with a sort of corollary in each case respectively, the
siege of Thebes, the siege of Sestos. Throughout this whole
volume comprising these three Books the narrative flows on
almost unbroken, except by those changes of scene and time
which the nature of his subject itself or the sources of his knowledge
imposed on or at least suggested to the author. To
emphasize more fully the continuity and coherence of this
narrative, to specify such digressional passages as do occur, to
exhibit the structure and contents of these Books in somewhat
greater detail, there is here subjoined a more detailed Analysis,
which follows the clear divisions and self-advertisements of the
work itself, with explicit references.</p></div>

<head>Characteristic and Analysis of Bk. 7</head>
<p>After a short Introduction (cc. 1-4), which serves to
explain the delay in the Reinvasion of Hellas after Marathon
by various considerations—the need of fresh levies, the revolt of
Egypt, the death of Dareios, and the accession of Xerxes—the
<pb n="xx"/>
seventh Book, as we reckon it, falls almost self-evidently into
two, or into three, main parts. The first part deals with Persian
history, and records the antecedents of the invasion, and the
advance of the king to the gates of Greece (cc. 5-131). Whatever
the Sources underlying this part of the narrative, the story
is told, so to speak, from the Asiatic point of view: it is not
primarily Greek history. We may erect the historian's account
of contemporaneous politics and preparations among the Greeks
into a second and co-ordinate Part (cc. 132-178), though in
bulk it amounts to little more than half the size of the previous
Part. An equal section of the Book will then remain to make
a third Part, comprising the story of the actual outbreak of
hostilities, and of the conduct of the war down to the capture of
Thermopylai (cc. 179-239). These two Parts taken together
as nearly as possible equal in bulk the first Part, and as the
material contained in them is manifestly Hellenic in origin and
interest, some analysts might prefer to divide the Book into two
equal Parts (I. 5-131; II. 132-239). In either case, whether
making a dual or a triple division, we recognize the principle of
balance, of parallelism, of symmetry in the composition, which
may have helped to determine the later division into Books—a
division skilfully made in accordance, on the whole, with the
inner structure of the work itself. Throughout the Book, in its
dual or triple divisions, the narrative proceeds with little
interruption, or digression, save what is immediately germane to
the subject. The excursus on Sicilian history (cc. 153-156)
most nearly approaches to a veritable departure from the
argument; yet even this departure, though probably a later
insertion, like many smaller passages, from the author's own
hand, rather enhances than disturbs the main interest by a
suggestive aside. The still minuter Analysis which follows may
exhibit the structure and relations of the main Parts of the Book
more intelligibly, and may also guarantee the observations above
formulated upon the closeness of the argument, the continuity
of the treatment.</p>

<p>The text, so far analyzed, though obviously saturated in
Greek <foreign rend="ital">media,</foreign> is yet in the main Persian history, an account and
description of the project and movement for the conquest of
<pb n="xxiii"/>
Hellas wholly from the Persian side. A great deal of the
material, for example the geographical notes and descriptions,
which are copious and precise, is presumably of purely Hellenic
provenience. The origin of various anecdotes, <foreign rend="ital">bons mots,</foreign> speeches,
and similar items is disputable; and even the scenes laid in
Susa have a suspiciously Greek colour. But, irrespective of
origin, and from the simple standpoint of the analyst, the subject
matter so far is all, with trifling exceptions, so to speak, Persian
history, a description of Persian institutions, affairs and persons.
The exact point to which it is worth while to carry analysis of
this kind may be disputed: the Analysis above given is over
minute for some purposes, and not minute enough for others;
but, at any rate, on the general character and main divisions of
the subject matter there is not much room for discussion. Before,
however, this obviously Persian <title>Logos</title> makes way for a no
less obviously Hellenic <title>Logos,</title> its counterpart and parallel, we
have to face a passage of ambiguous and transitional character.
It is a medley of complex and even miscellaneous content.
The historical value and provenience of the items are almost as
much in doubt as their occurrence just in this place is perplexing
from the point of view of the literary composition. The problems
raised by this passage cannot be resolved until the questions of
the Sources, Composition, and Genesis of the work have been
stated and answered; meanwhile the passage has been reckoned
to the first main division of the Book, because a fresh section
clearly begins with c. 138.</p>
<p>Appendix to Part I. (of Book 7).</p>
<p>P. 1. The king's visit to Tempe }</p>
<p>2. The geography of Thessaly }cc. 128-130.</p>
<p>3. The pause in Pieria, and the return of the Heralds, c. 131 (cp. c. 32).</p>
<p>G. 4. List of medizing Hellenes: the oath of the Patriots, c. 132.</p>
<p>5. Why no heralds were sent to Athens and Sparta, c. 133.</p>
<p>6. Story of the Wrath of Talthybios, cc. 134-137.</p>
<p>This Appendix may be taken to ease the scene-shifting
between Part I. and Part II. in this Book; but Herodotus does
not by any means employ such transitions as essential in his
composition, and the items contained in this Appendix generate
each and all grave historical difficulties, the last item, the
story of the Wrath of Talthybios, involving the fundamental
<pb n="xxiv"/>
problem of the date and history of the composition. Unless the
whole Book was written after the outbreak of the Peloponnesian
war, the close of this passage at least must have been an insertion,
among the very last, from the author's own hand. It is, indeed,
expressly marked as a digression by his own words. It will
hereafter (cp. § 9 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) be shown that the stratification of this
passage is probably the result of more than one later deposit, and
that a somewhat complex theory of the composition of the work
must be invoked in order to solve the given problem.</p>
<p>To resume analysis:—</p>
<p>Part II. PREPARATIONS OF THE GREEKS, cc. 138-178.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Greek states, c. 138.</p>
<p>The case of Athens, cc. 139-144.</p>

<p>The plan adopted: to defend Thermopylai, cc. 175-177.</p>
<p>Topography of Artemision-Thermopylai, c. 176.</p>
<p>Occupation of the line, c. 177.</p>
<p>Delphic oracle, on the wind, c. 178.</p>
<p>On this whole passage three observations may at present
suffice. First, (1) the passage on Sikelian affairs (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ a)po\
*sikeli/hs</foreign>) resolves itself clearly into four sub-divisions: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>)
Origin and rise of Gelon, cc. 153-156; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Interview of the Greek
ambassadors with Gelon, cc. 157-162, a passage containing six
speeches, <foreign rend="ital">toti&lt;*&gt;em verbis</foreign>; (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) The mission of Kadmos, cc. 163, 164;
(<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) The Sikeliote variant on the main theme, cc. 165-167.
Again, (2) the passage on Krete contains an explicit digression
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">parenqh/kh</foreign>) in a note on the defeat of the Tarantines by the
Messapian Iapygians (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ kata\ *(rhgi/nous te kai\ *taranti/nous</foreign>).
Finally, (3) the passage on Thessaly (cc. 172-174) is of a special
significance, as it records the decision of the Confederate Greeks
in the first instance to include Thessaly in their line of defence,
and the actual despatch of a large force to realize this plan,
adopted only to be abandoned. The military and historical
<pb n="xxv"/>
aspects of this story must be reserved for discussion (cp.
Appendix IV. §§ 6, 7). From this analytical point of view it is
worth while to observe that the projected defence of Thessaly
makes the king's encampment at Therme, c. 127, doubly suitable
as the point at which to mark the finale of the first section
of the Book, which carries the Persian from the capital of his
Empire to the natural frontier of free Hellas.</p>
<p>The story of the mere antecedents and preparations of the
struggle is herewith ended, and the story of the actual operations,
the invader now in touch with the invaded, is about to begin.
But this fact rather complicates than simplifies the practical
problem of composition for our author. He has henceforward to
deal with a double series of synchronous and more or less interrelated
operations, those by sea and those by land, and he has to
show himself equally at home among the Greek as among the
Persian forces. He solves the problem in the main henceforth
by a regular scene-shifting from sea to land, and from land to
sea, coupled with an equally regular but more rapidly recurring
alternation of the standpoint from the side of the Persian to the
side of the Greek, and from the Greek back to the Persian side.
When things come to close quarters, to actual blows, the story
is told mainly from the Greek standpoint, as correspondents or
reporters attached to Greek forces—had such fire-bringers
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">purfo/roi</foreign>) been then procurable—might have told the story.
The results of this method are not altogether happy. The
operations by sea and by land are divorced, at least in some
situations, unduly from each other, by the literary practice; the
literary result itself obtains, for considerable passages, somewhat
of the mechanical beat of a pendulum; and the crucial or
climacteric moments are nevertheless presented in somewhat
one-sided a fashion. Yet the superficial aspect of the narrative
is not deficient in variety. Herodotus is so rich a master of
anecdote, asides, anticipations, reflexions, anachronisms, and all
the ancillary devices of story-telling, that his work never presents
the bald mechanics of a chronicle, the bare bones of mere
annalism. In the subsequent tables the alternations above
described will be indicated by appropriate letters. P=Persian
side; G=Greek side; A=Army; N=Navy. An H indicates
some extensive or noteworthy reflexion by the historian; other
digressions, or excursuses, are marked as such.</p>

<p>The bald analysis of the passage displays a great variety of
materials, and presumes a large number of sources laid under
contribution for the composition of so complex a record. A
chronological indication at the close of c. 233 suggests that
‘the case of the Thebans’ is a late addition, unless indeed the
whole composition is to be dated to the opening years of the
Peloponnesian war. The Colophon, or pause, gained by the insertion
of an anecdote, such as that on Gorgo, is entirely in
Herodotus' manner; but only too good reason can be found for
doubting the authenticity of the passage, which in any case will
hardly have formed a constituent of the first draft of the work.</p></div>
<div type="section" n="4">
<head>Characteristic and Analysis of Bk. 8</head>
<p>The eighth Book deals predominantly, though not quite
exclusively, with naval affairs. Except for (1) the advance of
the Persian army through central Greece (cc. 26-39), including
the assault on Delphi; (2) the siege and capture of the Athenian
Akropolis (cc. 51-55); (3) the notice of the fortification of the
Isthmos by the Peloponnesians (cc. 71-73); (4) the retreat of
Xerxes and Mardonios to Sardes and to Thessaly respectively
(cc. 113-120); (5) the operations of Artabazos in the north
(cc. 126-129); (6) the mission of Mys to the oracles (cc. 133-135);
and (7) of Alexander to Athens (cc. 136-144), the affairs
narrated concern the fleets and the operations at sea, and the
scenes may be said to be all laid on the water. Even where for
a few other moments we land, with the author, as on the shore
of Salamis (c. 49 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ktl</foreign>.), or the plain of Thria (c. 65), at Phaleron
(c. 67), or for the award of the <title>Aristeia,</title> and so forth (cc. 121-125),
the episodes are all closely related, as antecedents or
consequents, to the naval operations. Thus, as a whole, the
eighth Book has a certain unity in itself, arising from the predominantly
naval interest, until this interest is lost at the close
(cc. 133 ff.). Chronological coherence, too, the narrative possesses
for the greater part of the Book, albeit this element of unity
becomes obscure and problematic, with the winter following the
<pb n="xxviii"/>
battle of Salamis (after c. 121). On the whole, however, the
Book forms a sort of unity in itself, by its subject and the
chronological sequence of the narrative, and has, after a fashion,
a beginning, a middle, and an end. The middle is clearly supplied
by the stories of Salamis; and taking Salamis as the key
to our analysis, the Book may be divided into three main
sections—</p>
<p>I. Before Salamis, cc. 1-39.</p>
<p>II. Salamis, cc. 40-96.</p>
<p>III. After Salamis, cc. 97-144.</p>
<p>Of these sections the first is considerably the shortest, and the
third the longest; but it may be worth while to observe that,
if from the third section the latter portion (cc. 133-144) be
detached as essentially belonging to the operations of Mardonios
and the land forces in the coming campaign, the middle and
core of the Book would have before and after it two passages,
or sections, of almost exactly equal length (cc. 1-39, 97-132),
and would form in that case a very nicely balanced whole.</p>
<p>The first part or section of the Book further subdivides very
clearly into two distinct sub-sections, or main chapters:—</p>
<p>I. The Story of Artemision, cc. 1-25.</p>
<p>II. The Persian Army in Central Greece, cc. 26-39.</p>
<p>Each of these sub-sections invites further subdivision as

<p>Visit of the naval forces to Thermopylai, cc. 24-25.</p>
<p>A <foreign rend="ital">bon mot</foreign>: the prize of virtue, c. 26.</p>
<p>Such is a bare analysis of the whole passage on the naval
operations between Aphetai and Artemision, as presented by
Herodotus. Whether the items are recorded in true perspective
and chronological order, and whether the outline of events is
historically acceptable, are questions to be here postponed. But
one remark may be made affecting the merely literary presentation.
Obviously the story of the naval operations, although
resumed from Book 7 c. 196, where it has given place for a
time to the story of Thermopylai, yet here is treated as a substantive
and independent story, with something like a fresh
introduction: a literary device which certainly tends to obscure
the material relations between the operations at Thermopylai
and the operations off Artemision. The story is closed characteristically
with a <foreign rend="ital">bon mot,</foreign> which, however, is obviously intended
to apply as much to Leonidas and his men as to the naval
forces; the preceding chapters have just reunited the Persian
forces by the visit of the naval arm to Thermopylai to inspect
the evidences of the King's victory on land. Thus a distinct
pause in the story is marked by the anecdote in c. 26, and an
occasion gained for a distinct move forwards with the land forces
in the following passage. The pause is, moreover, augmented
by an <foreign rend="ital">excursus,</foreign> or digression, <foreign rend="ital">on the Feud between the Thessalians
and Phokians</foreign> (cc. 27-30), which, though connected with the
matter immediately in hand, the further advance of the Persians
in central Greece, yet harks back to events ‘some few years
before the King's expedition,’ and preserves fortunately some
details valuable in themselves, though quite unconnected with
the immediate subject.</p>

<p>The attack on Delphi: a miraculous preservation, cc. 34-39.</p>
<p>Herodotus here leaves the King and his army in Boiotia, in
order to resume the main argument, to wit the operations on sea,
which are to culminate at Salamis. The further movements of the
army are introduced in the subsequent narrative, at least until the
discomfiture of the King's fleet, as ancillary and subordinate to
the naval operations. It may be open to question where exactly
the next main section of the Book should be terminated most
conveniently, and most in accordance with the inner principles,
or instinct, governing the author's composition; but that something
of a new start is made with c. 40 is hardly to be denied.</p>

<p>The exact period, the number of days elapsing from the arrival
of the Greek Fleet at Salamis, c. 40, to the decision of the King
to do battle by sea, c. 69, is not marked or indicated by
Herodotus; and, as will be shown elsewhere, the passage just
analyzed cannot be regarded as giving a true perspective or
<pb n="xxxi"/>
chronology of the events, for example, of the Greek councils of
war. But the passage next in order must be taken as expressly
presenting the events of the day and night before the battle, with
the usual alternation from side to side, and the narrative then
passes at once into the description of the actual battle, such as it
is. The Analysis follows these diarial indications, as above for
Thermopylai and for Artemision.</p>

<p>Even this Analysis may fairly suggest that the account given
by Herodotus of the great battle dissolves into a mere spray or
broken succession of items and episodes, without much of argument
or unity, strategic or literary, underlying it. This character
of obscurity continues to rest upon the ensuing passage, in
particular the chronological indications, apparently so firm for
the day of battle and the preceding day, relapse into the vague.
<pb n="xxxii"/>
The Persian Fleet may have fled from Salamis on the evening, or
night, following the battle; but, in the text of Herodotus, this
movement is not recorded until (c. 107) after deliberations,
digressions and excursuses in the text, which seem to suggest an
appreciable lapse of time. At least all unity centred on Salamis
has disappeared with the notice of the oracle, which serves as a
<foreign rend="ital">colophon</foreign> to the account of the battle: and these observations
further justify the lines of the present Analysis.</p>

plainly a subordinate pause. Yet to some extent a new chronological
point rises in the next ensuing passage, together with a
complete change in the scene, and in the chief actors. The

<p>This passage supplies the last word on the Greek fleet, or on
the naval affairs, which have bulked so largely throughout this
Book, until the story is taken up again from this point in Book 9
c. 90. The remaining portion of this Book deals with acts and
negotiations in Greece, directly preliminary to the land-campaign
of Mardonios in the following year, or rather in the same year,
judging from the standpoint gained in 8. 132. Whether there
is a chronological relapse, or overlap, in consequence, between
the two sections cc. 126-132 on the one part, and cc. 133-144
on the other, is a fair question, but concerns rather the historical
criticism than the literary analysis of the passage. It is more
important in the present connexion to observe the complete
change of subject, scene, actors and interest in the passage next
ensuing, and its complete coherence with the first Part of the
ninth Book.</p>

<p>Reply of the Athenians to the Lakedaimonians, c. 144.</p>
<p>The foregoing analysis may be taken at least to demonstrate
the closeness and consequence in the structure, in the texture, so
to speak, of this Book, down to a certain point (c. 125). But that
the war involved a double set of operations, by land as well as
by sea, the chronological sequence of the narrative were unbroken,
except for the passage of the Historian from the Persian side to
the Greek and back again. The digressional and discursive
element is relatively insignificant in the eighth Book of
Herodotus. Apart from mere asides, or anecdotes <foreign rend="ital">en passant,</foreign>
there are but five separable excursuses in this Book, and two of
these are mere ‘notes,’ occupying small space. (1) The
Ethnography of the Peloponnesos, c. 73, is hardly called for in
the given context, but (2) the note on the Persian Postal Service,
c. 98, startles the reader only by its tardy appearance. (3) The
account of the causes of the Thessalian hostility to the Phokians,
cc. 27, 28, is fairly, if not fully justifiable, in its immediate
setting, while (4) the story of the Eunuch's Revenge, cc. 105,
106, though out of place, is a story after Herodotus' own heart.
Far the most considerable excursus is (5) that on the Makedonian
Royal House (c. 137), which, as foretold and promised in 5. 22,
has a special bearing on the problems of the composition and
construction of the work, as a whole.</p></div>
<div type="section" n="5">
<head>Characteristic and Analysis of Bk. 9</head>
<p>The ninth Book of Herodotus, as it stands, is the
shortest of the nine received divisions of the work, and calls
for but curt analysis. The narrative is all but continuous, so
far as the records of two concurrent and synchronous series of
events can be continuous. Apart from some trifling digressions
or excursuses, to be duly catalogued in their places, the Book falls
into two main divisions, the first (cc. 1-89) treating of the
conduct of the war on land, in Hellas proper, and culminating
in the victory of Plataia; the second (cc. 90-107, 114-122)
treating of the conduct of the war by sea, or rather by the
<pb n="xxxv"/>
maritime forces, and culminating in the victory of Mykale,
which was a victory in a land engagement, though apparently
won by the marines. Further analysis will present a better
conspectus of the substance and structure of each part.</p>

<p>As there are unusually precise data in the text regarding the
journal, or diary, of Plataia, from the occupation of ‘the second
position’ onwards, they have been utilized for the purposes of the
Analysis, but, of course, without prejudice to the questions of fact,
and the military problems underlying the presentation of the
whole matter in Herodotus. The purpose of this Analysis was
simply to represent the subject in bare outline, as found in the
Herodotean logography. How far his stories are consistent and
credible in themselves, in relation to each other, and to the
permanent or <foreign rend="ital">a priori</foreign> conditions of the problem (geographical,
strategic, anthropological), are questions not arising in a mere
Analysis. The Analysis, however, may be taken to show that
Herodotus describes the operations on the Asopos with unusual
minuteness at unusual length, and here if anywhere advances a
claim to be judged as a military historian. At least three distinct
positions are assigned to the Greek forces in the course of the
operations, and the account of the final engagement discriminates
clearly the behaviour of the two wings and the quondam centre.
Although in some few passages the author sets his readers on
the Persian side (cc. 24, 41-42, 58, 66, 89), the story is in the
main told obviously from the national standpoint, and in this case
even the Persian record is almost as much Greek as Barbarian.
Chronological sequence is manifestly abandoned in the miscellaneous
series of items and episodes comprised under the heading
‘After the Battle,’ though the items in themselves will be found
of special value for the determination of the sources and composition
of the first Part of the Book.</p>
<p>The digressional element is reduced almost to a minimum in
this Part. The record of the operations and events <foreign rend="ital">in loco</foreign> is
only interrupted by the stories of the Diviners, in cc. 33-37, and
<pb n="xxxviii"/>

the chronological sequence and continuity is dropped ‘after the

least one note, that on Dekeleia (c. 75), may carry down almost
as late as any other throughout the whole work.</p>

<p>Thus rapidly after the story of Plataia is once ended the work
of Herodotus draws to a close: were it not for the considerable
digressions, and especially the major one, which disparts
them, the stories of Mykale and of Sestos had been soon told,
and the symmetry in the composition, demanded to some extent
by the supposed co-ordination of the two series of events, were
even more hopelessly lost. The conscious parallelism in the
construction extends, perhaps, even so far as to establish a
balance between the two sieges, of Thebes (cc. 86-88) and of Sestos
(cc. 114-121); and the whole concludes most characteristically
with an anecdote, a <foreign rend="ital">bon mot,</foreign> which carries a moral for Greece,
<foreign rend="ital">mutato nomine,</foreign> and points in that manner the most obvious lesson
of the war just recorded, as a victory of the mountain over the
plain, of poverty over luxury, of the sound mind in sound body
over degenerate wearers of purple and fine linen. It is the moral
anticipated in the object-lesson of Pausanias, on Lakonic simplicity
and Persian pomp (c. 82), and by design, or happy accident,
might seem to have suggested the introduction of that lurid
picture of oriental despotism, vice and cruelty presented in the
major digression, on the amours of Xerxes, as though the historian
would say: Horrors of that kind were rendered for ever impossible
in Hellas by the stricken fields of Plataia and Mykale!</p>
<p>Thus compact, finished and complete, the work of Herodotus
as a whole, and the last three Books as its third volume, emerge
from our Analyses. And yet there are eminent authorities<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 The last, not the least, U. von
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who, in his
<title>Aristoteles und Athen,</title> i. 26 f. (1893),
asserts that “the present close of the
work of Herodotus is manifestly not in
accordance with the author's intention”
(<foreign rend="ital">dass der jetzige abschluss des herodoteischen
werkes nicht vom verfasser beabsichtigt
ist, liegt auf der hand oder sollte
es doch tun</foreign>). There is much virtue in
<foreign rend="ital">doch.</foreign></p></note> who
still doubt whether the ninth Book, whether the work as a whole,
is to be deemed finished and complete according to the design
and conception of the author; or whether, as clearly in the case
of Thucydides, some catastrophe prevented the fulfilment of the
historian's lifelong ambition. To the solution of this problem
our argument naturally proceeds.</p>

<pb n="xl"/></div>
<div type="section" n="6">
<head>Is the work of Herodotus incomplete, or unfinished?</head>
<p>Is the work of Herodotus, then, incomplete, unfinished,
as it stands? The comparative shortness of the ninth Book does
not make for an affirmative. Though the division into Books is
not the author's doing, the ninth Book possesses practically a
complete structure of its own, as above exhibited; the story of
Mykale and of Sestos is complete in itself, and the Colophon
with which the Book, and so the work, concludes is Herodotus'
own way of marking from time to time a pause, a <foreign rend="ital">finis,</foreign> more or
less absolute.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 For other examples of similar pauses,
or relative conclusions, marked by anecdotes,
cp. 3. 160; 4. 143-4; 6. 137-140;
7. 239 (well placed, even if not
genuine). The assertion that 9. 122 is
displaced in our text misses a point in
Herodotus' methods.</p></note> Nor are such peculiarities as may be detected
in the ninth Book attributable to want of finish, but mainly to
the nature of the subject and the Sources.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 The Sources of Bk. 9 are predominantly
Attic, cp. § 10 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> Appendices
VII., VIII., and Commentary <foreign rend="ital">passim</foreign>:
hence its Atticisms. But I base no
argument on its stylometry.</p></note> The final Book
of Thucydides may be taken to show unmistakeable signs of
incompleteness and want of finish: a chronological scheme
<foreign rend="ital">manqué,</foreign> speeches still all left in the oblique oration, stylistic
peculiarities, the abrupt breaking off. Not merely has the
annalistic record of Thucydides been arrested some years short
of its promised conclusion, but the latter end of it is obviously
in the raw, as compared with other portions. No such assertions
can be sustained against the final Book of Herodotus; at most
it might be said that Herodotus intended to carry on his story
further, that the main subject has not reached its proper end
with the capture of Sestos, and that another Book, or Books,
would be required to bring down the history of the war to its
actual finale. But what should this proper finale have been?
Ought Herodotus to have carried his story down to the transfer
of the naval hegemony, or to the victory of the Eurymedon, or
to the Peace of Kallias, if there was such a Peace, or to the <foreign rend="ital">de
facto</foreign> cesser of hostilities between Persia and Athens, wherever
that is to be placed? Not one of these events, real or supposed,
would be a better finish to the story than the point at which
Herodotus leaves off, before the schism between Sparta and
Athens, before the new departure involved in carrying the war
into the enemy's country, before the disappearance and disgrace
of the heroes of the war, before the entrance on the scene of new


<pb n="xli"/>
actors and the rise of new interests. Herodotus is an artist, not
a mere annalist; but, even from the strictest historical point of
view, the story of ‘the great expedition’ may be considered ended
after the battles of Plataia and Mykale, with the triumphant
return of the Athenian fleet from Sestos, bringing home the
cables which had yoked the Hellespont, linked Asia and Europe,
and rendered the vast invasion possible. No ancient authority,
or critic, regarded the work of Herodotus as incomplete, or
suspected an intention on his part to carry his narrative below
the point just indicated. On the contrary, the Persian war,
the great expedition, meant for his successors, from Thucydides
to Diodoros, exactly what it had meant for Herodotus himself.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Thucydides virtually begins his
review of the <title>Pentekontaëteris</title> from the
point reached by Hdt., the overlaps
being only such as to dovetail his
narrative into that of his predecessor;
cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.89">Thuc. 1. 89</bibl> ff. For Diodoros cp.
Appendix I. § 13 (vol. ii. p. 74).</p></note>
To suppose that these authorities, imprimis Thucydides, accepted
an imperfect conception of the subject due to the accidental
failure of Herodotus to carry out his whole project, is to ascribe
to them an exaggerated respect for his authority. Probably the
conception of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ *mhdika/</foreign> as the Invasion of Xerxes, comprising
the two campaigns of 480 and 479 B.C., came to Herodotus
himself ready-made, an accepted view of the case, justifiable on
its merits: he simply stereotyped and gave it currency. Nowhere
does he indicate precisely in advance the limits of his
subject, or the date, or event, which is the terminus of the war;
there is no ground so convincing as that would be, had he
announced an end which he fails to reach, for charging the work
with incompleteness. The only plausible argument in support
of the view that the work of Herodotus is incomplete as it
stands arises from the unfulfilled promises made by the author
in the course of the work. There are three such cases in all:
two of these, the promise to relate the capture of Nineveh
(1. 106), and the promise to make mention of some kings of
Babylon (1. 184), do not affect the conclusion of the work as
it stands; for no one can suppose that the fulfilment of these
pledges was to find place in the present work after the record
of the capture of Sestos. Either Herodotus at some time
contemplated a distinct work on Assyrian history, or he intended
to add to the end of the third Book, as we have it, some further

<pb n="xlii"/>
notices of Babylon and Assyria. It is difficult to set down the
non-fulfilment of these two promises, <foreign rend="ital">in pari materia,</foreign> and occurring
so nearly together, to an oversight, and I am inclined to
believe that Herodotus had projected a separate work on
‘Assyrian’ history, which he never achieved. The argument is
different in the third and only remaining case, the promise to
complete the story of Epialtes, 7. 213, which is nowhere
fulfilled. But, if we are not here in presence of a pure oversight,
at most the case proves that Herodotus did not quite fully
and finally revise his work; it cannot prove that he had projected
a later close, or finale. Such a project would have landed him
in the <title>Pentekontaëteris</title> to encounter all the difficulties and inconsequence
above adverted to, in seeking a better, a more
artistic conclusion than his actual work presents. Moreover,
the numerous explicit references to events of the <title>Pentekontaëteris,</title>
which occur throughout the work of Herodotus, and especially
in the last three Books, supply a positive bar to the supposition
that he intended to carry his connected and continuous narrative
over any considerable portion of the period subsequent to the
capture of Sestos. On any such hypothesis those references
would involve reiterated anticipations of the narrative still to
come of an inartistic and clumsy sort, which has no parallel in
the actual work of Herodotus.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 On the references to the events of the <title>Pentekontaeteris</title> see § 8 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></note> Yet, if we are led to acquiesce
in the view that the work of Herodotus missed the very last
revision from the author's hand, it is less on the strength of this
one clearly unfulfilled pledge than on account of the occurrence
of numerous inconsequences, or maladroitnesses, which repeated
filing might perhaps have removed from the finished work,
much as your modern author will revise a complete and final
edition of his works: though even in such a case a writer rarely
succeeds in removing all inequalities, or inconsequences, from
productions drawn from various quarters, dealing with many
diverse interests and topics, and spread in composition over a
considerable number of years; and it may be doubted whether
any number of revisions and retractations could quite have
brought every story, every chapter, every line in the work of
Herodotus into perfect consistency with every other, in view of
his empirical methods and conflicting sources.</p>

<pb n="xliii"/>
<p>A further argument in favour of the view that the work of
Herodotus is complete, after the author's own conception, is to
be found in the general plan and scope of the work as a whole.
The whole falls, as has been already, and elsewhere more fully
shown, into three great sections, or volumes, each comprising, as
it happens, a trio of Books, and each nearly equivalent in bulk
to each. A remarkable symmetry and proportion obtain in the
tripartite work, anticipating, perhaps suggesting, the symmetry
in the work of Thucydides, had the latter but obtained the
destined bulk and finish from its author's hand. In neither
case was the actual plan of the complete and symmetric work
in existence before the inception of the undertaking: in each
case, surely, the idea of the whole dawned and grew upon the
author in the course of composition. This hypothesis is verifiable
in the case of Thucydides, and highly probable in the case of
Herodotus. But in the latter case, whatever may have been
the point or stage at which the author first conceived the
idea of the work as a whole, matters nothing to the present
argument for the completeness of the work as it stands. To
have added, that is inserted, the <title>Assyrian Logoi,</title> which were
surely to have been as bulky as the <title>Egyptian,</title> or at least as the
<title>Libyan Logoi,</title> would have destroyed the symmetry of the extant
whole, <foreign rend="ital">a parte ante</foreign>; to have carried the chronicle of the wars
with Persia down to the battle of the Eurymedon, or the more
complete end of actual hostilities, about the time of Perikles'
ascendency, would have destroyed the symmetry of the work <foreign rend="ital">a
parte post.</foreign> The addition, indeed, of the further records, or <title>Logoi,</title>
indicated to the first and the third sections, or volumes, of the
work respectively, would have left the symmetry of the composition
inviolate, but would enormously have increased the bulk
of the whole, would have still further retarded the main
argument by a fresh digression, and would have destroyed the
moral atmosphere and effect of the work, by involving the story
in the decadence and disruption of Hellas. It may have been
the very impossibility of adding to the story of the Persian war,
of carrying it below the capture of Sestos, without departing
from recognized principles, and becoming entangled in endless
difficulties and inconsequences, which determined Herodotus to
preserve the proportions of his work as a whole by omitting
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)assu/rioi lo/goi</foreign> from the first volume, and reserving the
<pb n="xliv"/>
fuller stories of Nineveh and of the Babylonian kings for an
entirely distinct work. If the <title>Assyrian Logoi</title> were to have been
a separate and distinct work, as appears most probable, then the
references and promises in respect of them in no degree bear
out the view that the existing work was incomplete, or unfinished,
in the author's judgement and conception. The
argument has to rely simply upon the promise in the seventh
Book, a frail support for a conclusion otherwise so improbable;
and as it can be shown, from numerous authentic additions and
insertions, that the author revised his work certainly once,
and probably more than once, the most extreme conclusion
justified by the state of the evidences amounts to no more than
the admission that Herodotus, had he revised his work yet once
again, might have removed a few more of the still remaining
inconcinnities, which go to prove that the work, as we have it,
artistic, complete, and highly finished as it is, a whole, with a
beginning, a middle and an end, nevertheless was not originally
conceived and projected upon the lines, and with the structure
and great argument thereinto imported by the author in the
course of his years of apprenticeship and mastery.</p>
<p>Last, and not least, if not merely is the work a result of years
of study, of wandering, of experience and production, as all critics
will in some degree admit: if also the earliest portion, or section,
of the work to attain relative completeness and definite form was
just the History of the Great Invasion, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ *mhdika/</foreign>, our last three
Books: why, then, the argument in favour of regarding the work
as complete and finished, in structure and general conception,
gains additional weight and substance. If the history of the
Medic war was the primary and principal subject to the record
and illustration of which Herodotus first addressed himself, it is
probable that the history of the Medic war is complete and
finished in the author's conception and creation. This history
forming the end of the Herodotean work, as we have it, that
work is finished, and has reached its proper end, whatever <foreign rend="ital">lacunae</foreign>
may be detected in its earlier portions. The problem of the
order in which the various parts and portions of the work of
Herodotus were composed, or the materials for their composition
collected, is in itself an important and interesting problem to the
student of historical literature. Should it be decided in accordance
with the hypothesis just indicated, it must be held to afford
<pb n="xlv"/>
fresh ground for recognizing the work as finished and complete
in its present form; and all arguments for the substantive priority
of Books 7, 8, 9 become ancillary arguments for the completion
and completeness of the work. Should the problem of the order
of composition be decided otherwise, or be held definitely insoluble,
still all the considerations already adduced remain to
make it practically quite certain that the connected and continuous
story of the Barbarian and Hellenic worlds, and of the
wars waged between them, had reached its end and conclusion,
as conceived and projected for his work by the author; and
nothing in the work itself, much less elsewhere, justifies the view
that the story of the war is incomplete.</p></div>
<div type="section" n="7">
<head>General considerations in support of the priority of Bks. 7, 8, 9</head>
<p>The view that the contents of the last three Books were
the earliest portion of the work collected, and even put by the
author into literary shape, has been repeatedly advanced by
competent critics,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Blakesley in England (1854) and
A. Scholl in Germany (1855) were apparently
the first to suggest it; A.
Bauer's <title>Entstehung des Herodotischen
Geschichtswerkes.</title> Wien. 1878, is still the
most considerable tract in its support;
cp. my <title>Herodotus IV.-VI.,</title> vol. i. p.
xcii (1895).</p></note> but cannot be said to be much in favour at
the present time. The case, indeed, has never been quite fully
stated, nor the whole argument sufficiently elaborated. Undue
stress has been laid on one or two partial observations, and
certain cumulative arguments have been overlooked, or treated
as self-evident. An absolutely demonstrable conclusion is not
likely to be attained upon this subject, the problem being mainly
a literary one, where direct testimony is not forthcoming. But
at least the question should be recognized as a purely open one
at starting, unprejudiced by the particular order in which the
subject matter is now presented in the finished and completed
work. The primitive assumption that the <title>Logoi</title> of Herodotus
were collected and written down by him in just the order in
which they now meet us in his work, though substantially maintained
by Kirchhoff,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 <title>Ueber die Entstehungszeit des Herodotischen
Geschichtswerkes,</title> 2te Aufl.,
Berlin, 1878, maintains the composition
of the work strictly in the existing
order, but recognizes three stages and
three localities in its genesis, Bks. 1, 2,
3. 1-119 having been composed before
Hdt.'s migration to Thurioi. Bks. 3.
120-160, 4 and 5. 1-76 at Thurioi between
443 and 432 B.C., and Bks. 5. 77-124,
6, 7, 8, 9 at Athens during the
early years of the ‘Peloponnesian war.’
Cp. § 9 p. lvi <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> According to the
more naive doctrine of the ancients the
work of Hdt. was all accomplished at
one time in one place, whether early
at Samos (Suidas) or later at Thurioi
(Pliny, <title>Nat. Hist.</title> 12. 18).</p></note> is neither probable in itself nor in accordance


<pb n="xlvi"/>
with analogy, nor borne out by the inner indications to be found
in the work itself. The clearest single test of such an assumption
is the position of the second Book; for the occurrence of this
colossal excursus, so early in the course of the work, is difficult
to reconcile with the hypothesis that the existing work was
conceived as a whole, and its several parts composed exactly in
the existing order. The date of the author's visit to Egypt, the
date of the composition of the second Book, which is a unity in
itself, must be treated, at starting, as open questions; so must
the date and origin of each subordinate unit, into which the work
of Herodotus can be fairly analyzed, be left at starting an open
question: the Skythian, the Libyan, the Lydian, the Medo-Persian
histories, the records and traditions of particular Hellenic states
(Samos, Athens, Sparta, Korinth, Syracuse), the Ionian Revolt,
the Marathonian campaign, and likewise the account of the Great
Invasion, must all be regarded as potentially separable units. The
problems of genesis, date and composition arise equally in relation
to the many precise passages of a digressional or excursional
character with which the work is enriched; such materials have
been gathered, perhaps, at widely different epochs of the author's
life, and may have been inserted in the work at various dates;
the order of their occurrence in the work by no means corresponds
of necessity to the chronological order of their collection,
or of their insertion. One conclusion, perhaps only one, need
be posited at starting, that the whole work of Herodotus being
composed of many different and separable units, partly corresponding
to, but partly irrespective of, the existing division into
nine Books, these parts, or subdivisions, still recognizable in the
work will have existed, some or all, in a state of relative completion,
or substantial independence, before they were brought
together and fused, more or less flawlessly, into the existing
whole. The exact degree of that independence and individuality
may have varied in different cases, great and small, and can
never have amounted, except perhaps in the case of the second
Book, and of some minor and clearly detachable excursuses,
digressions, stories, to complete identity of form and substance
with the passages as now observable in the work of Herodotus.
<pb n="xlvii"/>
Any other assumption would involve the corollary that
Herodotus, notwithstanding the splendid artistic result, put his
materials together by a purely mechanical method, and that the
final redaction, perhaps the last of several revisions, was without
appreciable effect upon the composition, the fusion, the organisation
of the whole. Such a corollary were an absurdity. But
there is no inherent absurdity in the view that the artistic whole
is a product, not of one original and single inspiration, proceeding
from one single idea, but of a gradual enlargement of plan, and
probably of materials and knowledge; there is no absurdity in
the assumption that even the skilful and artistic hand of
Herodotus, applied again and again to his great and growing
work, failed to remove and obliterate entirely all traces of its
genesis. The genesis of the work is a legitimate subject of
speculation, and what theory is at once more simple and more
consistent with the work, as we find it, than the view that
Herodotus first projected and, to a greater or less extent, first
elaborated the History of the Persian War, in Bks. 7, 8, 9,
though not in quite the exact form, or with all the details, now
presented in those Books; and that afterwards there developed
before his mind the possibility of working up into a vast prelude
to that main theme materials amassed during many years of
study, research, inquiry, travel, a prelude that should pourtray
the historic antecedents, both Barbarian and Hellenic, of the
great struggle, and present in vivid colours a panorama of the
two worlds that clashed together in the final duel?</p>
<p>There would certainly have been much more of novelty in
an attempt to relate, in an adequate and also picturesque manner,
the story of a recent war, as represented in the last three Books
of Herodotus, than in the attempt to reproduce geographical
descriptions and ethnographical memoranda more or less in the
style of Hekataios, such as are to be found in the second and
fourth Books, and to a considerable extent also in the first, third,
and fifth. The precise advance which Herodotus made upon his
prose predecessors appears to have lain in his applying to history
methods and ideas drawn from the only sphere of literary art so
far practised, poetry, and chiefly the <title>Epos</title> and the <title>Drama.</title> To
emulate Phrynichos and Aischylos by taking a subject from the
immediate past, and to relate it in prose, with artifices and
methods largely drawn from the Homeric <title>Epos</title> as well as from
<pb n="xlviii"/>
the stage, was an inspiration far surpassing any previous achievement
in prose composition, and one well worthy the genius of
Herodotus. While the subject was thus original, the methods of
representation were largely imitative. There is no part of the
work of Herodotus where the Homeric influence is so visible as
in the last three Books. The introduction is modelled upon the
first Book of the <title>Iliad</title>; the second Book of the <title>Iliad</title> supplies a
good precedent for the catalogue of Army and Navy. Elsewhere
Herodotus might seem to have drawn his inspiration from the
<title>Odyssey,</title> as he travels, or seems to travel, over the world, visiting
the tribes and cities of men in many climes; the concentration of
interest on the war in the last three Books reproduces rather the
atmosphere of the older <foreign rend="ital">epos.</foreign> It is unnecessary to pursue these
analogies into detail: the direct deposit of Homeric style and
terminology is strongest in the last three Books.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. Appendix II. § 2, vol. ii. p. 125,
and Commentary <foreign rend="ital">ad ll.</foreign></p></note> A similar
observation holds of the relation of these Books to the Drama.
The influence of Aischylos is undeniable, less in details concerning
the march or the battle, where there are also noticeable
differences between Herodotus and the poet, than in the presentation
of character, and in the moral setting of the whole. It has
been observed also that the speeches in the last three Books of
Herodotus are far more truly dramatic than the speeches in the
earlier Books.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 The most authentic-looking speeches
are in <foreign rend="ital">oratio obliqua,</foreign> e.g. 8. 83. Cp.
§ 11 (&lt;*&gt;)  <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></note> There they are too often mere substitutes for
narrative; here they have a real bearing on action, and the
march of events. It was not, we may fairly surmise, at the end
of his life and literary achievement that Herodotus would show
most clearly such influences. The distinctly religious tone of the
narrative favours the same conclusion. The heroic and poetical
standpoint of Herodotus breaks down in the later decades of the
century into the colder estimates of Thucydides.<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 Cp. Appendix I. § 4.</p></note> Herodotus
writes this history in the spirit of Aischylos and of Simonides, of
Panyasis and of Pindar. The little we know of his biography,
and particularly of his early education, favours the view that the
subject he first chose for literary illustration in prose was an
epical subject, such as that offered by the invasion of Xerxes.
Herodotus was trained, so to speak, in the school of his uncle
Panyasis, one of the last of the epic poets. His history of the



<pb n="xlix"/>
great invasion is but the application of the principles of Panyasis
to a new subject, the freshest that could have engaged his
attention, or lent itself to such treatment.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. Suidas, <foreign rend="ital">s.v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*hanu/asis</foreign>. On the relation of Choirilos and Hdt. cp. § 10 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></note> Materials and
encouragement would not be wanting in Halikarnassos, where
Artemisia had but just passed away; in Samos, which had played
no unimportant part at the crucial moment; in Ionia, which had
supplied no small part of the King's Fleet, and had revolted, ‘for
the second time,’ as Ionians were proud to remember, from the
Persian yoke on the morrow of Mykale. When Herodotus began
to write, about the middle of the fifth century, some thirty
years after the victory of Salamis, and before the travels, more or
less extensive, in Europe, in Libya, in Asia, which are implied in
the earlier Books, what boon could he bring to European audiences
more acceptable than the deft and glorious records of the Greek
victory over the hosts of Asia—meet pendant to the Trojan war
—or what stronger motive could he have for visiting European
Hellas than the desire to complete, by the means there available
to him, in Athens, in Delphi, in Sparta, the projected story, and
round it into a finished whole?</p>
<p>Whatever be the varying proportion of written to oral sources
in the successive parts of the work of Herodotus, for no part of
his record can Herodotus have had oral tradition so copious and
so fresh as for the history of the Invasion contained in the last
three Books. The amount of matter in these Books drawn from
literary sources has, indeed, been generally under-estimated; but
be it set never so high, there remains a larger and more constant
echo of the <foreign rend="ital">vox viva</foreign> in this volume than in any other equal
portion of the work. It could hardly be otherwise from the
nature of the case, and from the relation of the author to his
subject. Herodotus stands indeed to his subject in one degree
less intimate than Thucydides to the annals of the Peloponnesian
war, but he was only just not contemporary with the expedition
of Xerxes. The elder generation, amongst whom he grew up, had
taken part in the war, upon the Persian side; nor was it only
with one medizing Greek from Greece proper that he had held
converse.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. 9. 16 and § 10 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></note> The happy selection of a virgin subject, knowledge of

and women, themselves witnesses and actors in the drama, goes
far to explain the most characteristic quality of the author's style,
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)rome/nh le/cis</foreign>, that impression of the living voice in the
literary narrative, caught naturally in the first instance from the
lips of the story-teller, mother, or mother's brother, exile and
refugee, Ionian, Dorian, Persian, and what not. It is, indeed,
not easy to detect more than one style in Herodotus, the
acquisition or formation of which is most readily explained by the
supposition that it was first acquired and exercised on such a
subject, and on such materials, as those presented in the last
three Books, and then applied, with but slight modification, to
more remote subjects, for which literary evidences were already
forthcoming in greater abundance, as was the case, in varying
degrees, with the earlier Books of the finished work.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 I have despaired of applying stylometric

<head>Particular passages favourable to the priority of Bks. 7, 8, 9</head>
<p>All these general observations and reflexions could at
best establish but a probability in favour of the prior composition
of the story of the Great Invasion. That probability requires to
be fortified and supplemented by a detailed examination of the
passages, of various kinds and orders, which may be quoted in
support of the main thesis. These passages are, of course,
cumulative in their evidential value, and their partial classification
will (it is to be hoped) strengthen, or clarify, the argument.
Two or three obvious considerations, however, tend to complicate
the problem, or at least to generate <foreign rend="ital">caveats</foreign> or canons in bar of
too facile a conclusion. (i.) Herodotus undoubtedly draws,
throughout his work, from a great variety of sources, without a
strenuous attempt to co-ordinate their data, or reduce the result
to self-consistency. Inconsistencies, inconsequences, may be
found not merely between Book and Book, but often in close
juxtaposition in his pages. In either case such occurrences may
prove not differences of time and design in composition, but
simply differences of source imperfectly reduced. Again, (ii.) the
indubitable fact of revision, of insertions on revision, while it
helps to explain, helps also to obscure the evidence in regard to
the genesis of the work; and in some cases we are left with an

<pb n="li"/>
apparently arbitrary or capricious result, and no good reason
why a given passage, note, or remark occurs in this rather than
in that context. If in the end there emerge not a demonstrated
conclusion, but at best a tenable hypothesis, there will still be a
twofold gain—incidentally a harvest of problematic and interesting
gobbets gleaned from the work, the co-ordination of which is, in
itself, an essay in the higher criticism; and ultimately a resultant
theory, which more than any of the known alternatives renders
the genesis of the work, as a whole, intelligible, and explains how
parts, at first sight so disparate, as, for example, the first three and
the last three Books of Herodotus, come to fall into their places
as symmetrical factors in the organic opus. Finally, (iii.) the
problem is a literary, or at most a biographical one; success and
failure in its solution alike leave the historical values in the work
intact. The truth or falsity, the weight or authority, of what
Herodotus reports of the Persian war is but little affected by the
determination of the precise date, within the possible range of
twenty years, at which he reduced it to writing: least of all
could the priority of the last three Books militate against their
authority. Subject to these cautions the argument may proceed
with its review of the proofs in detail.</p>
<p>The story of the war ends appropriately with the capture of
Sestos; but in no equal part of the work of Herodotus are there
so many references to later history as in the last three Books.
To events, situations, developments, falling into the period conveniently
and correctly known as the <title>Pentekontaeteris,</title><note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 <foreign xml:lang="greek">penthkontaethri/s</foreign> is the term used

sources, in the three volumes respectively,
will in part account for this
difference in the distribution of contemporary
references, but not wholly.</p></note> From
the chronological rearrangement of these references an important
observation results. Three cases carry down to the opening
years of the third Peloponnesian war, the Ten Years' War of Thucydides<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 These three cases may be numbered:
(35) the reference to the Theban surprise
of Plataia, in 431 B.C., 7. 233, cp.

note to 7. 235. 6 (i. 346).</p></note>;
the other thirty and odd cases, with one doubtful instance,



<pb n="lii"/>
carry down only to the breach between Athens and Sparta, and
the first Peloponnesian war.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 The exact succession can scarcely
be determined for all cases, but the
dates, or approximate dates, for the
more important events can be ascertained,
and this evidence is irrespective
of the general atmosphere, and signs of
afterthought, perceptible throughout the
narrative. To the first decade or so
after the war might be reckoned the
rewards, or punishments, meted out to
actors in the war, whether on the Persian
or the Greek side, with other more or
less cognate matters: (1) Theomuestor
and Phylakos, 8. 85; (2) Xeinagoras, 9.
107; (3) Megapanos, 7. 62; (4) Amyntas(?),
8. 136; (5) rewards for the burial
of Mardonios, 9. 84; (6) fate of Masistes,
9. 108-113; (7) rewards to Maskames
and his descendants, 7. 106 (carries down
into the reign of Artaxerxes); and here
might be added (8) ‘the old age of
Amastris,’ 7. 114. On the Greek side:
the cases of (9) Antidoros, 8. 11; (10)
Sikinnos, 8. 75; (11) Epialtes, 7. 213;
(12) Hegesistratos, 9. 38; (13) the
Tenians, 8. 82; (14) the Korkyraians,
7. 168, a case that might carry down
much later. There are, besides, the
notices of monuments and relies connected
with the war, which imply dates
in the <title>Pentekontaëteris</title> for their erection,
or it may be for the historian's view of
them, such as (15) the tombs at Thermopylai,
7. 228; (16) offerings at Delphi,
8. 121, 122, cp. 7. 179, 9. 81; (17) at
Athens, 7. 189; (18) at Plataia, 9. 83.
But of more interest are the events in
Greek history to be dated previous to
the first rupture between Sparta and
Athens, such as (19) the liberation of
Thrace, 7. 106; (20) the heroism of
Boges, 7. 107; (21) the transfer of the
naval hegemony, 8. 3; (22) the battle
of Tegea, 9. 34; (23) the battle of
Dipaia, <foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>; (24) the Tarantine disaster,
7. 170; (25) the death of Hermolykos,
472 B.C., 9. 105; (26) the exploit
of Aneristos, 468 B.C.? 7. 137; (27) the
expulsion of Mikythos, 467 B.C.? 7. 170;
(28) the medism of Themistokles, 466
B.C., 8. 109; (29) deaths of Sophanes
and Leagros, 465 B.C., 9. 75; (30) the
Messeman war, 464 B.C., 9. 34; (31)
death of Aeimnestos, 464 B.C., 9. 64.
Events after the rupture between Athens
and Sparta (462 B.C.) follow: (32) the
war in Egypt, 459 B.C., 7. 7; (33) the
battle of Tanagra, 457 B.C., 9. 34; (34)
the embassy of Kallias, 7. 151, possibly
earlier than the war in Egypt, but more
probably after the death of Kimon (449
B.C.), or even after the Thirty Years'
Truce (445 B.C.). In the latter case there
is a considerable gap between the dates
of (33) and (34).</p></note> The latest event in this the main
body, or stream, of references to contemporary events is the
mention of the battle of Tanagra (457 B.C.).<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 9. 34. See No. (33) in preceding
note.</p></note> In the references,
then, to events subsequent to the ostensible close of the historian's
record, there are two groups: the first group comprises a considerable
mass of references belonging chronologically to the
twenty years immediately succeeding the fall of Sestos; the
second consists of three references, which belong chronologically


<pb n="liii"/>
to the years 431-430 B.C., and may of course have been actually
penned a year or two later. Between the two groups of references
there is objectively a chronological interval of nearly thirty years,
perhaps broken by a single reference, of doubtful date.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
conclusion to which these observations point is clear. The last
three Books of Herodotus must in the main have been composed
not very long after the battle of Tanagra, in part presumably
from information collected upon the European side; but this
draft was laid aside for many years, and then revised, or retouched,
in the opening years of the Peloponnesian war, the Ten Years'
War, apparently during a visit to Athens. If there was a second
or intervening revision in the meanwhile, it involved no reference
to contemporary events in Hellas (with the one doubtful exception
above mentioned), and was, therefore, presumably made in some
place where Herodotus was removed from the main current of
Hellenic affairs. It is manifest that these observations accord
perfectly with the hypothesis that the last three Books of
Herodotus were in substance composed some time before the
previous six Books, that their first draft was succeeded by a period
of travel, or further travel, and research; and that the work of
Herodotus, as we have it, only came into existence after the
author's return to Athens, and is the result of a third and final
revision from the author's own hand, in the opening years of the
Peloponnesian war: a revision, perhaps, never quite fully carried
out.</p>
<p>In view of the number of passages in the last three Books
where matters are mentioned which have been more fully
described or narrated in the previous Books, it is curious (if we
are to believe that the first six Books were already in existence
before the last three Books were written) that there are only
two express references in the last three Books to passages in
the earlier Books. Of these two references the first is on a
very trivial point, is made in somewhat unusual form, without
any personal reference, and reads very like a gloss.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 93 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=toi de\</foreign> (sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ka=res</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(/tines

case is irreproachable in form, is quite in Herodotus' usual
manner, is made to an important passage, or rather to two im<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 No. (34) in note 1, previous page.
This passage might belong to the final

referring moreover to events which have been previously implied
in the narrative and speeches of the seventh Book, it is more
probably a later addition, on revision, from the author's own
hand, than an integral part of the first or original draft of the
history of the Great Invasion. Certainly neither of these
passages should be cited in support of the view that the Books of
Herodotus were composed in just the order in which they now
stand, or even that the seventh Book is later in original conception,
or composition, than the first, the fifth and the sixth.
There is also something apparently capricious in this one express
reference to an earlier story, in view of the many passages where
reference to the earlier Books, had those earlier Books been in
existence, would have been equally in point, or even more so.
The argument <foreign rend="ital">a silentio</foreign> may not be much stronger in this
than in any other application, yet it counts for something, and
must be faced. Whatever, indeed, may be the best explanation
of the anomalies presented by the following cases, the anomalies
demand attention.</p>
<p>The total absence of any reference back from the Army and
Navy Lists in Book 7 to passages on the same tribes and nations
as described in the first four Books is remarkable, if the first four
Books were compiled and composed before the seventh; the
silence is simple enough, on the supposition that the seventh
Book is older in the genesis of Herodotus' work than the earlier
Books. Persians, Medes, Skyths, Libyans, Arabians, Aithiopians,
Egyptians, Assyrians defile before us in the seventh Book as
though we had never heard of them before; but the passages in
the seventh Book concerning them show in some respects a more
imperfect and presumably earlier state of knowledge. The
absence of express reference to the story of the conquest of
Egypt as told in the third Book is remarkable; still more
remarkable is the absence of any express reference to the story
of the Skythian expedition of Dareios, if the third and fourth
Books were already in existence when Herodotus was writing
the seventh. Could he have lost himself in wonder over the

<pb n="lv"/>
bridges and canal of Xerxes if he had already described, without
astonishment, the bridges and canal of Dareios, the latter at least
a far more stupendous work? The total omission of any
reference to Kyrene in relation to the expedition of Xerxes is
the more remarkable, if Herodotus was already so fully acquainted
with the history of Kyrene as he shows himself in the Libyan
<title>Logoi.</title> All these, and other similar if less striking omissions of
direct reference, are easily intelligible on the supposition that
Herodotus drafted the history of the expedition of Xerxes in
much the form now presented by the seventh and following
Books before he had written, or even acquired the materials for
writing, the earlier Books, more especially those portions of the
earlier Books which describe the history and antiquities of the
non-Hellenic nations, whether civilised or barbarous.</p>
<p>There are three or four passages in the last three Books
which clash with passages in the earlier Books, and where the
absence of a reference, or explanation, is almost inexplicable on
the supposition that the last three Books were the last compiled,
or composed, by the author. (1) To take the two notices of
Sophanes of Dekeleia, and especially his victory in a duel with
Eurybates the Argive, in Aigina: the absence in 9.75 of any
reference to 6.92, if the latter passage was in existence when
the former passage was first penned, is certainly remarkable. (2)
In this connexion it might further be urged that the absence in
Book 7 of any reference to the story, or details, of the Aiginetan
war, had that story already been committed to writing in the
form now found in Books 5 and 6, is also a noticeable omission.
The confusion and obscurity in which that story is involved in
no wise militate against the later date for the fifth and sixth
Books. (3) Still more striking is a third instance, where a
backward reference might fairly be expected, all the more because
there is inconsistency, not to say contradiction, involved in the
two passages. Book 7. 163 gives a story of Kadmos, son of Skythes
of Kos, and of his father Skythes, in which the absence of any
reference to Book 6. 23, 24, where a variant story of Skythes is
told, is the more astonishing in view of the difficulty of reconciling,
or harmonising, the data of the two passages. This omission
is more intelligible on the supposition that the passage in the
sixth Book is the younger passage, and was not in existence
when Herodotus first penned the passage in the seventh Book,
<pb n="lvi"/>
than on the reverse hypothesis. (4) There is another pair of
passages, in this case, indeed, a precise doublet, which would
settle once for all the priority of the eighth Book to the first, in
order of composition, could the authenticity of the two passages
be guaranteed. Book 8. 104 appears to reproduce from Book
1. 175 an account of the portent of the bearded priestess of
Pedasa, in almost identical terms, but with one marked variation:
according to Bk. 8 the portent has occurred twice, according to
Bk. 1 three times. The conclusion is obvious: the passage in
Book 1 is the later of the two. Unfortunately for the argument
the occurrence of this unique doublet suggests a scribe's gloss,
in one place or the other; and the variation may easily pass for
a lapse of memory, or of pen, on the glossator's part.</p>
<p>On mere inconsistencies, or even apparent contradictions,
between passages in the last three Books and in the first six, cited
to prove the independence of the last three Books as against the
first six, and the probability therefore of their prior composition,
much stress cannot be laid; for the cases cited need prove only the
independence of the sources in various parts of Herodotus' work,
and the absence of a thorough co-ordination and rationalisation
of the data of varying sources—facts everywhere patent throughout
the work of Herodotus. If, for example, in the seventh Book
(c. 8) Aristagoras accompanies the Greeks to Sardes in 498 B.C.,
while in the history of the Ionian revolt (5. 99) he stays behind
in Miletos, it may be said that the latter statement is obviously
preferable, and shows better knowledge, and is consequently a
later statement; it may also, however, be said that the former
is a blunder dramatically put into the mouth of Xerxes, and in
no way commits Herodotus. It would be fair to reply that the
blunder seems a rather gratuitous one; but still, the inconsistency
here has obviously a very low evidential value either way.
Again, in Book 7. 54 Xerxes the Persian king pours libations,
while in Book 1. 132 we learn that the Persians have no such
custom or rite. Had Herodotus possessed this information when
he wrote that passage, he must (it is said) have suppressed, or at
least have explained, the inconsequence. But the argument is
not convincing. Herodotus might follow an ill-informed tradition,
and forget in one place what he had said in another, especially
in passages of such different character and provenience; or again,
Xerxes might sanction religious rites, upon occasion, which were
<pb n="lvii"/>
not strictly ‘Persian,’ and so on. A supposed inconsistency has
been discovered between the statement in 9. 35 that Teisamenos
and his brother were the only outlanders ever admitted to the
Spartan franchise, and the record in 4. 145 of the admission of
the Minyai; but again reply is easy. The one case belongs to
the historical, the other to the legendary period; Herodotus
overlooks the infinitesimal inconsequence; or, finally, he records
that the Minyai lost the franchise after gaining it, so the instance
would hardly count. A fairer case might be made out in the
fuller details of the domestic history of some of the recent Spartan
kings given in Bk. 6, as compared with Bk. 7; but even here
difference of source might account for most of the variations, and
in any case our author's whole style and method of research,
thought, and composition is hardly close and cogent enough
to give such observations any great weight in determining the
theory of the order in which various parts or sections of his
history were composed.</p>
<p>Much more weight attaches to a group, or series, of passages
found in Books 7, 8, 9, the presence of which therein would be
more or less anomalous, or surprising, if Books 1-6 had been
written first. Thus, it is curious that we should have to wait until
the seventh Book (c. 11) for the Achaimenid Pedigree, if Books
1-3 were composed before Books 7-9. The natural and proper
place for its introduction would have been in connexion with the
accession of Dareios, or failing that, as Herodotus calls Kyros an
Achaimenid,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 3. 75 <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rca/menos de\ a)p' *)axaime/neos e)genehlo/ghse th\n patrih\n th\n *ku/rou</foreign>—as
Hdt. has made Xerxes do in 7. 11.</p></note> in connexion with his name. The device of placing
his own pedigree in the lips of Xerxes suggests that Herodotus
was rather hard bestead for an excuse to introduce a matter
which might much more easily have been introduced in the first
or in the third Books, had he written, or had he entertained the
plan of writing, them at the time. A similar remark attaches
to other pedigrees which occur in the last three Books. It is
curious that we should have to wait until these Books are
unrolled for the genealogies of the Spartan kings, and of
Alexander of Makedon. It may be said that the pedigree of
Leonidas (7. 204), the pedigree of Leotychidas (8. 131), are
introduced on great occasions, to give solemnity to the stories

<pb n="lviii"/>
with which they are associated; but are we to suppose Herodotus
holding his hand not merely in the first Book, where Spartan
kings now meet us for the first time, but throughout the fifth and
sixth Books, in which the inner history of Sparta, the fortunes of
the royal houses, and the succession of these very kings, Leonidas
and Leotychidas themselves, are in question, for the chance of
utilizing the Herakleid genealogies to elevate the stories of
Thermopylai and Mykale into a more heroic atmosphere? The
case of the Makedonian dynasty is not very dissimilar; and
here the pedigree is given, in the baldest and coldest style, as a
mere note or appendix to a brilliant story, which gains nothing
but a touch of legal formalism from the genealogical finale. The
context here encountered reaches further. In the eighth Book
(cc. 137-9) Herodotus tells the story of the origin of the
Makedonian monarchy, and explains the Hellenic descent of the
Makedonian kingly house from the Temenids of Argos. In the
fifth Book (c. 22) Herodotus tells a story, which records the
dispute at Olympia over the Hellenic claim of the Makedonian
house, and the decision in its favour, but there expressly postpones
the justification of the claim, and pledges himself to
relate it hereafter. What hypothesis better explains this curious
procedure than the supposition that, when Herodotus was writing
the fifth Book, the eighth Book, with the passage on the Hellenic
descent of Alexander embedded in it, was already in existence?</p>
<p>Within the class of cases now under review there is
none of higher evidential value than the excursus on the
origin of the Makedonian Royal House. There is, however,
another case of almost equal weight, save for two considerations:
the absence of the proleptic reference, and the possibility
that the whole passage is a later insertion, as a part of it
at least most certainly is, in the body of the seventh Book.
But to regard the whole passage as an insertion makes
its anachronistic introduction in its present context doubly
perplexing. In Book 6 c. 48 Herodotus records the mission
of heralds by King Dareios to the Greek states in 491 B.C.
demanding earth and water, but does not record the treatment,
good, bad or indifferent, which these heralds underwent in Athens
or in Sparta, nor does he even expressly record their arrival in
Athens, or in Sparta, at all. In Book 7 c. 133 an ever-memorable
account is given of the defiant outrage of which these royal
<pb n="lix"/>
messengers were the victims in Sparta, and in Athens likewise.
The historical merits of this account are not for the moment in
question: the present problem is to explain the occurrence of
this story in the seventh Book, out of its proper and obvious
connexion, rather than in the sixth Book, under the annals of
the year to which it chronologically and naturally belongs.
What simpler explanation for this anomaly can be suggested
than the hypothesis that the story had already been placed and
utilized by the author in the records of the Great Invasion to
explain the action of Xerxes (which, by the way, needed no such
explanation) in omitting to send heralds to Athens and Sparta
in 481 B.C.? If the whole story (cc. 133-7) were an insertion,
made at the last revision of his work by the author, it is hard to
see why it was inserted in the seventh Book rather than in the
sixth. The absence of a forward reference in the sixth Book,
which might certainly have been desirable, is yet easily intelligible:
Herodotus may have taken his record in Book 6 to imply that
heralds were sent to Sparta and Athens, as to other Greek states,
though the only one expressly named is Aigina, and that for a
reason immediately supplied by the context. A proleptic reference
to the sequel of the mission, the story of the reception, Herodotus
did not happen to insert, either in the first draft of the sixth
Book or on revision. Such references are quite exceptional
in his pages, and the wonder is rather that he gave one in the
case of Alexander than that he omitted one in the case of the
heralds. In Alexander's case, to be sure, an explanation for the
omission of the pertinent story was demanded by the argument
itself. But for the actual postposition of either story it is hard
to see any reason, except that each story was already, so to speak,
in type, in place, to wit, in what are now respectively the seventh
and eighth Books.</p>
<p>Other anomalies of the same kind, though more subtle in
degree, are best explained by the same hypothesis. Why is
there no adequate description of the forces of the whole empire,
which Dareios led with him into Thrake and Skythia, except that
the historian had already exhausted the subject, perhaps even
exploited the available sources, in describing the Host of Xerxes?
So likewise the description of the Bridges of Xerxes in the
seventh Book has rendered a description of the Bridges of Dareios
in the fourth Book superfluous. If we would know the states
<pb n="lx"/>
contributing to the Ionian fleet of Dareios on the Danube in
512 B.C. we must turn back, so to speak, to the Navy-list of
Xerxes in 480 B.C. Dareios sent many messages throughout
his empire; he was undoubtedly the reorganiser, if not the
inventor, of the Imperial postal system; but it is only in the eighth
Book (c. 98) that we read Herodotus' account of the Persian
courier service. It is not to be assumed that Herodotus has
always and everywhere made the best possible use of his
materials, or that accident had no part in shaping his results.
Many trifling anomalies may be left unaccounted for, or at least
refused independent weight in the argument; but the greater
anomalies establishing a presumption, the lesser fall into line iu
support of that presumption, and the presumption is in part
verified by insignificant details.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Adolph Bauer (<title>Die Entstehung

of the various <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/goi</foreign>.</p></note></p>
<p>So, finally, there is a class of cases, in themselves by no
means conclusive, although, as it seems, they were the first to
suggest the hypothesis of the priority in genesis, or composition,
of the last three Books over their preceders in the final achievement
of the work. A number of persons are introduced in the
seventh Book as though for the first time, partly by the terms
in which they are described, and partly by the employment of
the patronymic in connexion with their names. The use of the
patronymic has more than one purpose with Herodotus. He
undoubtedly employs it upon occasion to lend emphasis, to mark
a strong situation, to gain a rhetorical point, even as he may use
a pedigree or a family name for the same purpose. In some
cases recurrence of the patronymic may be due to the source
from which name and father's name have been taken over
together, without set purpose or significance. But the whole
object of such an employment would be lost if this use were not
exceptional, or if the presence and absence of the patronymic
were determined by purely casual motives. The rule undoubtedly
holds that the patronymic is used in introducing the person, and
then is dropped, unless occasion arise to distinguish two persons
of the same name, who might be confused, or for some other
special reason, as above indicated. If King Dareios is given his

<pb n="lxi"/>
patronymic in the opening words of Book 7, it is because there is
here a new beginning, or a fresh departure.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Contrast its absence in 1. 130.</p></note> Demaratos might,
perhaps, have had his father's name, without remark; but why
the details of his deposition and flight from Sparta if the seventh
Book originally, as now, came after the sixth, in which details
had just been given, making such a note quite unnecessary?
Mardonios, too, is described, not merely befathered, though we
are, on that hypothesis, just come from an important passage on
him in the sixth Book. The Peisistratidai make their appearance
in terms which read strangely, considering what a space they
have filled in the fifth and sixth Books; and the mention of
Hipparchos as ‘the son of Peisistratos’ after Book 5 is itself less
perplexing than the total omission in the seventh Book of any
mention of Hippias and his end—if at least Book 7 originally
succeeded Book 6 as a continuous record. Atossa and Artabanos,
Xanthippos and Alexander, Kadmos and Sophanes might be
names all occurring for the first time, as much as Themistokles
and Aristeides, Artabazos and Artemisia, or any of the numberless
personages proper to the story in these Books. The nett result
of such observations is to accentuate the impression of separateness,
distinction, independence, and priority claimed for these Books
on other grounds.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 For the instances of the use of the Patronymic cp. Index IV. <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign></p></note></p></div>

<head>Marks of successive Redactions in Bks. 7, 8, 9</head>
<p>The priority in genesis or composition here demanded
for the last three Books of Herodotus involves the recognition of
a redactive act, or series of acts, whereby these Books have been
combined with the other six, to form the existing whole. Whether
this literary fusion was achieved once for all, or resulted from
more than one revision or process of readjustment, is a problem the
solution of which depends partly upon the general theory of the
genesis of the whole work, and partly upon the actual evidences, or
marks, of revision, which may be detected, and with more or less
probability chronologized, within the volume here immediately in
view. The general priority of the last three Books over the first
six is more easily established than the respective order in composition
of those six Books, or their constituent parts. The all
but total absence in the last three Books of the notes of travel,
specially towards the East and South, makes heavily for the
original priority in the composition of this volume of the work.


<pb n="lxii"/>
Apparently when Herodotus first drafted the story of the Invasion
of Hellas by Xerxes his <title>Wanderjahre</title> had hardly begun, his major
journeys lay still before him, the Pontos, the West, Libya, Egypt,
Syria, were still unvisited. The first relatively completed draft of
the story of the Persian war was doubtless in the main calculated
for an Athenian audience; its tentative publication perhaps
brought our author the means and opportunity for those more
extensive voyages, the results of which are conspicuous in the
earlier Books, and more especially in the Skythian <title>Logoi.</title> There
are two fairly well attested and convincing <foreign rend="ital">points d'appui</foreign> in the
life and work of Herodotus—the voyage to the Pontos, and the
voyage or migration to Italy, the clearest traces of which are to
be found in the fourth Book; and these two points combine to
serve the theory of composition and redaction here propounded.
The association of the Skythian <title>Logoi</title> with the expedition of
Perikles into the Pontos in 443 B.C. is a thoroughly acceptable
suggestion, whatever precise rôle may be assigned to Herodotus
personally in connexion with that adventure.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. my <title>Herodotus IV.-VI.,</title> Introduction,
§ 21 (vol. i. pp. xc ff.).</p></note> The association
of his western migration, and consequent access to western
sources, with the Periklean settlement of Thurioi in 443 B.C., is
an ancient and long-established tradition in the biography of
Herodotus. The first drafts of much of the Hellenic <title>Logoi</title> now
preserved in the earlier Books, especially the histories of Athens,
Sparta, Korinth, may well date from Herodotus' first visit to the
mainland of Hellas. The Skythian <title>Logoi</title> cannot well be much
earlier in date than his migration to the West, and were perhaps
composed in the first instance for a western audience. Western
sources flow freely in the fourth Book, and it is only by an oversight
that their presence in the first Book can be denied,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. especially 1. 163, 165-7, also
c. 94.</p></note> while
their effect in the third Book, notably in its last section, is a
datum with which every theory of the genesis of the work has to
reckon. If Herodotus was ever resident in Thurioi, it can hardly
have been for long<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 For the history of Thurioi cp.
Busolt, <title>Gr. Gesch.</title> III. i. (1897) 518-40.
The settlement was hardly a success
from an Athenian point of view. The
total silence of Herodotus in regard
to Thurioi makes it less easy to believe
that he was actually one of the
colonists.</p></note>; and no positive proof of a visit to Syracuse,
or to Sicily, can be adduced; but, perhaps, enough time can be



<pb n="lxiii"/>
allowed in his western adventure to make room for what may
not inconveniently be termed a ‘Thurian redaction’ of his work.
Though the last three Books nowhere suggest extensive travels,
least of all in the East or South, yet a western deposit, presumably
due to his ‘Thurian’ migration, is incontestably present;
these Books have been revised in the interests of what we have
ventured to call ‘the Thurian redaction.’<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 The passage on Sicily, 7. 153-67,
contains much which is drawn from local
sources, notably, the story of Gelon's
rise, cc. 153-6; the story of Kadmos,
cc. 163 f.; the battle of Himera, cc.
165-7. Just thereafter <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ kata\ *(rhgi/nous
te kai\ *taranti/nous</foreign> is an obvious addition
(and note <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kamiko/n, th\n kat' e)me\

may underlie the note on the European
habitat of the lion, 7. 126, and the story
of Evenios, 9. 93-95.</p></note> It was this redaction
which first gave the work its full scope, its great width, its profound
unity; but it remains a difficult and delicate problem to
determine how much of the work, as it now exists, was incorporated
in this, its second and enlarged edition, so to speak. A revised
story of the Invasion of Xerxes was there; the antecedents of
the war were there; the earlier history of the Greek states, the
earlier history of the Persian empire, the attempted conquest of
Europe by Dareios, the Ionian revolt, the Marathonian campaign,
perhaps all of these. It is easier to say, with confidence, what
was not yet to be found in the work. The Lydian <title>Logoi</title> were
perhaps already involved with the <foreign rend="ital">origines</foreign> of the Persian power;
but not the Libyan <title>Logoi,</title> still less the Egyptian. The second
Book of Herodotus contains (as I believe) the key to the position,
and points to the right solution of the problems of composition,
genesis, and redaction presented by the work. The higher
criticism has tended recently to date the Egyptian visit of
Herodotus, and consequently the composition of the second Book,
relatively late, but not quite late enough. Let the visit to Egypt
be placed after the western adventure, yes, if you will, on the
way back from Italy to Athens, and the composition of the work
of Herodotus falls into the better perspective.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Edward Meyer (<title>Forschungen,</title> i.
(1892) 155) has well seen that Hdt 's
visit to Egypt falls relatively late: he
dates it “about 440 B C.,” after the historian's
return from Thurioi to Athens.
I should rather suggest that Hdt. visited
Egypt (and then Tyre, cp. 2. 44) after
leaving Thurioi but before returning to
Athens (possibly taking Kyrene on
the way, 2. 181). However that may
be, the composition of the Egyptian
<title>Logoi</title> falls late in the genesis of Hdt.'s
work. Bk. 2 was composed after Bk. 3,
cp. 2. 38 and 3. 28 (for, if 3. 28 was not
already in existence, why not include
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">shmh/ia</foreign> in 2. 38?). Bk. 2 was composed
after Bk. 1 (cp. 2. 100 with 1.
185-7). Bk. 2 was composed after Bk.
4 (2. 161, 4. 159). The fourth Bk.
is of cardinal importance to the argument,
as the <title>Skythian Logoi</title> were plainly
written, or written up, in the West, and
western sources flow freely also in the
<title>Libyan Logoi,</title> presumably composed
afterwards: the analogies between the
<title>Egyptian</title> and the <title>Libyan Logoi</title> are
strong. ‘Western’ sources show themselves
in Bk. 2, notably in cc. 10 (the
Echinades), 33 (the course of the
Danube), 52, 55 (Hdt. in Dodona), perhaps
in c. 81 (Pythagorean orgies).
Assuming an affinity, or similar interest,
between ‘Egyptian’ and ‘Assyrian’
<title>Logoi,</title> the unfulfilled promises in regard
to the latter (1. 106, 184) bring the
composition of the <title>Egyptian Logoi</title> down
to the end of Hdt.'s literary labours.
Bk. 2 is fatal to the unity and continuity
of the Herodotean composition:
it is practically a separate treatise; it
could never have formed an original
part of the continuous argument, or
ground-plan of the work; its insertion,
as an afterthought, is to be justified as
furnishing a balance, so far as mere bulk
is concerned, to the Beginning of the
work as against the Middle and the
End, cp. § 6, p. xxxvii <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></note> The second


<pb n="lxiv"/>
revision or enlargement of the plan of the work, ‘the Thurian
redaction,’ was not final: a later handling, probably again in
Athens, incorporated the Egyptian <title>Logoi</title> in the first section of
the work, perhaps appended the Libyan <title>Logoi</title> to the second, and
to the third added at least those rarer touches which belong
chronologically to the opening years of the Peloponnesian war,
and which, in the case of the last three Books, are separated from
the great mass of contemporary references by so considerable an
interval.</p>
<p>It is most important to realize that the general priority in the
composition of the last three Books is a far simpler and more easily
admitted conclusion than any view of the order and dates in the
composition of the first six Books, or their constituent parts, and
the precise times and places of the successive redactions by which
such disparate elements were fused into a relatively continuous
and complete whole. In regard to the last three Books, with
which this Introduction specifically deals, the evidences of revision,
even of successive revisions, can hardly be gainsaid. The
gap in the references to contemporary events proves it. How is
that gap to be explained if the whole sum and substance of the
last three Books was being written down by the author in its
present form about, or just after, the date of the three isolated
references to ‘the Ten Years' War’? Moreover, the signs of
successive revision are apparent in the prevailing tone and point
of view of the general narrative, as well as in the patent stratification
of several distinct passages. The general tone and tendency
<pb n="lxv"/>
of the Books suggest a date for their composition before the
middle of the fifth century, while the particular marks of revision
point down as late as the Archidamian War. The great mass of
references to events of the <title>Pentekontaeteris</title> belong, as already
pointed out, to a date before the middle of the fifth century. To
that period may be referred the original draft of the story of the
war—a subject for which domestic and Asianic sources would be
largely available, and which Herodotus might easily have projected
before leaving Halikarnassos, and executed, at least in part,
without travelling further than Samos. The war, indeed, is
already a matter of history; the chief agents in it are no more.
Xerxes, Pausanias, Themistokles, Aristeides, are as dead as
Leonidas and Mardonios. It is not so clear whether Alexander
of Makedon was still alive when the first or second draft of the
story was made: his successor is never mentioned, and the
omission of all reference to the Odrysai among the Thrakians
would be almost inexplicable if the passages on Thrake had been
written after the rise of that tribe to supremacy. Herodotus
must have found out before the completion even of the first draft
of his story that, although he could get on fairly well with the
account of naval operations, including Mykale, or even with the
march of Xerxes as far as Thermopylai, perhaps as far as Athens,
yet for his account of the preparations of the Greeks, for the
campaign on land, for Thermopylai, above all for the story of
Plataia, a journey to Athens, to Sparta, to Delphi, to Thebes,
perhaps further afield, was desirable. It may be that a considerable
interval elapsed between the original composition of the
earlier parts of the story and its first provisional completion, a
labour perhaps accomplished before the death of Kimon, if not
before the death of Alexander of Makedon. Athens is evidently
growing in unpopularity: the rehabilitation of Argos is in progress,
that of Delphi is a <foreign rend="ital">fait accompli,</foreign> but Thebes has hardly
yet emerged from the cloud, and though the breach between
Athens and Sparta has taken place, and the battle of Tanagra
had been fought, the battle of Koroneia, with its momentous consequences,
is still in the future. There are no true notes of a
‘Periklean redaction’ of the Persian war-story in the last three
Books of Herodotus. The son of Xanthippos is not so much as
named; the Periklean disdain for the Eastern question would have
been fatal to the Herodotean logography: Herodotus writes for a
<pb n="lxvi"/>
public that still regards the Barbarian as its chief enemy. The
argument from silence, from omissions, must not be pressed; the
subject and the sources will here account for so much; yet it is
to be observed that the special notes of the Periklean policy,
resumed from Themistokles, anti-Lakonism, ‘Medism,’ the
Empire, are not found in these Books, or only found in some of
those passages which have been inserted on revision, and furnish
forth the cumulative proof of re-editing and redaction.</p>
<p>The list of such particular passages is a lengthy one, especially
for the seventh Book, and some show traces of more than one
retractation. Such a passage is (1) the highly composite passage,
which connects the first and second parts of Book 7, and especially
cc. 133-137, characterized by the author himself as a digression,
and bearing the marks of more than one revision. Such again
are (2) the passage on the geography of Thessaly, 7. 128-130;
(3) the digression on Argos, 7. 150-152; (4) the Sikeliote history,
7. 153-167; (5) the notes on Doriskos, 7. 106; (6) the king's
high-way in Thrace, 7. 115; (7) the habitat of the lion, 7. 126;
(8) the insertion (<foreign xml:lang="greek">parenqh/kh</foreign>) on Mikythos, or the war between
Rhegion and the Tarentines, 7. 170; (9) the geographical notes on
Thermopylai, 7. 176, and so forth. Moreover, many of the
passages on Thessaly, on Athens, on Delphi have the appearance
of insertions, or additions at second or third hand; e.g. (10) the
story of the expedition to Tempe, 7. 172, 173; (11) the oracle of
the winds, 7. 178; (12) the defence of Athens, 7. 139. To
these instances of addition, retractation, from the seventh Book,
which might probably be increased, may be added some further
ones from Books 8 and 9; (13) the deliverance of Delphi, 8.
36-39; (14) the guardian of the Akropolis, 8. 41; (15) the
Athenian exiles on the Akropolis, 8. 54, 55; (16) the oracle of
Bakis, 8. 77 (perhaps other citations of the Boiotian seer should
be added); (17) the Delphian column, 8. 82; (18) the apparition
at Salamis, 8. 84 ad f.; (19) a variant story of the flight of
Xerxes, 8. 118-120; (20) the siege of Poteidaia, 8. 126-129;
(21) Mardonios and the Oracles, 8. 133-135; (22) the origin of
the Makedonian monarchy, 8. 137-139. From the ninth Book
may be added: (23) the story of Teisamenos, 9. 33-35; (24) the
correct exegesis of an oracle, 9. 43; (25) the note on Dekeleia,
9. 73; (26) the story of Evenios, 9. 93, 94. The great majority
of these passages belong to the ‘second draft’; only definite
<pb n="lxvii"/>
references to the Peloponnesian, i.e. Archidamian war, can be
admitted as additions at third hand, or on final revision. The list
of insertions and additions in the second draft might probably be
considerably enlarged, but a <foreign rend="ital">caveat</foreign> may here be entered against
gratuitous anachronisms, and the exaggerated suspicion of contemporary
reference. If any stratum in these Books belongs to
the original draft, it is the series of passages in which Demaratos
figures; and the remark put into his mouth with reference to the
island of Kythera is no more a reflexion of the achievement of
Nikias<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.53-57">Thucyd. 4. 53-57</bibl>.</p></note> in 424 B.C. than the phrases <foreign xml:lang="greek">periple/ein *pelopo/nnhson</foreign>
(7. 236) or <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/ma tw=| e)/ari peira=sqai th=s *peloponnh/sou</foreign> (8. 113)
are borrowed from the Athenian strategics of the Archidamian
war; nor is it possible to bring down the final revision of these
Books, and therewith the publication of the work as a whole, much
below the date of the last clear reference to the events of that war.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. further, Index IV. <foreign rend="ital">sub vv.</foreign> Composition, Draft, etc.</p></note></p></div>
<div type="section" n="10">
<head>The Sources: analysis inconclusive</head>
<p>General analyses and discussions on the <title>Sources</title> of
Herodotus are disappointing and inconclusive; nor is the secret of
this disappointment far to seek. The work is too large and
complex, its parts are too diverse in character and origin, for
generalizations, based upon the indiscriminate citation of verses, or
evidential items from the whole work <foreign rend="ital">passim,</foreign> to be convincing.
A critique and evaluation of the Sources to be satisfactory must be
conducted on such a scale as to be exhaustive. Moreover, the
historical appreciation of the contents of the work, as attempted
for example in the Appendices of the present edition, requires
constant reference to the particular Sources of particular passages,
and supersedes the attempt at a general and vaguer analysis.
Yet, for particular Books, or groups of Herodotean <title>Logoi,</title> each
with a predominant character of its own, something by way of a
general account of the Sources may within reasonable compass be
profitably achieved; and this Introduction to the three last Books,
which deal with the story of the Great Invasion, a story comprising
but two or three years as its chronological condition, and a
comparatively limited area for its geographical scenes, would be
incomplete without some attempt to deal generally with the
question of the Sources from which the narrative was derived.
Those Sources can only have been of three kinds: (i.) <foreign rend="ital">autopsis,</foreign> or
personal inspection; (ii.) hearsay or tradition; (iii.) documentary


<pb n="lxviii"/>
or literary evidence. Even such a classification is apt to be
fallacious, especially in connexion with the work of Herodotus.
The line between a monument and an inscribed monument is
somewhat evanescent: the difference between a description based
upon eyesight in the first degree and in the second is not always
easy to detect; the affidavits of the agent and of the agent's family,
or friends, are sometimes curiously stratified. Herodotus himself
rarely draws clear distinctions between the specific categories of
historical evidence.</p>
<p>(i.) The precipitation of the element of <foreign rend="ital">autopsis,</foreign> personal
inspection, in the seventh, eighth and ninth Books of Herodotus
involves, as in the case of every part of his work, the evidences
of his own movements, travels and researches. Now, apart
from the suggestions, or rather confirmation, of a voyage, or
migration, to the west, you would hardly discover or even
suspect from the contents of these Books that Herodotus had
been a great traveller in his day. Nothing suggests the visit
to Egypt, or the voyage in the Pontos. There is no hint of
the writer's having seen Susa or Babylon, though both are
mentioned in these Books. The Kyrenaica is conspicuous by its
absence. Even the scenes in Sardes, and on the route of Xerxes
in lower Asia, show little or nothing that might not be put down
to fairly vivid but secondary Sources. It would be pleasant to
picture Herodotus tracing in person the route of Xerxes from the
still unidentified Kritalla to Sardes, or even from Sardes to the
Hellespont, and there would be no great extravagance in the
supposition, at least so far as relates to the latter stage; but it is
just here that we find it especially difficult to detect Herodotus in
person. At some time or other Herodotus beheld Abydos, but
apparently not before he had drafted his account of the march of
Xerxes. It is much easier to carry, or to follow, Herodotus by
sea than by land from his native Halikarnassos round the
Aigaian world; and, except in the Hellenic peninsula and in
the valley of the Nile, he scarcely penetrates inland. These
Books may be taken to show, or to suggest, <foreign rend="ital">autopsy</foreign> for
Samos,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 e.g. in the Army and Navy Lists, in
the story of Mykale, etc. Cp. 8. 85.</p></note> Athens,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 The precision of the Attic topography,

be pressed; cp. 9. 25, 109.</p></note> Argos,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 148.</p></note> and other places in Greece proper. The proof
that Herodotus visited Plataia, or the battle-field, before drafting
his account of the battle is not convincing; but, as he certainly
saw Thebes at some period of his career,<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 Cp 5. 59.</p></note> he probably saw Plataia,
and wrote, or revised, the story of the campaign, with the advantage
of a tardy visit to the scene, though without a clear or full
perception of the strategic and tactical problems involved in his
own narrative.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 Cp. Appendix VIII. § 3.</p></note> The gross blunder in the orientation of Thermopylai
makes it very difficult to believe that Herodotus had
studied that story of Spartan heroism <foreign rend="ital">an Ort und Stelle,</foreign> even
though points in the narrative, or topography, are extremely
graphic.<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 7. 176.</p></note> The description of Thessaly, as seen from the neighbourhood
of Tempe, has suggested to more than one reader the
idea that Herodotus convoyed Xerxes from Therme to Tempe,
because he had performed the voyage himself, and the passage
has ‘notes’ of <foreign rend="ital">autopsis</foreign> about it besides its graphic force.<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 7. 128, 129</p></note>
If so, Herodotus' problematic visit might be connected with
his traditional residence at the Makedonian court; but the
alleged residence at the Makedonian court is itself probably
only an inference from the evidence afforded by the
work, particularly in the eighth and ninth Books, of an
admiration for Alexander, a special interest in his achievements.<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 Suidas: <foreign xml:lang="greek">tine\s de\ e)n *pe/llh| au)to\n

‘Poteidaian,’ 8. 129.</p></note>
Athens, Delphi, Olympia, all might have supplied evidences and
sources sufficient to account for the colour and warmth of
Herodotus' notices of the Makedonian monarch. There are
many vivid touches in the Makedonian and in the Thrakian
geography of these Books<note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 e.g. 7. 115 <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n de\ o(do\n tau/thn, th=|

be had for the asking, and there was no district better known in
Athens than the tributary Thrakian region. The older geography
of Hekataios was especially bright and copious in the north
Aigaian. A serious blunder in regard to Chalkidike<note anchored="true" n="9"><p>9 7. 22, 122 (with notes <foreign rend="ital">ad ll.</foreign>).</p></note> undoes the
impression made by the descriptions of the canal, of Poteidaia, of
the neighbourhood of Therme; and the too graphic touch on the









<pb n="lxx"/>

and precise at second hand.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 126.</p></note> If Herodotus had personal knowledge
of ‘Thrake,’ it is most natural to connect his Thrakian
experiences with his visit to the Pontos, and not unreasonable to
date that voyage later than the first draft of these Books, a view
which harmonizes well with the non-appearance of the Odrysai
in this volume.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. 4. 92.</p></note> But, however the vision of ‘Thrake’ be dated,
it is rash to infer that the geography of the region is in the main
based on personal observation, rather than on the copious Sources,
of various kinds, available for the purpose.</p>
<p>(ii.) Apart from the advantage to his geographical and
topographical data, and the vivifying effect on a narrative of
events due to acquaintance with the scenes of action, the vast
gain to Herodotus from his travels in the Greek world arose
from the numerous opportunities afforded him of contact and
conversation with men of various tribes and cities who had
taken part in the war, upon the one side or the other. Besides
what the actors themselves still had to say, there were doubtless
strong local traditions in various places, and among the rising
generation, in respect to the parts played by the various cities
and powers of Greece throughout the great struggle. It would
no doubt have been possible, in the time of Herodotus, to
compile a history of the war purely based upon oral traditions,
and to have gathered those traditions largely on the Asianic
main. Such a history might have borne a marked resemblance,
in ensemble and in details, to the actual work of Herodotus in
this part. There is no equal section of his history where the
terminology of oral tradition is so strong and patent, or where,
failing exact and decisive terms, the general indications and
conditions point so clearly as in the three last Books to the
living voice as the main source of the writer's knowledge.
Over and above such cases the catalogue of passages based on
oral tradition may fairly be enlarged by referring thereto
every story, or paragraph, for which a scriptural source is not
distinctly preferable. It is a curious fact that Herodotus has
explicitly named as an informant, and for a comparatively
trivial occasion, but one person, that one happily contemporary
with the war.<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 Thersander, 9. 16.</p></note> As little as one such reference can represent



<pb n="lxxi"/>
the contact of Herodotus with the men who had actually taken
part in the war, so little perhaps do the explicit notes of oral
information represent the actual mass of materials due to this
source in the pages of Herodotus. Waiving the terms, which
are ambiguous (<foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos, le/getai, le/gousi, fasi/ ktl.</foreign>), and used
indifferently of oral and of written information,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. my <title>Hdt. IV.-VI.,</title> Introduction,

easily proved again from Bks. 7-9.
Thus (i.) <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos, le/gein</foreign>, etc., are used freely

in these Books more generally of oral than of written
information, there are not much more than ten or twelve
passages in which unambiguous or explicit reference is
made to an oral source (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)koh/</foreign>). Six times the express use of
the term for hearing (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)kou/ein</foreign>) guarantees the presence of firsthand
oral information<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 35 (branding the Hellespont),

the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">punqa/nomai</foreign> can be thrown into the same scale, the
total of such references may amount to the baker's dozen.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 7. 114 (cruelty of Amastris in her old

(names of the Three Hundred Spartans)
must surely go back to an inscription.
7. 233 (anecdote of Gorgo) is probably
spurious.</p></note> For
the most part, be it observed, the passages so marked record
comparatively trifling circumstances to which Herodotus attaches
little importance. The chief exception is signalized not by the
terms employed, but by the express nomination of his informant.
We dare not infer from this paucity of reference that Herodotus
had documentary or written authority for all the rest. The
nature of the case, the character of the story in itself, Herodotus'
own date and the evidences of his travels, all go to prove page
after page of these Books the first literary redaction of the
living voices of men. The Halikarnassian speaks in the exploits

information, even in the last three Books of his work, which














<pb n="lxxiii"/>
Herodotus has drawn from literary sources, from documents and
authorities of one kind or another, other than the living voice of
the actors and spectators of the great war, has been greatly
under-estimated by many recent critics. There is a great deal
of substance in the last three Books of Herodotus besides the
bare story of the war, and belonging to other departments
where learned or poetic pens had long been busy. A deal of
matter in these Books, notably in the Army and Navy Lists,
was ancient history to Herodotus himself: legends, myths,
traditions of migrations, colonization, settlements, foundations,
which had all received treatment from poets and logographers,
whose works Herodotus is innocently exploiting as a matter
of course. Herodotus was not the first man to commit to
writing the Achaimenid pedigree, or the genealogies of the
royal houses of Sparta and of Pella. His geography and
ethnography he had neither to discover for himself, nor to take
simply on hearsay: there was a considerable geographical literature
in existence, and a good deal of his material he found ready to
hand in the works of Hekataios, and perhaps of others. But it
may be thought that such matters, though not inconsiderable,
only bear remotely, if at all, on the story of the war. There
were documents of various kinds in existence concerning the
war: the war had already, and almost immediately, created a
literature of its own. Some critics write, or speak, as though it
were much to the credit of Herodotus to have neglected all
that, and begun <foreign rend="ital">de novo,</foreign> as though to glean the oral tradition and
ignore the written word were a special merit in the historian.
Strange aberration! We should feel more complete confidence
in Herodotus could we be assured that he had made a systematic
study of all that had already been written about the war, and
had examined all available documents dating from the war period
itself. It is all to his credit if, scanty as are the materials
for comparison, and slight as are the hints afforded by his own
methods and result, we can yet perceive that he did not wholly
ignore what others had done before him, or disdain the monuments
of the war, the history whereof he undertook to write.
Any one can see that Herodotus must have had access to
written collections of Oracles, as well Delphic as less august
vaticinations,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Musaios, 7. 6 (8. 96), 9. 43; Bakis, 8. 20, 77, 96; 9. 43; Lysistratos,
8. 96; Delphic, 7. 140-1 (twenty-four
lines), 148 (three lines), 220 (seven lines);
7. 178; 8. 36; 9. 33, 42. Oracles committed
to writing, 7. 142, 8. 135. <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gia</foreign>,
8. 62, 141; 9. 42. Cp. also 7. 76, 117,
197; 8. 83, 133 ff.; 9. 93.</p></note> but there the recognition of written sources

<pb n="lxxiv"/>
appears for some critics to stop. None will be rash enough
to claim for him an inspection of the king's despatch to
Mardonios, dramatically reproduced by Alexander,<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 8. 140.</p></note> and even the
tablet of Demaratos has a somewhat apocryphal air about it.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 239.</p></note>
Herodotus might easily report the inscriptions of Themistokles
without having actually seen them <foreign rend="ital">in situ,</foreign><note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 8. 22.</p></note> and the <title>Apographai</title>
and <title>Anagraphai</title> of the Royal Scribes would have been indecipherable
to him, even if he could ever have had them in his
hands.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 7. 100; 8. 90.</p></note> But his chronology, as far as it goes, is based at least
in part upon official documents, for example the list of Attic
Archons. His Army and Navy Lists, however composite, must
go back ultimately to authoritative documents. He had seen
many monuments of the war, tombs, <foreign rend="ital">stelai,</foreign> votive offerings, and
he had surely not merely heard what was said of them, but
copied all that was written upon them.<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 (7. 30), 7. 189, 228; 8. 82; cf. 9.
91; 7. 190; 8. 115, 120. 121-2; 9. 70,
81, 85, 121.</p></note> The epigrams of
Simonides were to be read all over the Greek world, and not his
epigrams alone.<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 Cp. Appendix I. § 3.</p></note> He and the other poets had been busy with the
war.<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 <foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign></p></note> It is not fanciful to trace some items in Herodotus to the
Attic <title>Skolia.</title><note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 9. 74.</p></note> We can see the legend of Themistokles growing
under the malignant pen of Timokrates; and the stories of
Themistokles told by Herodotus have already suffered from such
pens.<note anchored="true" n="9"><p>9 Appendix I. § 3.</p></note> Aischylos and Phrynichos had both celebrated events of
the war upon the stage, long before Herodotus committed the
facts to prose.<note anchored="true" n="10"><p>10 <foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign></p></note> The debt of Herodotus to Aischylos is admitted,
though it concerns rather the spirit than the letter, the moral
rather than the material of the story, making us moderns, with
our precise habit in the weighing of evidence, wonder more at a
difference in the legends of Salamis than at a resemblance in the
portraits of Xerxes. Had we more of the poetry of the fifth
century in our hands we should probably find a still larger debt, in
form and in substance, to its credit with Herodotus. A writer of
large range and experience has thought it “not unlikely” that
the story of the Greek embassy to Gelon came “from a play of










<pb n="lxxv"/>
Epicharmos.”<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 E. A. Freeman, <title>Hist. of Sicily,</title> ii.

Herodotus from earlier literature, as well as some moral philosophy.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 7. 125 (camels and lions); 7. 129

Was there no genuine historical literature connected
with the war? It is generally admitted that ‘the Hellenes,’ who
had, according to Herodotus, turned the name of Masistios into
Makistios, were writers.<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 9. 20.</p></note> The admission is a far-reaching one:
the authors are plural, and their concern is the Persian war.
Was not Dionysios of Miletos one of their number?<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 Cp. Appendix I. § 2.</p></note> If we
cannot further verify the details, we must at least concede the
principle, that even the story of the war had for Herodotus its
literary sources. The attempt to identify one such source with
the exiled Athenian Dikaios has not been generally regarded as
successful; but the suggestion was a legitimate one, and its chief
defects lay in undertaking to realize too definitely the contents of
the <title>Memoirs,</title> and to confine too narrowly Herodotus' fountains of
knowledge.<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 P. Trautwein, “Die Memoiren des
Dikaios, eine Quelle des Herodoteischen

Appendix I. § 2.</p></note> The art of Herodotus, which has cast the glamour of the
living voice over the most disparate materials, makes it difficult
to determine nicely the exact quality of his several Sources, or
the precise provenience of every chapter in his work.<note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 An ‘Artabazos-Quelle’ has long been

his authority, while compelled to admit that his work is largely
derived from mere hearsay, and that he has allowed himself a
very wide literary licence in dealing with his materials, will be
especially glad to detect any signs the work may contain, that
the author realized the obligation he was under to acquaint
himself, so far as might be, with all the literature and documents

<head>Defects and Merits of Herodotus <foreign rend="ital">historicus</foreign> as exhibited in Bks. 7, 8, 9</head>
<p>To the analysis of the Sources naturally succeeds the
estimate of the historian's power of dealing with them, and
generally the merits and defects of his mind and method, as
exhibited in the work, or the portion of the work, here immediately
under review. No ancient historian was really a scientific and
critical historian, as these terms are nowadays understood:
Thucydides himself will not stand untarnished the tests of the
modern analyst. Ancient historians take liberties in the interests
of art, of charm, of literature, which modern historiography has
discarded, and modern students would not appreciate if revived
or imitated. Nevertheless, ancient historians are critical and
competent in widely varying degrees, and their works, tried by
their own best standards, as by ours, deserve careful and discriminating
appreciation. Herodotus has a unique character of
his own, which nowhere shows to greater advantage than in
these Books. To an incomparable style, combined with a happy
empiricism which allows, or seems to allow, every party to a suit
to tell its own story, he adds a critical effort or rational conscience,
not always advertised, and an honesty, or open-mindedness, which
outshines the ‘malignity’ of his Sources. If he seeks after
signs and wonders, and prefers proverbial wisdom and <foreign rend="ital">bons mots</foreign>
to metaphysic, his work is possibly none the worse a mirror of
the times for that. His rationale of political action, his grasp of
the operations of war, are seldom adequate to our way of thinking;
yet he often enables us to correct or to supplement his own
account from the context. His chronology nowhere else so nearly
responds to modern requirements as in the last three Books; the
topographical conditions of the story of the war are remarkably

<pb n="lxxvii"/>
well satisfied, while incidentally a large contribution is made to
the materials of ‘Comparative Jurisprudence,’ or the early history
of Institutions. Exaggerations, inconsistencies, fictions abound
in his pages; yet this ‘liberty of prophesying,’ as he practises
it, carries to some extent its own remedy with it, and detracts
surprisingly little from the purely historical results to be obtained.
A more detailed discussion of the points just formulated will go
far to justify the favourable verdict.</p>
<p>(i.) That liberty which Herodotus, in common with most
ancient historians, carried with him into his composition, may be
most significantly tested by an examination of the speeches and
dialogues plentifully introduced into the last three Books of the
work.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 There are about 120 <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/goi, paraine/seis,
gnw=mai</foreign> in these three Books
which might come under this head:
the more considerable are individually
specified below.</p></note> From the purely critical point of view perhaps the best to
be said for them is that they are not quite all equally unauthentic
and fictitious. In some cases there may be a genuine reminiscence
of words spoken on the given occasion; yet, even in passages
apparently the most plausible, the language has taken on so
strong an Herodotean colour that we cannot see in Herodotus a
mere reporter: he has arranged the matter for publication, and
the full copyright is his. Thersander of Orchomenos doubtless
told to Herodotus the anecdote of his experiences at the banquet
of Attaginos, but the conversation of Thersander with his Persian
<foreign rend="ital">convive</foreign> has a native Herodotean ring, which makes it, in its present
form, unmistakeably the author's; unless, indeed, Herodotus learnt
a good deal of his own philosophy from the Boiotian.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 9. 16. (Is the prominence of the
Boiotian Bakis due to Thersander?)</p></note> Even less
convincing is the conversation between Dikaios and Demaratos
in the Thriasian plain on the eve of the battle of Salamis, for the
substance of which Herodotus is nevertheless at some pains
to specify his source.<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 8. 65.</p></note> Few if any of the remaining dialogues
and conversations have an alleged authority; not seldom the
circumstances and conditions in which the speeches are introduced,
no less than their substance or contents, prohibit their acceptance.
The situation is frequently private and confidential, the interlocutors
Persians, and the conversation of course <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign>
conducted in Persian though reported in Greek. Improbabilities,
inconsequences, even absurdities, occur in the conversations and



<pb n="lxxviii"/>
speeches, which it is much more natural to ascribe to the reporter,
or inventor, than to the hypothetical interlocutors. It will be
hard for any one to gainsay the free creative action of the historian
in regard to the deliberations of Xerxes and his councillors. The
two speeches of Mardonios, the three speeches of Artabanos, the
four speeches of Xerxes, which preface the final decision for war,
can hardly be more authentic than the dreams and apparitions
which the historian employs to overcome the king's reluctance
to decide for war.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7 5-18. Cp. Appendix II. § 2 (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>).</p></note> The dialogue of Xerxes and Artabanos at
Abydos is but a vehicle for Greek sentiment and ethics concerning
the life of man, for a criticism on the Persian conduct of the war,
placed in the lips of these <foreign rend="ital">dramatis personae</foreign> without any apparent
historical justification.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 46-52 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">bioth=s a(nqrwphi/hs pe/ri</foreign> c. 46&lt;*&gt;

<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ th=s strathlasi/hs</foreign> cc 46-52).</p></note> Some readers may be tempted to ascribe
a higher degree of probability to the three conversations reported
between Xerxes and Demaratos, in view of this or that special
source connected with the exiled Spartan king, and presumably
accessible to Herodotus.<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 (i.) At Doriskos, 7. 101-104; (ii.) at
Thermopylai, before the engagements,
7. 209, (iii.) at Thermopylai, after the
engagements, 7. 234-7.</p></note> Such a source might help doubtless to
explain the prominence of Demaratos in the historian's pages
(where he succeeds Artabanos in the character of Choregos, or
Sage); but the substance of the supposed conversations discredits
their historical claim. The first and second interviews are
transparent devices for expounding in dramatic form Hellenic,
and especially Lakedaimonian, traits and qualities, the better to
explain and to glorify the defence of Greece; the third is a no
less transparent device for conveying a criticism upon the
Persian strategy or plan of campaign: here the Persian admiral,
Achaimenes, appears as tritagonist, in order to provide a spokesman
for the alternative actually followed, and to explain why the
Persians failed to adopt a course of action only too likely to have
been successful. Probably differences of opinion existed in the
king's suite upon the conduct of operations; courses recommended
by Greek exiles, who knew their own countrymen, might, if
adopted, have furthered the king's cause; but a good deal of the
criticism, thus dramatically represented, may be the result of
afterthought, on both sides, coming to the historian ready-made,
and owing to him little more than its dramatic form and



<pb n="lxxix"/>
hypostatization. Even the prominence of Artemisia in the King's
councils before and after the battle of Salamis cannot be construed
into an authentication of the speeches, reported for these occasions<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Before, 8. 68; after, 8. 102.</p></note>;
and the remarks fathered on Xerxes at Tempe,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 130.</p></note> though doubtless
illustrative of the despotic mind, are as fictitious in this connexion
as his conversations with Pythios,<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 7. 27-9, 38-9.</p></note> which subserve the same
general purpose.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 At Alos his ‘Guides’ are made to
report to Xerxes the legend of Athamas,
7. 197.</p></note></p>
<p>On the Greek side, where assuredly there was no lack of
speechifying in real life, Herodotus to a great extent has avoided
reporting set speeches, or contented himself with the <foreign rend="ital">oblique
oration</foreign> in reporting them. Given cases make all the better
impression for this abstinence, the feeling produced being that
the historian reports the point and marrow of arguments which
were used, must have been used, or might have been used, upon the
occasion. So with the speeches at Athens,<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 7. 143-4.</p></note> at the Isthmos,<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 7. 145, cp. 8. 3.</p></note> before
the war: so with the <title>Parainesis</title> of Themistokles to the <title>Epibatai</title>
on the very morning of the battle of Salamis,<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 8. 83, one of the most authenticlooking
reports in Hdt.</p></note> or the discussion
with Eurybiades thereafter.<note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 8. 108.</p></note> Where Herodotus breaks into <foreign rend="ital">direct
oration</foreign> professing to give the <foreign rend="ital">ipsissima verba</foreign> of his speakers,
the reports become more and more incredible. The largest set
piece of this kind on the Greek side is the interview between
the Greek ambassadors and Gelon, the tyrant of Syracuse,
where the speeches are no doubt the vehicles for a good
deal of candid criticism, very much in place in the historian's
pages, under one form or another, but not at all likely to have
been uttered by the given speakers upon the given occasion.<note anchored="true" n="9"><p>9 7. 157-62.</p></note>
The debates of the Greek Strategoi before Salamis are reported
partly in ‘oblique,’ partly in ‘direct oration’; and it may safely
be said that the former passages have more verisimilitude
than the latter.<note anchored="true" n="10"><p>10 8. 49, 56-62, 74, 78-81. For
Artemision cp. 8. 19.</p></note> The principal set speech of Themistokles
contains, indeed, an admirable argumentation, but the arguments
must have been used much earlier than the point at which they
occur in the historian's narrative<note anchored="true" n="11"><p>11 8. 60.</p></note>; while the interview and
dialogue between Themistokles and Aristeides is transparent











<pb n="lxxx"/>
fiction.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 8. 79, 80.</p></note> The discussion in the council of war at Andros,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 8. 108.</p></note> like
the discussion in the council of war at Samos,<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 9. 106.</p></note> both reported
in <foreign rend="ital">oblique oration,</foreign> contain at least veritable points of dispute,
doubtless at issue and debated on the occasion; but the
larger set speeches, of Alexander, the Spartans, the Athenians,
on the question of an Athenian union with the Persian, are quite
unacceptable in their actual form.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 8. 140-4.</p></note> More plausible are the
speeches, briefly reported, in Lakedaimon soon afterwards<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 9. 7-11.</p></note>; but
the great orations of the Tegeatai and Athenians on the battlefield
of Plataia, whatever the historical incident that lurks hid
in the situation, are plainly out of place and time.<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 9. 26-7.</p></note> To what
category must the short oration of the Korkyraians before Xerxes
be assigned which is reported <foreign rend="ital">ipsissimis verbis</foreign> albeit <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign>
never delivered?<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 7. 168.</p></note> To the same category as the message of
Themistokles to Xerxes, addressed by the lips of a messenger
warranted to keep silence in regard to his trust even in the
extremity of torture!<note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 8. 110.</p></note> Many speeches, reported by Herodotus,
are reducible to messages on the battle-field, or diplomatic <foreign rend="ital">pourparlers,</foreign>
where the substance is plainly or plausibly historical, and
the form is comparatively unimportant; others dwindle to the
dimensions and purpose of <foreign rend="ital">bons mots</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ph eu)= ei)rhme/na</foreign>), with an
immortal right to exist, whatever their unauthenticity!<note anchored="true" n="9"><p>9 Cp. p. lxix note 3 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></note></p>
<p>Doubtless for the contents of many of the speeches reproduced
in his pages Herodotus had what he believed to be sufficient
justification in the reports or traditions that had reached him
orally, or in writing. In other cases, doubtless, he has more or
less consciously followed the principle formulated by Thucydides,
to ‘put into the mouth of each speaker the sentiments (and
ideas) proper to the occasion.’ This principle is, however, one
no longer consistent with the practice of the historical muse:
it marks a method which even the most rhetorical historiography
of our days will not adopt, despite the examples of Herodotus
and Thucydides, of Livy and Tacitus. It is a method confined
in our literature to the historical novelist, so called. In some
of the cases above cited it is employed by Herodotus with a
freedom which astonishes us even in the pages of an ancient
author; and such action makes it very difficult for us to suppose









<pb n="lxxxi"/>
that this liberty of creation, or of report, was confined to words,
and debarred from events and conduct, or that where speeches
are transparent fiction narrative is all hard fact.</p>
<p>(ii.) One matter of fact, into which fiction has certainly made
way, consists in the numbering of the forces of Xerxes. The
full results are, indeed, presented by Herodotus, not as bare facts
traditionally or authoritatively guaranteed, but in part at least as
products of argument and computation: the data are themselves
manifestly unsound, and the initial mistake naturally generates
a self-multiplying aberration.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 184-7; cp. Appendix II. § 5.</p></note> The final result is a miscalculation
rather than a fable, and attaints the author's judgement rather
than the character of his Sources. Yet there was plainly that
in his Sources to start him upon this road to ruin; and the
instance shows at once the licence of his Greek authorities, and
the inability of Herodotus to control or to amend it. One
hundred and seventy myriads of fighting men is the total which
Herodotus accepts at starting as the figure for the infantry of
Xerxes massed and numbered at Doriskos, with eighty thousand
added for the cavalry.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 60.</p></note> Such forces the Persian king might
conceivably have levied from his vast empire; but such forces he
could not have taken with him into Greece, nor supported had
he taken them thither. The figure is, however, only an estimate,
based upon an incredible anecdote, and not a total reached by
a summation of various items for the various component parts
of the army. Herodotus, indeed, is not content with the given
figures; but, far from seeking to diminish them, he is shortly
attempting to increase them, and succeeds, to his own satisfaction,
in raising the total of the king's forces by land to upwards of
two million fighting men. The numbers for the fleet are not
perhaps so extravagant, though a total of upwards of half a
million men at arms is a manifest exaggeration. Misjudgement
and absurdity reach a climax in the proposal to double the figures
throughout in order to make allowance for attendants and
followers, raising the total of the men led by Xerxes as far as
Thermopylai and the Thessalian shore to upwards of five millions
and a quarter. This passage is of the utmost importance for a
just estimate of Herodotus' competence as a military historian.
His figures and his computation set conditions of time and space


<pb n="lxxxii"/>
at defiance: the initial device, by which the total for the infantry
was obtained at Doriskos, is itself an absurdity. If other figures
for fleets and forces on both sides are more moderate and sane,
that cannot expunge the deliberate and express misjudgement
to which Herodotus is committed in this instance. The total of
the Persian fleet (raised by the European contingent to 1327
vessels) Herodotus reduces by storms and captures before
Salamis to about 600 vessels; but he supposes these losses to
have been fully compensated by the contingents of Karystos,
Andros, Tenos, and other Nesiotes: a manifest absurdity.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 8. 66.</p></note>
Such arithmetical irresponsibility, in the face of physical and
historical conditions, is not to be condoned by the observation
that the motives of exaggeration in both directions are transparent
enough. The defect of science here is a defect of art likewise,
and almost of common sense. <title>Ars est celare artem.</title> It may be
questioned whether any one has ever taken these figures and
computations for truth except Herodotus himself. The deliberate
effort to make the most of the hosts of Xerxes has drawn
attention to the physical conditions and the recorded facts of the
case, which alike disprove the historian's reckoning. There are
no two pages in the whole work of Herodotus more fatal to his
claims as a sober historian than the pages devoted to these
systematic and elaborate computations. Herodotus is dealing
seriously from first to last in this business; it is not an
exaggerated jest nor an ironical satire: that is the worst of it!
<title>Solvuntur risu tabulae!</title> The thing is ridiculous, and neither
‘the rivers that failed,’<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 187 <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste ou)de/n moi qw=ma pari/statai

e)/xein tou=to to\ kra/tos</foreign>.</p></note> invented apparently <foreign rend="ital">ad hoc,</foreign> can save Herodotus from
bankruptcy on this account.</p>
<p>(iii.) Naturally computation is not the only particular in
which Herodotus breaks down as an historian of military affairs.
Passing over here his description of the arms and accoutrements
of the vast host, his account of its march with the king at its
head leaves much to be desired, even on his own showing.
Despite its colossal size, the host remained, if we are to credit
Herodotus, a chaotic mob, until it reached Doriskos.<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 7. 59.</p></note> Again,




<pb n="lxxxiii"/>
though we may detect in his records evidence that the army was
organized in three corps or columns, and advanced in that order,
it is evidence of which he himself seems unconscious, and the
arrangement is only predicated by him of one short stage on the
route.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 121.</p></note> Again, although in one place he indicates that the
Persian strategy treated, so long as possible, fleet and army
as indissoluble,<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 236.</p></note> he shows practically no consciousness of this
clue in his own narrative of the two campaigns, but treats the
movements of the fleets and armies, on both sides, as wholly
independent, though accidentally synchronous, series of operations;
and while he has incidentally enabled us to relate the battles
of Thermopylai and Artemision to each other, he has left the
relations of the movements of the Greek fleet in 479 B.C. to the
operations on land, a matter of pure speculation. His accounts
of individual battles break up for the most part into successions
of disconnected episodes. His diary of the fighting in front of
Plataia must be pronounced on the whole his <foreign rend="ital">chef d'œuvre</foreign> in
this kind; yet it is replete with obscurities and improbabilities,
and indicates very little conception, on the writer's part, or that
of his informants, of the strategic and tactical conditions involved.
It may be that materials for an adequate and reasoned record of
the Persian war hardly existed in the time of Herodotus, or that,
for all his merits and goodwill, he was not just the right man to
collect and to digest them; but neither plea alters the actual
quality of the narrative in question. The best that can be said
of his military essays is that they preserve an outline of events,
which might otherwise have been wanting, and contain scattered
hints showing the actual war to have been conducted on intelligible
and intelligent principles. These hints justify the endless
attempts on the part of Herodotus' followers and commentators
to reconstruct with more or less success the probable plans of the
two belligerents, and the actual contour of the various operations
by sea and by land, in the course of the Persian war.</p>
<p>(iv.) Conditions and limitations, which precluded success in
the attempt to give a true history of the war, have not enabled
Herodotus to present an adequate or accurate version of the
policies of the states or statesmen whose acts and advices he had
to record. Policy is a less technical concern than strategy and


<pb n="lxxxiv"/>
tactics; yet states fare little better in the pages of Herodotus
than fleets and armies. It is hardly to be reckoned a serious
fault if he represents the policy of Persia as ultimately dependent
on a despot's caprice; yet his own pages teem with proofs of
the inevitable character of the Persian war.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. Appendix II. § 2.</p></note> Neither the action
nor the inaction of Sparta is traced to any clear motives, or
objects of policy, in these Books; and, as it happens, an important
development of Spartan policy in relation to Athens and
the Persian question is reported, in the sixth Book, in terms
which reduce the account to a mere anecdote; yet among all
Greek states the policy of Sparta is at all times the most easily
explained.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. Appendix III. § 3.</p></note> The conduct of Athens is throughout represented in
the heroic terms accepted from the Attic or philo-Athenian
sources<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 Cp. especially 7. 139, and Appendix
III. § 4.</p></note>; the material and political interests which Athens had
at stake, and in especial the definite object to resist a tyrannic
restoration under Persian auspices, is barely indicated, or but
unconsciously suggested. The policy of the Medizing states is,
perhaps, more successfully adumbrated than ‘the policy of those
who chose the better part’<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( ta\ a)mei/nw frone/ontes</foreign>, cp. 7. 145,

are <foreign rend="ital">verae causae,</foreign> most clearly expressed in the cases of Phokis and
of Argos. Over the political attitudes and sympathies of Makedon
and of Delphi a glamour had been thrown, we cannot but suspect,
in the light of later events and interests, which Herodotus has
accepted somewhat too credulously at its own valuation. Yet
on the whole the political motives of the various states named are
historical problems not difficult of solution in and from his records,
although the truth in regard to the political action of Delphi and
of Makedon in particular may never be quite clearly recovered.
It is in dealing with the behavious and motives of individuals that
his sympathies, or his sources, betray Herodotus into something
like superficial injustice. The attitude and action of Alexander








<pb n="lxxxv"/>
of Makedon have been reported probably from sources deeply
coloured by the political results of the Persian war. The record
of Themistokles does little justice to the political objects and
abilities, or even the patriotism, of that statesman, and Herodotus
has failed—has not attempted—to get behind the traditions and
anecdotes which dated from his fall, or were the outcome of the
hostilities that helped to fell him. The political action of Gelon
in relation to the Persian and national question has been obscured
in the Herodotean record by the general Hellenic antipathy to
‘tyrants,’ though fortunately in this case later and local knowledge
has led Herodotus to supplement the general tradition,
current in Athens or Sparta, with a special variant, which proves
at once good history and good politics, more than justifying the
non-appearance of Gelon at Salamis, justifying also the doubt
whether his co-operation was ever invited at all. The character
of Xerxes, as a politician, has been reduced, in the conflicting
tradition preserved by Herodotus, to that of a paradoxical puppet,
partly swayed by supernatural interventions and agencies driving
him on to his doom, partly led by evil councillors more astute
and ambitious than himself, partly the creature of his own
capricious and ungovernable passions. That there was no real
precedent for such a portrait it would be rash to affirm; but it
is safe to say that the particular motives assigned for many of
the King's undertakings and actions are unduly prejudiced, and
that where good reasons were forthcoming, Herodotus did ill so
often to prefer the worse reason for the conduct of Xerxes.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. 7. 24, 54; 8. 25, 103.</p></note></p>
<p>(v.) It is, in short, not unfair to say that Herodotus was
primarily neither a military nor a political historian, and does
not always show to advantage beside a Thucydides, a Polybios,
a Caesar, or even a Tacitus. Herodotus prefers the concrete to
the abstract, the particular to the universal, the anecdote, the
episode, the <foreign rend="ital">bon mot,</foreign> the <foreign rend="ital">gnome,</foreign> to the reasoned description of
military movements, or the conscious rationale of political events.
Even his record of the second Persian war, much the most closely
connected and best sustained achievement in his logography, teems
with sportive items.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 56, 120, 147, 194 (239); 8. 26,
118, 125, 137-8; 9. 33-5, 37, 76, 78-82,
93-4, 108-13, 122.</p></note> Such things are not history, though they
may be, if rightly authenticated, a part of the materials out of


<pb n="lxxxvi"/>
which history is to be made, or at least to be made agreeable.
In a sense, indeed, they are better than history, they are mostly
too good to be true; but in general they are at once either too
artful or too artless to rank as good historical evidences. In
the one case they betray the moral, and in the other case the
malignity, which has been at the making of them; or at best
they drop out of serious account as pure sports of the humorist,
or raconteur.</p>
<p>(vi.) Again, the record of the Persian war as told by Herodotus
suffers detriment, from the strictly historical point of view, by
the too ready admission of the marvellous, the miraculous, the
special intervention of ‘the other world,’ in one shape or another.
To justify Herodotus from this charge, in a certain sense, is easy
enough. Granted that Xerxes was not hounded on by divinely
ordered dreams and apparitions to carry out the pre-ordained
purpose of Heaven in the invasion of Greece<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 12, 14, 17, 19.</p></note>: granted that the
deliverance of Delphi was unaccompanied by special apparitions
and miracles<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 8. 35-9.</p></note>: waiving the reported interventions, omens, portents,
that cluster round Salamis and its story<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 7. 142; 8. 41, 54, 55, 65, 77, 84, 94, 96; 9. 10.</p></note>: rationalizing the
telepathic <title>Phemè</title> at Mykale, and its reputed synchronism with
the victory of Plataia<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 9. 90, 100-1.</p></note>: yet still, it may be said, Herodotus had
failed for all time to represent a notable and perfectly historical
feature in the traditions of the war, aye, in the souls of the
victors themselves, had he omitted to reproduce these irrational
elements in the story as it reached him from the age of faith.
These elements are features in the story, because such elements,
the same in kind if not in amount and prominence, were factors
in the life of Greece in the fifth century. Oracles, dreams,
portents, with their interpretation, counted for something, not
insignificant, in the actions of living men and women, and in the
policy of states, in a pre-metaphysical age. And what fault could
be found with Herodotus if he but reported the cases where the
oracle was appealed, and helped to determine action, or failed to
do so, as might be; if he but recorded marvels, or supposed
marvels, or any other ‘religious’ excuse, as actual motives of
action, and even of policy? The suspicion is unavoidable
that, strong as was the belief in the direct intervention of




<pb n="lxxxvii"/>
gods and heroes in human affairs, important as was the rôle
played by oracles, divination, the interpretation of portents,
dreams, and so forth, in real life, yet all these things nevertheless
played less part in men's actions and fortune than
the logography of Herodotus would lead us to suppose. The
charge is rather that, owing to an idiosyncrasy, a personal
penchant for such things, he has given them an undue prominence
in his narrative to the exclusion of more genuinely historical
elements; he has preferred a ‘supranaturalistic’ story, or version
of a story, to a more natural one; he has transfused his whole
conception and representation of the course of affairs so as to
bring it into agreement with a somewhat thin and antiquated
view of the action of the ‘God in History’; and, both in what
he inserts and in what he omits, in the form he has given to his
materials, or the forms he has accepted and preferred, the bold
miracle has too often taken the place of the better reason.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 See especially 7. 133-137; 8. 13, 77; 9. 65.</p></note> It
may be some compensation to us that by this very miscarriage
and shortcoming Herodotus all the more fully represents the
popular mind of his age and people, and so becomes, in a fresh
application, historical in our eyes; but this consolation is tantamount
to admitting that, in the first instance, he presents to
us an imperfectly historical mind, and represents an imperfectly
historical age, or rather the less instructed side of an age, which
was already in all its leading minds essentially scientific.</p>
<p>(vii.) Of the worst charge against the good faith of an
historian Herodotus stands acquitted: personal bias, personal
ill-will, should never have been alleged against him. As
formulated in the pages of Plutarch's tract <foreign rend="ital">de Malignitate Herodoti</foreign>
this charge, a monument of critical incompetence, collapses upon
the Boiotian critic's own pate. A good deal of malignity is,
indeed, preserved in the pages of Herodotus, but it is there as
evidence, for the most part, of the surpassing candour and
simplicity of the writer's own mind. Kretans were not the
only liars in Greece: Greeks all told stories at each other's
expense, Athens to the discredit of Sparta, of Korinth, of Thebes,
each of which doubtless returned the compliment with interest:
oligarch maligned democrat, and democrat maligned oligarch, and
both united to blacken the tyrant's fame: feuds of clan with clan.

<pb n="lxxxviii"/>
and rivalries of man with man, gave constant vogue to the worse
report and the worse interpretation of each other's actions. It was
a part of the price paid by the Greeks for their enfranchisement.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 237 <foreign xml:lang="greek">polih/ths me\n polih/th| eu)=
p rh/ssonti fqone/ei</foreign>.</p></note>
All this carnival of calumny is reflected in the pages of Herodotus,
thanks to his direct reproduction of the local version, the partisan
story, the rival's anecdote, the apologist's retort. But there is
little or no malice in his own private judgements, nor is a malign
spirit consistent with the general tone of his work. That
Herodotus betrays no political or personal preferences it would
be too much to assert: such a miracle of impartiality would be
more or less than man and than Herodotus; but he errs by
excess rather than by defect of admiration. His two worst
offences in this connexion are to have taken too easily the
current Athenian transfiguration of Athens, and the current
Athenian denigrations of Themistokles. For the rest, Herodotus
preserves somewhat more than a benevolent neutrality. Who
can say that he does less than justice to Lakedaimon, if he
reproduces too faithfully one Athenian jibe at Sparta's honour?<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 9. 54 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pista/menoi ta\ *lakedaimoni/wn
fronh/mata w(s a)/lla froneo/ntwn kai\ a)/lla
lego/ntwn</foreign>.</p></note>
Or to Korinth, if he reports the Athenian scandal, with the
universally received <foreign rend="ital">démenti</foreign> in immediate juxtaposition?<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 8. 94.</p></note> Or to
Argos, for whose conduct he apologizes with, perhaps, half an
eye to “the Attic question”?<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 7. 148-52.</p></note> Or to Thebes, whose medism was
past whitewashing, even though the account of the Thebans at
Thermopylai is one of the weakest spots in the historian's armour?<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 7. 233.</p></note>
Yet there is little or nothing in all this, and in the lesser cases
which might be cited, to convict Herodotus in his own person
of ill-will to any man or state in Hellas.<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 See especially 7. 152</p></note> That he does no
injustice to the Barbarian has often enough been pointed out<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 9. 62 is notable, but Hdt.'s whole
treatment of non-Hellenic peoples is to
his credit.</p></note>:
that not even Plutarch's captious tract alleged against him.</p>
<p>(viii.) Herodotus' own reflexions are seldom profound, and
never ill-natured.<note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 There are about fifty expressions of
personal opinion in these Bks. (often
signalized by <foreign xml:lang="greek">doke/ein, w(s ei)ka/sai</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">et sim.</foreign>).
Among them may be specified (1), (2),
importance of the services of Athens,
7. 139, 8. 63; (3) a candid remark on
Medizers, 8. 73; (4) need for reticence
in theology, 9. 65; (5) connexion of
conduct and character, 7. 153; (6) his
opinion of Themistokles, 8. 22, etc.; (7)
of Aristeides, 8. 79; (8) of Aristodemos,
9. 71. But, after all, every page displays
the mind of Hdt., cp. pp. lxxxv f. <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></note> His very empiricism refutes the charge of








<pb n="lxxxix"/>
ill-will.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 152 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)gw\ de\ o)fei/lw le/gein ta\

pa/nta lo/gon</foreign>.</p></note> His method of letting people tell their own story,
instead of rationalizing or reducing all his conflicting materials to
a self-consistent <foreign rend="ital">précis,</foreign> enables his readers to compare one account
with another for themselves, and to correct at times the version
preferred by the historian in the light of one reported on principle.
Not indeed that Herodotus quite fulfils his own formula. He
has not been at sufficient pains always to collect information from
every source legitimately concerned. It is certainly strange, and
a little unfortunate, that the campaign of Plataia should be so
largely drawn from Athenian tradition, and throughout Herodotus
is too much at the mercy of his Athenian authorities. Yet even
here the very transparency of the medium supplies its own corrective,
and the absence of conscious or deliberate special pleading
on the historian's part enables his readers to improve on his
position. This observation holds good even of the stories of the
nautical and military operations: we may venture to rationalize
them just because the historian has done little or nothing himself
in that direction. If, on the whole or in parts, we claim to
understand the course of events better than our best authority, it
is not so much that we correct and supplement his record largely
from other sources, but rather that his record so largely supplies
its own corrective, in the conflict of evidences reported, and the
manifest animus of much reproduced bona fide by the reporter.
Such reconstruction can be but hypothetical, and of course depends
for its acceptance upon appeal to still verifiable facts in
the physical conditions, and in the nature of man; but it is
not thereby discredited as illegitimate, and its verisimilitude is
due, in the last resort, to the simple good faith of the first report.</p>
<p>(ix.) The naïveté of Herodotus must not, however, be exaggerated;
the presence of a critical and a rationalistic tendency
in his work cannot be denied. He has himself exercised to
some extent a judgement, if not in the selection, at least in the
evaluation of his sources, rejecting stories as untrue, or improbable,
which he still thinks it his duty to report, entering his own
opinion and verdict in some disputed cases formally for what it
is worth, and incidentally or implicitly forcing on his audience

<pb n="xc"/>
a certain reading of the facts, a certain rationale of the merely
empirical order of phenomena, or the merely empirical roll of
witnesses. In some cases this element of reflexion, when
segregated and envisaged on its own merits, leaves very little to
be desired. No one will claim for Herodotus the rank of a
philosophic thinker; yet the rationale which he gives, in one way
or another, sometimes speaking in his own person, sometimes by
the lips of his <foreign rend="ital">dramatis personae,</foreign> sometimes it may be in the mere
way of narrative, of the Greek victory over the Persians, is all but
complete. On the Persian side the unmanageable size and
numbers of the hosts<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 Cp. 7. 49; 8. 16.</p></note>; disregard of sound policy and errors in
the actual plans of campaign<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 7. 235; 9. 2.</p></note>; division of interests, rivalry
and quarrels among the leaders, and in the command<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 7. 10; 8. 26, 69; 9. 41, 58, 66, 107.</p></note>; division
of interests and lack of coherence in the fighting forces<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 8. 10, 19, 22, 68, 90.</p></note>; positive
inferiority in equipment, armour, skill, discipline, training<note anchored="true" n="5"><p>5 7. 211; 8. 86; 9. 62-3.</p></note>: what
more could be required to explain the issue? On the Greek
side the contrary and the complement of all these: the advantage
in actual material and military equipment<note anchored="true" n="6"><p>6 7. 211, 223; 8. 86; 9. 62.</p></note>; the advantage in
skill, in discipline, in leadership, in intelligence; union<note anchored="true" n="7"><p>7 8. 144; 9. 2.</p></note>; the
advantage in manhood and in <foreign rend="ital">moral</foreign><note anchored="true" n="8"><p>8 7. 102, 104, 220; 8. 83; 9. 76, 78-9,
82.</p></note>; the vast superiority of the
cause.<note anchored="true" n="9"><p>9 7. 11; 8. 109; 9. 108-113.</p></note> Yet Herodotus does not escape a certain inconsequence
between his clear perception of the secondary causes accountable
for the Greek victory, and his strong, desire to make the most of
the danger, and to magnify the result, as a great and wonderful
work, not to be explained by any merely human actions or
considerations. In the end he is not content, short of the
invocation of his highest categories for human experience. In
his mind the victory is due, immediately and ultimately, to the
direct interposition of the gods and heroes, the higher individual
wills which rule the world, and to the supreme laws of all human
life and fortune.<note anchored="true" n="10"><p>10 7. 139 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=toi h)=san oi( <gap/> basile/a

the salvation of Greece, are ascribed to the jealousy excited in
the god, Zeus, by the pride and power of the man, Xerxes<note anchored="true" n="11"><p>11 7. 10; 8. 109.</p></note>; or











<pb n="xci"/>
ethically expressed, to the sure nemesis which lies in wait for the
high and mighty things of this world, to the certain if slow
corruption which is the lot of mortality, to the law that happiness
is not for man, and human life at best a sorrowful thing.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 7. 46; 9. 16.</p></note>
Doubtless this moral has led Herodotus to portray in Xerxes
the character which deserves the judgement, to emphasize in the
traditions those traits and anecdotes which accord with the
foregone conclusion; but even here his method, careless of
inconsistencies, has redeemed his work; showing that the
historic Xerxes was not the mere despot, proud and capricious,
cruel and cowardly, vicious and well-nigh insane, as too much of
the record implies, but that his actions were guided at least in
some degree by the intelligible motives of a politician, and the
reasonable feelings of a man.</p>
<p>Nor can it be said that Herodotus' empirical method of narrating
stories, or his meternpirical doctrines of Divine vengeance
and of mortal doom, have much diminished his political sagacity
and fairness, where there is a call for their application. His view
of the service of Athens, and of the importance of that service to
the cause of Greece, though insufficiently qualified by any clear
statement of the great interests Athens had at stake, is nevertheless
on its positive side a judgement in which the modern world must
acquiesce. His perception of the separatist feelings underlying
the action and policy of the Peloponnesian states is clear enough.
His problematical interpretation of the conduct of Sparta at a
critical moment is ambiguous only in form<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 9. 8.</p></note>; and his explanation
of the final determination to co-operate loyally with Athens is
none the less his own for being put into dramatic form.<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 9. 9.</p></note>
Throughout, Herodotus must have credit for reporting with
understanding the political wisdom and sagacity of his heroes
or <foreign rend="ital">dramatis personae,</foreign> even where he is not actually fathering on
them his own reflexions; and the application of this principle
proves that, although his express judgements on political affairs
appear at times strangely superficial, yet this current superficiality
is consistent with a high degree of political shrewdness upon
occasion. Even his anecdotes, though doubtless often apocryphal,
may be regarded as the deliberately chosen vehicles for a good
deal of sound sense, and political or ethical philosophy. Such



<pb n="xcii"/>
parables as the ‘Crown of Virtue,’<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 8. 26.</p></note> the ‘Dinner <foreign rend="ital">à la Perse,</foreign>’<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 9. 82.</p></note> the
‘Answer of Kyros,’<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 9. 122.</p></note> have each as clear a moral as the fable of
‘Persuasion and Necessity’<note anchored="true" n="4"><p>4 8. 111.</p></note> put into the mouth of Themistokles
to adorn a solemn historic occasion. The reflective element in
Herodotus' work is far larger than appears at first sight, owing
to the skilful means which he has adopted to render it more
easily digestible. It is the very dotage of criticism to suppose
that Herodotus is unconscious of his own devices, or incapable of
the wit and wisdom which he has made his own; he himself
must be credited with most of the reflexion which we find in his
pages, whether it take the form of express judgements delivered
<foreign rend="ital">ex cathedra</foreign> by the historian himself, or be conveyed dramatically
by speakers in the course of his narrative, or wear the still more
lively and insidious guise of an anecdote <foreign rend="ital">en passant,</foreign> or a <foreign rend="ital">bon mot,</foreign>
recorded for what it is worth. It is perhaps not too much to say
of these elements in the last three Books that they bear more
directly on the general theme, and cohere more closely with the
proper texture of the story, than do similar elements in other
sections of the work; and this observation also tends to the
general credit of this volume of <title>Logoi,</title> whether regarded as a
permanent contribution to history, in the strictest sense of the
term, or merely as a literary achievement calculated to give
pleasure to readers, or listeners, in moments of leisure.</p>
<p>(x.) The geographical deposit is another element in which
the last three Books of Herodotus approach more nearly to the
standards of sound historiography than any other considerable
section of the work. The comparative fulness and accuracy of the
geography is partly incidental to the subject, like the advantage
which the narrative of Thucydides gains from being concerned
with relatively well-known landscapes, and scenes amenable
to methods of simple inspection. Not that Herodotus even in
these Books is a scientific geographer, or free from empirical
errors; but, defects and errors notwithstanding, the contribution
which he makes incidentally to the cartography of the Aigaian
area, of ancient Greece, of parts of Asia, especially minor Asia, is
not inconsiderable—a positive contribution, as matters stand for
us, quite independent of the question, how far the geographical
data in his work are the result of his own researches, and how




<pb n="xciii"/>
far the geography has come to him ready-made by his predecessors,
or involved in the narrative, as found in his Sources.<note anchored="true" n="1"><p>1 For the geography and topography
see Appendices II. § 3, IV. §§ 3-6, V.
§ 1, VI. § 2, VIII. § 2, the Commentary
<foreign rend="ital">passim,</foreign> and Indices III. and IV.</p></note></p>
<p>(xi.) The chronology of the war deserves appreciation on
similar lines: scientific, or even approximately systematic, it is
not; yet nowhere in the work of Herodotus is the chronology so
good as in the last three Books. Here too the advantage is
inherent in the subject, the story of a short and recent war of
invasion: but what of that? The admission but emphasizes the
historical quality of the record. The exact period of the war, the
succession of the seasons, the temporal sequence of events, some
well-remembered intervals, some approximate synchronisms, even
the <title>Ephemerides</title> or diaries of important sections of the story, are
presented for all time in the pages of Herodotus. Many weighty
and interesting problems of chronology are indeed left doubtful;
some apparently precise indications prove, on closer scrutiny,
ambiguous; but still the narrative as a whole emerges, relatively
speaking, a chronological triumph for the Father of History. His
great disciple, and rival, Thucydides, seems to have done little
new in this matter except to systematize and apply to a more
extensive and amenable subject the method evolved by Herodotus
in the stories of the Persian war.<note anchored="true" n="2"><p>2 Cp. Appendix IX., and Index IV.
<foreign rend="ital">sub vv.</foreign> Chronology, Dates.</p></note></p>
<p>(xii.) Finally, the last three Books of Herodotus are not
lacking in materials for students of Comparative Jurisprudence,
of Ancient Law and Early Institutions, of Folk-lore, even if the
deposit under this head be less rich than in the Books of foreign
travel and research, notably the second and the fourth. A
careful analysis of the <title>Logoi</title> here in question will soon discover
a very considerable contribution to the institutional history
not merely of the Greeks,<note anchored="true" n="3"><p>3 Such institutions as the following

through the Army and Navy Lists of the Empire; systems of
military tactics and command are seen on both sides in operation;
forms of government, monarchy, oligarchy, democracy, are put
to the test; principles and practices of international custom
are formulated, or illustrated; religious cults and ideas start
from every page; ethical standards and sentiments abound in
evidence; the condition of the arts and sciences is exhibited;
the story of the war becomes a survey of mankind. All these
items of anthropology are, indeed, no more immune to criticism
than the express contributions of military and political history;
but they gain in credit and in use by the very fact that their
publication was not the main purpose of the argument. The
incidental fact, which occurs so to speak in an alien stratum,
is historically all the more acceptable for being unnecessary to
the object immediately in view.</p></div>
<div type="section" n="12">
<head>The false and the true estimates of Herodotus and his work</head>
<p>In conclusion, there are two types, or tendencies, in
the recent criticism of Herodotus and his work, which may here
be expressly disavowed. They are alike inelastic and onesided;
perfunctory and wanting in historical imagination; critical,
yet not half critical enough. While appearing to assign to the
work of Herodotus a higher place than can be claimed for it by
a more discriminative analysis, in reality they alike depreciate
the combination of art and learning exhibited in the work. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>)
On the one hand we see the revival of an apology for Herodotus,
which finds little if anything to censure in his work from the
historical point of view, and argues the case for the defence, as



<pb n="xcv"/>
though under the circumstances, or under any circumstances, the
work of ‘the historian of the Medic wars’ could have been done
no better. This apology involves too great a self-sacrifice to be
acceptable. We are to admit the numbering of the Persian
host at Doriskos, and its results, as historical; we must exclude
appeal to the permanent and verifiable conditions of strategy and
tactics, and allow much for possible in antiquity which would be
impossible to-day; we shall confess that fact is none the less
fact though contaminated with fiction, and that a half-truth is as
true as a whole. Such attempts to reduce to insignificance the
exaggerations, the inconsistencies, the absurdities, the impossibilities
in the Herodotean record, and to exalt the work as a whole into
a world-history, or even a history of the Medic wars, can only
depreciate its unconscious values as a mirror of the age and of
the conditions under which it was produced, without procuring
any credit to the actual story of the war, to the glimpses of
policy, and the items of biography involved. To reconstruct, so
far as possible, the true history of the Medic wars, it is not
necessary to ignore the shortcomings of our chief authority, or to
suppose that his reputation can be ‘rescued’ by displaying the
inconsistencies, or vagaries, of modern criticism: the pathetic
apotheosis of Herodotus, as an historical authority, avenges itself
doubly, in the inadequacy of the historical result, in the inconsistency
of the literary critique. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) On the other hand the advice to
abandon all attempts at separating fact and fiction in the work of
Herodotus, to treat it all as pure literature, to sandwich it in our
libraries between the Homeric poems and the Waverley novels,
is a mere counsel of indolence, or of despair. Even the earlier
Books of Herodotus, not excepting the portions of them which
deal with non-Hellenic affairs, deserve more respect than is
implied in such an advice; while the Books, or the <title>Logoi,</title> dealing
with things Hellenic, acclaim an indefinitely higher though
critically varying appreciation in the Forum of History. The
last three Books in especial, despite the elements of poetry,
rhetoric, anecdote, moralizing, error, and sheer ignorance which
they contain, will reward a searching examination at the bar of
historical criticism. Only, one may not hope to pass a single
and simple verdict upon each and every constituent in the
story; one must be at some trouble to distinguish <title>Logos</title> from
<title>Logos</title> and line from line in every Book; one must be pre<pb n="xcvi"/>
pared to find wares of widely different values side by side
in the Herodotean bazaar. The contribution which Herodotus
makes to the actual history of his own times, of the
<title>Pentekontaëteris,</title> is not inconsiderable, and ranks with the best
materials of a Thucydides, a Xenophon, a Polybios: the only
pity is, there does not happen to be more of it. The records of
the Medic war, in its two campaigns, its operations by sea and
on land, its inception and antecedents, its character and course,
are indeed inadequate and to some extent irrational: nevertheless,
there is undoubtedly presented by the story a correct sequence of
the major events, a not wholly misleading account of the relations
between states, a fair outline of their respective policies and
conduct, and many hints towards an estimate of the services
rendered by the principals on both sides. This volume too, like
the others, is a treasury of information upon a host of topics not
directly connected with the bare story of the war, and sheds
side-lights, in floods, upon the Hellenic and non-Hellenic worlds
of the day. Ignorance and prejudice have deeply marred and
stained the traditions, and authorities, upon which Herodotus,
the rather as not strictly contemporary with his proper subject,
had to rely; and, though by no means helplessly at the mercy
of the first comer, he had not the necessary degree of critical
faculty to sift grain from chaff, and wheat from tares, in his
harvest of hearsay; yet still, for all that, the story of the war
stands for ever in his pages on its merits an indispensable chapter
of Hellenic and of human history, to be the delight and vexation
of men and critics from generation to generation. If there is
still so little agreement, even in regard to the negative criticism
of the records, it is perhaps due to the failure of our scholars at
starting sufficiently to discriminate the various elements of the
problem, sufficiently to analyse the component factors in the
general result, so as to evolve the widely different values, which
belong to different statements, occurring side by side in the
historian's pages, and all by him presented <foreign rend="ital">bona fide</foreign> as equally
trustworthy.</p>
<p>In fine, Herodotus was neither a mere story-telling prosepoet,
nor a scientific historian, but a genial minister to both
history and literature alike. The marvel is that, seeing how
brilliant a raconteur he is, there should be so much history in his
work; or that, where there is so much history, the work should
<pb n="xcvii"/>
read so well. The final test of its utility is to consider the
loss, not merely to literature but to learning, had the work of
Herodotus perished, or never been written. Confining our
attention here to the Persian war, what should we glean of
it without him? An <foreign rend="ital">aperçu</foreign> from Aischylos, some epigrams by
Simonides, a few references in the later literature, the gross
errors of Ktesias, the rhetorical and systematic fiction of Ephoros
(<foreign rend="ital">apud</foreign> Diodorum), itself the child of a crude exploitation of
Herodotus, a handful of vignettes from Plutarch, a list of monuments
in Pausanias. For the full and real story Herodotus holds
the field. There is, indeed, no ancient historian, whether upon
his own ground or on general grounds, with whom Herodotus need
fear comparison. He was more comprehensive than Thucydides;
he was more candid than Xenophon; he was more brilliant
than Polybios. As a military, or even as a political historian,
he must yield the palm to the rivals named; but, in the larger
view of history, which embraces every experience of humanity,
treats no aspect of human life as common or unclean,
regards man, under all conditions, and in all times and places,
his fortunes and misfortunes, his adventures and achievements,
as the most interesting topic in the world, and the portrayal
and literary perpetuation of all that as the work best worth
doing under the sun, Herodotus keeps his rank as the premier
historian of antiquity: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)ia/dos a)rxai/hs i(stori/hs pru/tanis</foreign>.</p>

of the eleventh, while R is a Roman (Vatican) of the fourteenth century, V a
Viennese codex, and S the Sancroft MS., both of obviously inferior value,
but belonging to the same family. An earlier Florentine MS. (C) agrees
generally with the elder family. Other codd. to which express reference is
occasionally made (chiefly after Stein<hi rend="sup">1</hi> 's apparatus) are one or other of two
Paris MSS., viz. 1633, cited as P (an early MS. more akin to <hi rend="bold"><foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign></hi>)<hi rend="bold">,</hi> and Paris.

<foreign rend="ital">editio princeps</foreign> is cited as z. Various emendations are certified by their
authors' names. The Ionic of Herodotus remains a great difficulty in the way
of constituting a definitive text: neither family of MSS. appears to offer a
perfectly consistent dialectal norm, as variations noted in the <title>Apparatus</title> will
show; fixed rules hardly obtain in regard to such matters as elision (<foreign xml:lang="greek">de/, d'</foreign>),

fu&lt;*&gt;r Papyrusforschung</title> i. 471-3;  <title>Amherst Pap.</title> ii. 12 <foreign rend="ital">teste</foreign> B. P. Grenfell).
MSS. of the Roman period might be expected to show some dialectal freaks,
and also, perhaps, <title>Atticizing</title> tendencies; but Herodotus himself, in cases
where his materials were largely drawn from Attic sources, as in Bk. 9, may
have led the way in that direction. The <title>Index Lectionum</title> contains references
only to such passages in the text as are noticed in the Commentary.</p>
<p>The text is on the whole satisfactory to the mere historian: cases in
which any point of material or historical importance turns upon the reading,
are comparatively few in number. In the last three Books, apart from
many lacunae, glosses, and doubtful proper names, the following passages
afford textual problems of special interest, from the realist point of view:—

little left him to do, at least symbolically,
to manifest his wiath, if the story of
the Bow-shot, the Prayer, and the Mentor,
connected in tradition with the news of
the sack of Sardes in 498 B.C. (Hdt.
5. 105), is to be believed. That story
could not well have been connected with
the news of Marathon for two reasons:
(1) it treated the Athenians as an unknown
quantity to Dareios; (2) Marathon
was not, except in the eyes of the
Athenians, so very great or significant
an achievement (cp. Appendix X. to
my edition of Bks. IV.-VI.: 1895).
Still, the omission of any specific action
to set forth the wrath of Dareios upon
this occasion leaves the Herodotean
phrase vague and unsatisfactory. This
defect, however, does not justify the
substitution of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)poie/eto</foreign> for the active
form of the verb. It appears, however,
plainly in the sequel that Dareios (according
to Hdt.) intended to conduct
the reinvasion of Hellas in person (cp.

was a standard levy for the militia (of
which nothing is said in 3. 89 ff.). The
reading is in doubt; perhaps it is best to
omit <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xein</foreign> altogether (with van H.).
Even if we read <foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xein</foreign> (with Stein)
we need not adopt Stein's interpretation,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pare/xein</foreign> being epexegetical merely.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign> may cover not only the Marathonian

the variant in Justin and Plutarch that
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sta)sis</foreign> took place after the death of
Dareios; but the versions are not mutually
exclusive. Hdt., however, in the
anecdote which follows has not perhaps
very clearly distinguished two different
cases—(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the appointment of a viceroy,
for the king's absence; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the appointment
of a successor, in case of the king's
death. In Hdt. 1. 208 Kyros appoints
Kambyses, his son, <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| per th\n basilhi/hn</foreign>
<pb n="3"/>
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)di/dou</foreign>, as viceroy before going against
the Massagetai; Kambyses, before going
to Egypt, appointed a Magos as <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n

—but the Magos was not to succeed in
the event of the king's death. No
similar provision is recorded in the case
of the Scythian expedition of Dareios
himself (Bk. 4), but Xerxes in 480 B.C.
evidently appoints his uncle Artabanos
as Major-domo and Viceroy, c. 52 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>
Artaxerxes Mnemon appointed a successor
(Dareios) simply in view of his own age,
and to avoid a <foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> (Plutarch, <title>Artax.</title>
26). Rawliuson compares the case of
the succession of Kroisos, Hdt. 1. 92,
which would perhaps carry the custom
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">no)mos</foreign>) beyond the Persian limit. It
may fairly be doubted whether there
was any specifically Persian rule in the
matter; similar cases might arise in any
monarchy. The Spartan rule that there
should always be at least one king at
home stood on a different footing, and
was, if we may trust Hdt. 5. 75, devised
for the purpose of avoiding a kingly
<foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> on the campaign; it was not,
however, rigidly observed, cp. Xenophon,
<title>Hell.</title> 5. 3. 10, but the Spartan suggestion
in the context here is nevertheless
noticeable.</p></div>

truth, had Gobryas been mentioned before?
This text confirms the view that
Bk. 7 is earlier in composition than the
text of Bk. 3. Strange to say, there is
nothing about this marriage in Bk. 3,
not even in c. 88, where Dareios' wives
are enumerated: a striking illustration
of the independence of various passages
in the work of Hdt. even when dealing
with the same subject. Here only two
wives appear, (1) the daughter of Gobryas,
and (2) Atossa, the daughter of Kyros.
But Dareios had at least three otherwives:
(3) Artystone, daughter of Kyros, c. 69
<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>; (4) Parmys, daughter of Bardiya,
c. 78 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>; (5) Phaidyme, a daughter

The story of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> apparently comes
from a Spartan or quasi-Spartan source
(cp. Introduction, § 10), and at Sparta
the succession of the eldest was no doubt
the rule; cp. Hdt. 5. 39, 42.</p></div>

date is correct is another question; but
Ktesias 23 is not to be followed as
against Hdt. The flight of Demaratos
fell apparently 491 B C., some time after
his deposition (here mentioned as equivalent).
The absence of any reference
to the story told in Bk. 6, and the use
of the patronymic, are significant for
the problem of composition: the latter
indeed doubly significant, as Hdt. here
specifies his paternity without a hint
of suspicion. Otherwise the reference is
not especially favourable to Demaratos;
Hdt. gives it as his own opinion that the
Spartan exile had not much in reality
to say to the accession of Xerxes. On

This <foreign xml:lang="greek">no/mos</foreign> goes far beyond the mere law
of primogeniture above noticed; Hdt.
seems to have some misgiving about it.
The supposed law looks rather like an
inference from the case of Euryanax, 9. 10
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Leonidas succeeded his brother,
Kleomenes, and was succeeded by his
son Pleistarchos (in 480 B.C.), although
there was a son of Dorieus in Sparta at
the time, the said Euryanax, who may
have been excluded from the succession
on the ground that Dorieus, his father,
and elder brother to Leonidas, had never
actnally been king at all. The accession
of a cadet branch does not well accord
with the supposed rule (cp. case of
Leotychidas, 6. 65). Maspero, iii. 655

Ktesias gives Dareios only thirty-one
years (“with his usual incorrectness,”
Rawlinson) and makes his age seventytwo;
Blakesley calculates Dareios' age
as sixty-four on the Herodotean data.
Stein tries to reconcile the figures thirtysix
and thirty-one by remarking that
Dareios was only established as king in
516 B C But (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) this date is too late (cp.
Bks. IV.-VI., vol. ii. p. 37 n.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>); (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) neither

(further evidence of the
independence and prior composition of
Bk. 7; cp. Introduction, § 7). The connexion
of Mardonios with the royal
house is not quite fully expounded here.
Dareios had married a daughter of
Gobryas, i.e. a sister, or perhaps a halfsister
to Mardonios (her son disputes the
succession with Xerxes, c. 2 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); and
Mardonios had to wife a daughter of
Dareios, perhaps a full sister to Xerxes;
Mardonios was thus nephew, brother-inlaw,
and son-in-law to Dareios, and also
cousin and brother-in-law to Xerxes, but
considerably the king's senior. Mardonios
now appears as the evil genius
of the king (cp. <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 753">Aischyl. <title>Pers.</title> 753-8</bibl>
on the evil counsellors). As Blakesley
points out, Mardonios and Artaphrenes
represented different plans: the policy
of Artaphrenes had failed at Marathon;
Mardonios and the Thrac&imacr;an or overland
route come again to the front.
There was also ‘the previous question,’

Onomakritos may, perhaps, be connected
with the spread of ‘the Orphic religion’;
cp. Bury, <title>Hist. of Greece,</title> i. (1902) 339.
Lasos was “a lyric and dithyrambic

can Hdt. have had that, even before the
reconquest of Egypt, Xerxes was resolved
on the ultimate invasion of Hellas? Or,
conversely, that this resolution was subsequently
abandoned? At any rate, the
effect of the statement is to reduce the
reconquest of Egypt to a mere episode,
and to exalt the reinvasion of Hellas
into the main object of Persian policy,
and that rightly enough. Dramatically,
psychologically, and for the sake of the
great historic argument, the decision
ascribed to Xerxes is acceptable.</p></div>

of Egypt might have taken place within
twelve months of the death of Dareios;
otherwise, of course, the anniversary of
the death occurs before the invasion.
Curiously little is here made of this
rebellion in Egypt and its reduction:
was it a trifling affair? It appears from
Egyptian sources that Egypt enjoyed a
native (or Libyan) king, Chabbasch by
name, a votary of the Memphite god,
Ptah. The death of an Apis is recorded
for the <foreign rend="ital">second</foreign> year of his reign. The
temples in Buto were enriched by grants
of land. Some measures were taken to
protect the mouths and marshes of the
Nile from the Asiatic fleet. (Cp. Wiedemann,
<title>Aeg. Gesch.</title> ii. 685; Noldeke,
<title>Aufsätze,</title> 41.) But all this leaves no
impression upon the traditions in Hdt.,
whether here or elsewhere (not even in
Bk. 2). The middle verbs <foreign xml:lang="greek">poie/etai,

did not in person visit Egypt.</p></div>

His subsequent death, at the hands of
Inaros the Libyan, has been previously
related by Hdt. 3. 12—unless indeed
this passage was the earlier composed,
a view supported by the complete absence

On the celebrated ‘Dareios’ vase there
are six councillors; the figure behind
the throne is plainly not one of the
council, but a guard (cp. Baumeister,

The heads of the six great Houses may
have formed an inner ring (cp. 3. 84,
118), but there was a wider Privy
Council, as here implied, and the status
and title of councillor was probably
distinctly recognized (cp. Book of Daniel,
3. 24 <foreign rend="ital">et al.</foreign>), though the king might
presumably summon whom he would,
and on a campaign the councils of war
would naturally be composed of military
officers. For other parallel cases cp. 1.

c. 125 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pepeire/ato</foreign>). Mardonios,
as one of the <foreign rend="ital">dramatis personae,</foreign> of course
could not expressly refer to the story of
his expedition as told Hdt. 6. 43-45,
but he certainly presents a view of the
event amounting to a flat contradiction.
This result might be put down to the
historian's humour; but it is more
natural to see in it further evidence of
the priority and independence of Bk. 7.
Mardonios' account of his own exploit
is, indeed, uot so far removed from the
truth; but had the adventure been the
miserable fiasco described in Bk. 6, there
would have been a difficulty, or absurdity,
in the reference to it here. The statemeut
(<foreign rend="ital">bis</foreign>) of the failure of the Greeks
to oppose his passage conveys a criticism
implicitly ou Hellenic policy (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.69.5">Thuc.
1. 69. 5</bibl>); but the criticism is (as Stein
remarks) entirely beside the point, and
undramatic. Mardonios is, in fact, merely
the mouthpiece of Herodotus, who wishes
to give his natiou a lesson. Stein suggests
a direct reference to the circumstances
of the Peloponnesian war; but
the description of Greek warfare in this
passage (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pea\n ga\r — e)cw/lees ga\r dh\
gi/nontai</foreign>) suits the antecedeuts and circumstances
of the ten years' war (431-421
B.C.) extremely ill, and moreover
this passage belongs (I take it) to the
earlier composition of Hdt. There is no
apparent reference to the destruction of
Plataea. The wars here referied to are
such as those between Argos and Sparta,
Athens and Megara, Sybaris and Croton,
and so forth. Hdt. may have had in
view also the war between Eretria and
Chalkis, which was falsely regarded by
the Greek tradition iu the fourth century
as having been waged <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ tou= *lhla/ntou
pedi/ou</foreign> (Strabo, 465, cp. 448). A wellknown
passage of Polybios puts a more
generous construction upon the archaic

of honour and a desire for a final decision:

the discovery of the Behistun inscription

with the genealogy of Dareios
as there given (Achaimenes, Teispes,
Ariaramnes, Arsames, Hystaspes, cp. 1.
209), but is con&lt;*&gt;aminated with two or
three names (Kyros, Kambyses, Teispes),
two of which could not belong to direct
progenitors of Xerxes, exeept in so far as
he was the son of Atossa, the daughter of
Kyros the Great, here apparently described
as ‘Kyros son of Kambyses,’ as iu 1.
111, where Kyros appears as the son of
Kambyses, and grandson of another
Kyros. Nowhere in Hdt. (except 7. 11)
does Teispes appear in the Kyreian
pedigree, but in 3. 75 the line is referred
to Achaimenes (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rca/menos de\ a)p' *)axaime/neos

Since the discovery of the Babylonian
cylinder of Kyros now iu the British
Mnseum (cp. O. E. Hagen, <title>Keilschrifturkunden
zur Gesch. d. Konigs Cyrus,</title> 1891),
it has become evident that Hdt. has,
all places taken together, the official
pedigree of Kyros as son of Kambyses,
son of Kyros, son of Teispes, son of
Aehaimenes (though oddly enough this
last name is omitted on the Babylonian
record). The interpretation of the
present passage has now become obvious;
the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= *ku/rou</foreign> have probably
dropped out after <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kambu/sew</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\</foreign>
after the first <foreign xml:lang="greek">*tei+/speos</foreign>, and Xerxes is represented

with omission of his mother's

(1) Without the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s e/xqrhs</foreign> this
sentence would have given a good sense:
‘between the two alternatives, just specified,
there is no mean’; i.e. there is no
third alternative. Perhaps this meaning
might be substantially retained by taking
<foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s e)/xqrhs</foreign> as (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) causal, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) predicative
(‘that there is no alternative is due to

apparently takes <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ me/son th=s e)/xqrhs</foreign> together
to signify “means of agreement,
reconciliation” (does not exist); and so
Stein renders: “between our hostile

renderings <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de/n</foreign> (or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de\n e)sti/</foreign>) is, of

the meaning would be that ‘the intervening

figure of AIIATH on the Dareios vase
(cp. c. 8 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) as a parallel. It would
have been a dangerous device to have
identified the figure with Dareios, for
example, as the shade of Dareios had
already done duty otherwise in the <title>Persai</title>
(cp. c. 11 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); but the dream of
Xerxes lacks concrete personality (contr.
dream of Kyros, 1. 209). For the story,
if authentic, only a Persian ‘provemence’
was possible; but Hdt.'s formula may
be no more than a literary device, and
the dream his own invention.</p></div>

of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n ei(/neken ktl.</foreign>).</p>
<p>ii. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\n *skuqiko/n</lem></app>: the repeated invasion

Skyths in pursuit of the Kimmerians.
The Kimmerian invasion of Asia Minor
is undoubtedly historical; cp. 1. 6, 15,
103, 4. 11-13. Historical also is the
invasion, probably the repeated invasions,
of Upper Asia by ‘Skyths,’ nomads
from the Oxus and Jaxartes region.
But the pursuit of the Kimmerians by
the (European) Skyths via Caucasus is
perhaps only a theory, a combination,
due to the ingenuity of Hdt. or of his
authorities; cp. Bks. IV.-VI., notes to
<foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> Hdt. speaking here <foreign rend="ital">propria persona</foreign>

116).</p>
<p>iv. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\n *musw=n te kai\ *teukrw=n</lem></app>. .
Hdt. is our oldest authority for this
supposed movement; other or later
authorities differ considerably from his
presentation of the matter (and to some
extent from each other). Six points in
the Herodotean account call for observation:
(i.) Mysiaus and Teukrians are
combined in the movement, which (ii.)
passes from Asia into Europe (iii.) via
the Bosporos, and (iv.) reaches the
Adriatic and the Peneios (v.) in a
more or less organized conquest (vi.)
dated before the Trojan war. It is
difficult to determine on what evidence
this theory was based: a clear and indepeudent
tradition for it can hardly
have existed, but there were evidences,
still recoverable, of real connexions between
Asia Minor and Thrace, of which
this theory is one possible solution, and
the Homeric poems played their part,
easily understood, in the argument.
Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign> (following Abel, apparently)
adduces five proofs in support of the
Herodotean theory, which he accepts;
they suggest the evidence, or a part of
the evidence, upon which the theory
may have been founded, but are not all
indisputably matters of fact, and so far
as true are equally or even more compatible
with the theory (found in later
writers, e.g. Strabo, but not therefore of
necessity based upon later or inferior
evidences) which represented the Mysian
(or Mysio-Teukrian) movement, if such
it was, as an invasion of Asia from
European Thrace. Those proofs are:—
(1) The Trojan or ‘Teukrian’ origin of the
Paionians on the Strymon, Hdt. 5. 13
(highly disputable, see <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). (2) The
presence of Paionian and kindred (Thracian)
stocks over the whole district from
the Adriatic to the Propontis (a fact
pointing to the European side as their
origiual or earlier habitat!). (3) The
expulsion of the Bithynians from the
Strymon into Asia by Teukrians and
Mysians, c. 75 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> (almost an absurdity
if Teukrians and Mysians are coming
from Asia!). (4) The existence of a
number of identical names (race- and
place-names) on both sides the Hellespont:
Strabo, p. 590 (quite compatible
with the European origin of the names).
(5) The fact that Priam <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Homerum
heads a confederation, which includes
the tribes of Thrace as far as the Axios
<pb n="31"/>
(no proof of a Tenkrian ‘conquest,’
much less immigration in Thrace).
Stein's (Abel's) proofs for Hdt.'s theory
are unconvincing; a closer examination
of Hdt.'s six points will further discredit
the argument. (i.) Hdt. plainly regards
the Teukrians as primitive Trojans (cp.
2. 118, 5. 13, 122), and the Mysians,
their allies, as primitive or early inhabitants
of the Troad, or of historic Mysia.
But Tenkrians are absolutely unknown
to Homer, and the only Mysians known
to the <title>Iliad</title> are at home in Europe (N
5, etc., except in the Catalogue, B 858
—of course late; cp. Thraemer, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.
infra</foreign> p. 337). Kallinos of Ephesos is
our oldest authority for ‘Teukrians,’
and he regarded them as immigrants,
<foreign rend="ital">l.c. infra.</foreign> Blakesley, from the silence
of Homer, rashly infers that “the <foreign rend="ital">name</foreign>
was certainly more recent than the
<title>Iliad</title>”; Kretschmer (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit. infra</foreign> p.
191), more judiciously, that the <title>Epos</title>
says nothing of Teukrians in the Troad,
because its design is to represent an
heroic period, prior to their immigration.
If immigrants, whence did they come?
Kallinos apparently brought them from
Krete (Strabo, p. 604); others brought
them from Attica (<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>). Each alternative
may be accounted for (though not
shortly enough for this note) and neither
is convincing. The latest modern tendency
is to connect the Teukrians of the
Troad with Kypros, either in virtue of
a common wide-spread stratum in the
Anatolian populations from the Hellespont
to Kypros, or it may be in virtue
of actual immigration from Kypros into
‘Mysia.’ Archaeological evidence, especially
the pottery, points to a connexion,
and that older than the <title>Epos,</title> between
the Troad and Kypros; and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*teu=kros</foreign>, the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*teukri/dai</foreign>, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*gergi=noi</foreign> (=<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ge/rgiqes</foreign>)
are found in Kypros and the neigh bourhood
(Kilikia); cp. further c. 43 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*teu=kros</foreign> the Eponym appears in the
<title>Iliad</title> among the Achaian heroes fighting
against Troy, a mighty bowman, bastard
of Telamon, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q</foreign> 284, and brother of
Aias, of Salamis. Pindar has the easily
understood legend of his colonizing
Kypros, <title>Nem.</title> 4. 46. There is also the
possibility that the ‘Teukrians’ of Mysia
were from Thrace—if the Mysians were.
In some ways this theory is attractive,
as it recognizes the supposed TenkroMysian
invasion of Europe (from which
the whole discussion starts), only inverting
it into a Teukro-Mysian invasion of
the Troad. In this case the ‘Teukri’
might have passed from the Troad to
Kypros, etc. But it is on the whole
more probable (<foreign rend="ital">me iudice</foreign>) that the
‘Teukrians,’ coming from Kypros, first
met and became associated with the
Mysians, coming from Thrace, in the
Troad, and have thus been made to
share the Mysian adventure. The
European and Thracian character of the
Mysians may be taken as proved by the
Homeric ethnography, even if the express
assertions of the later writers cannot be
cited as independent evidence (being
perhaps inference from the Homeric
facts); nor need we hesitate (if Kretschmer
<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> p. 211 etc. is to be trusted)
to see in the Moesi of the Roman empire
the same name and tribe in their original
habitat. Hdt. obvionsly treats the
‘Mysians’ as indigenons to Asia. Their
real or supposed affinity with the Lydians
and Karians (the strongest proof of which
is to be found in Hdt. 1. 171) is in
favour of this view; but if this affinity
is anything more than inferential and
factitious, it would point not to the
indigenons origin of the Mysians, but
to an external origin for Karians and
Lydians: Hdt. himself indeed brings
the Karians to Asia from outside (wrongly
in my opinion), and some of the moderns
would recognize a Thracian origin, or
element, in the ‘Lydians’ (cp. Radet,
<title>La Lydie,</title> pp. 53, 57; Forbiger, <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Pauly, <title>Real-Encycl.</title> iv. 1279). The
doctrine of the antochthonous character
of the Lydians was, of course, a ‘Lydian’
dogma, found in Hdt. and in Xanthos
Lydos; cp. c. 74 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> Xanth. <title>Frag.</title>
1. The remaining five points in Hdt.'s
theory quickly arrange themselves, once
the Tenkrians and the Mysians have
been acconnted for. (ii.) The Mysian
movement must be corrected into a
migration from Thrace into NW. Asia,
not conceived as an invasion of Thrace
by Asianics. It falls into place with
the series of such movemcnts, the
greatest of which flooded Asia with
‘Phrygians’; cp. c. 73 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> (iii.) The
tradition that the point of crossing was
the ‘Bosporos’ squares very ill with
Hdt.'s own conception of the source and
direction of the invasion, but agrees
extremely well with (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the Asiatic
position of the Mysians in the Homeric
Catalogue (<foreign rend="ital">l.c. supra</foreign>), also with (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the
<pb n="32"/>
historic position of the Moesians on the
Danube, and (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) is confirmed by the
entirely aceeptable tradition that the
Bosporos was named of old ‘the Mysian
Bosporos’ (Strabo, p. 566), and further (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>)
by Hdt.'s own record that the Mysian
movement drove the Bithynians from
the Enropean side into historic Bithynia.
(iv.) The extension of the Mysio-Teukrian
occupation in Hdt. to the shore of the
Adriatic and (the outlet of) the Peneios
might be explained by reference to the
homogeneity of the populations in the
northern Balkans (cp. Stein's second proof
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), but is rendered more easily intelligible
by reference to the tradition
preserved in Hellanikos, <title>Frag.</title> 46, that
once on a time the ‘Makedones’ dwelt
among the Mysians, i.e. the Mysians
occupied what was afterwards known as
Makedonia; and also to Hdt.'s own
record connecting the Phrygians with
Mt. Bermios, cp. 8. 138 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> (v.) That
Hdt. makes the movement an organized
invasion and conquest may be dismissed
as obviously a ‘pragmatic’ notion, demanded
by the occasion and comparison;
neither he nor any one else furnishes a
story for the action; and if the previous
argument is correct, any such story could
only have been fabulons. (vi.) Last, and
not least curious, Hdt. dates the event
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ tw=n *troikw=n</foreign>. The rival view represented
by Strabo and his authorities,
and adopted above, that the Mysian
migration was from Europe into Asia,
naturally dated the movement after the
Trojan war, as Mysians (and Teukrians)
are unknown in the Troad of Homer.
Hdt. is led to the earlier date by a
need to account for (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the presence of
Mysians in Homeric Thrace, and (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the
absence of Mysians and ‘Tenkrians’ in
Homeric Troy. But thereby his own
theory breaks down as not affording any
explanation for the presence of Mysians
and Teukrians in historic Mysia. Ed.
Thraemer's <title>Pergamos</title> (1888), ch. ii.,
contains an admirable discussion of the
‘Mysian’ problem, and P. Kretschmer's
<title>Einleitung in die Geschichte d. gr.
Sprache</title> (1896) corrects and supplements
the same, and deals admirably with the
question of the Teukrians. Without
these works, which entirely supersede
the lueubiations of Abel, Giseke, Stein,
Rawlinson, etc., on these points, the

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o( ga\r *)/aqws e)sti/ ktl.</lem></app> The topography
of Athos which follows challenges
comparison with Thuc. 4. 109, and does
not emerge altogether with credit. (1)
Hdt. gives no general name for the
peninsula (except Athos?); Thuc. supplies
the name Akte. Haack's idea that
<foreign xml:lang="greek">o&lt;*&gt; *)/aqws</foreign> is the mountain and  <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( *)/aqws</foreign>
the peninsula need not be maintained
in view of the emended text of Thuc.
5. 35 (cp. Stuart Jones's edition); but
<bibl n="Thuc. 5.82.1">Thuc. 5. 82. 1</bibl> seems to use <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)/aqws</foreign> of
the peninsula; cp. the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fo/ros</foreign> inscripp.
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">*die=s e)k to= *)/aqo</foreign>). (2) Hdt. distinguishes
on the peninsula the mountain Athos
rising out of the sea, and the low-lying
isthmos, correctly; he also gives the
breadth of the isthmos (which Thucydides
has no occasion to do) sufficiently correctly
at twelve stades; but the seas on
either side are described as the Akanthian
sea, and the sea ‘opposite Torone’: this
latter designation is a very strange one,
considering the site of Torone, especially
in relation to the ‘isthmus,’ and raises
a doubt whether Hdt. had visited these
parts before writing his description of
them. Thuc. also has a sea (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/lagos</foreign>)
on either side of the <foreign rend="ital">mountain,</foreign> and
names the one the ‘Aegean,’ and the
other the ‘Euboean,’ more correctly.
(3) Hdt. and Thuc. each name six and
the same six cities, or townships, on the
peninsula, but in somewhat different
order. Thuc. appears to enumerate the
six starting from Sane, and going round
in order from W. to E. side. Hdt. has
enumerated the six in the reverse order,
but has apparently transposed the positions
of Thyssos and Kleonai. (If this
observation is correct Dion ought, upon
the maps, to be placed SE. of Sane.)
With the exception of Akrothoon all the
names appear upon the Attic tributelists,
but the list of neither historian is
taken direct from the tribute-lists, on
which the order is not geographical.
(4) Thuc.'s ethnology of the region is
much fuller and more precise than Hdt.'s.
Hdt. indeed calls Sane a <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis *(ella/s</foreign>,
which may be taken to imply the presence
of non-Hellenic elements in the
neighbourhood. Thuc. goes further; Sane
he describes as a colony from Andros,
and the rest he peoples with <foreign xml:lang="greek">cummei/ktois
e)/qnesi barba)rwn diglw)sswn</foreign> Chalkidic,
Pelasgo-Tyrsenian, Bisaltian, Krestonaean,
Edonian! The comparison suggests the
conclusion that in his own description
of Akte Thuc. had this passage of Hdt.
in view. Strabo 331 (<title>Frag.</title> 35) gives
the five ‘Pelasgian’ townships as Kleonai,
Olophyxos, Akrothooi, Dion, Thyssos.
Hdt.'s <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)khm. u(po\ a)nqrw/pwn</foreign> is almost

perhaps upon some hearsay evidence,
not fully understood, turns rather to the

the evil may go somewhat deeper. The

sense of the upper edge, or edges of the

Phoenicians was (we may suspect) chiefly
displayed in the construction of the
dams, designed to prevent the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sto/mata

the action of tide or waves, as in c.

upon the aim and object of the Canal.
It was to serve (according to him) merely
as an exhibition of power and as a
memorial; otherwise, he thinks, the
Persian fleet might have been dragged
across the isthmos. His reasoning is
not very profound.</p>
<p>On his own showing the Persian fleet
consisted of 1207 ships of war, not to
speak of transports, etc. (3000); the
time and labour of moving such a fleet
from sea to sea on rollers, or a <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/olkos</foreign>,
would have been immense (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mhde/na po/non
labo/ntas</foreign>!) Greek ships in small numbers
were from time to time transported in
this way over rather smaller distances
(cp. Thuc. 3. 81, 4. 8); but the application
of such methods to the king's fleet,
even if practicable, would have involved
a great loss of time. (Those who study
to reduce the fleet of Xerxes to the
smallest dimensions are entitled to cite
this passage in support of their contention
for what it is worth; the alternative
must be to see in it an illustration
of snperficiality and inconsequence in
Hdt.'s philosophy—no new thing.) Hdt.
and the popular traditions he here
follows made too much of the Canal as a
wonder-work. It was really a simple
<pb n="37"/>
bit of engineering (“it might without
much labour be renewed,” Leake, <title>North.
Greece,</title> iii. 145), not as difficult of
execution, in the soft soil of the isthmos,
as the projected canal at Knidos (1. 174),
or the canal recently cut through the
rocky isthmos of Korinth (and often
projected in antiquity, from the days of
Periander, Diog. L. 1. 99, to those of
Nero, cp. B. W. Henderson, <title>Life and
Principate of the Emperor Nero,</title> 1903,
p. 386), or the canals in Egypt (especially
that carried by Dareios from the Nile
into the Red Sea (2. 158, 4. 39)—to say
nothing of modern instances. The
Greeks who controlled but small supplies
of labour viewed such works with
exaggerated astonishment, and saw a
hint of impiety (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>) in them. Cp.
c. 22 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p>It is not necessary to rush to the other
extreme and see in the Athos, or AkteCanal,
an evidence of a far-seeing commercial
policy, determined to improve
the trade-routes of the empire. The
simpler, indeed, and easier the work, the
more adequate is the immediate strategic
purpose, suggested in the narrative of
Hdt. beside his own theory and motivation.
In that case the Canal served its
purpose, and afterwards fell into disuse
with the retirement of the Persian from
Europe; there was no adequate motive,
either strategic or commercial, for maintaimiug
it, and no doubt it would have
required constant dredging and repairs.
The existence of the Canal need never
have been doubted (as by Juvenal, 10.
174); not only is its reality guaranteed
by Thuc. 4. 109 as well as by Hdt., but
actual traces of the course of the Canal
are still visible <foreign rend="ital">in loco</foreign>; cp. Leake,
<title>North. Greece,</title> iii. 144. Whether the
Canal, however, was actually used by
the fleet of Xerxes has been doubted.
Demetrios of Skepsis, <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Strabon. 6.
331, <title>Fr.</title> 35, asserted that though the
Canal was begun it was never finished,
as a ledge of rock existed a stade wide
apparently near the sea at the S. (SW.)
end, “which it would be impossible to
quarry right across to the sea, or at any
rate to cut into deep enough to render
it navigable.” Stem regards this as the
testimony of an eyewitness, and accepts
it as final (like Juvenal), but it was not
for the eyewitness to say what was
possible or impossible, but to depose to
the facts: was there a cutting through
the rocky ledge (if it exists) or not?
Unfortunately the political condition of
the locality at present renders archaeological
or topographical inquiries a
matter of great difficulty; but Leake
does not notice any such obstacle, and
treats the Canal as a simple feat of
engineering.</p></div>

feet), which would not be wide enough
for two triremes to row abreast (Stein).

tioned just above, though there were to
be two bridges over the Hellespont.
But probably the other larger rivers in
Thrace were bridged too (Hebros and
Nestos, and probably the Axios in
Macedonia), so that at least half a dozen
large bridges are here in question; and
they may all have been ‘pontoons’ rather
than such bridges as Caesar threw
across the Rhine (cp. <title>B.G.</title> 4. 17). As to

point ‘St. George.’ Stein identifies it
(for reasons not given) with Alkibiades'
castle in this district. 2. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*turo/diza</lem></app>,
placed by Stephanos B. near Serrhion
(cp. c. 59 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), i.e. near the mouth of
the Hebros (cp. Forbiger, <title>Alte Geogr.</title>
iii. 1074), a position which (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) comes
too near Doriskos, the next depôt mentioned,
and (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) lies too far from Perinthos
for the qualification <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n *perinqi/wn</foreign>. A
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*turo/diza</foreign> appears in the Hellespontine
region, among the tributaries of Athens,
on the <title>Quota-Lists</title> (five times), paying
from 1000 to 500 Dr. The order of
names within the region not being geographical,
we cannot fix precisely the
site of Tyrodiza from these lists, but it
cannot have been within the ‘Thracian’
region. Kiepert's map places it close to
Perinthos, perhaps on the strength of
this passage. Stein proposes to identify
it with <foreign xml:lang="greek">*teiri/stasis</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">leg.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*turo/stasis</foreign>), which
brings it close to Leuke Akte, and connects
the name with ‘Tyre’ (Phoenician)
and Thracian <foreign rend="ital">dizo</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign>. (The Phoenician
reference is rather far-fetched.)
Perhaps the depôt at Leuke Akte was the
same under another name (cp. the confusion
in the text here, App. Crit.). In
any case these depôts on the Propontis,
especially if there was one as far east
as Perinthos, suggest the Pontos as the
source of the corn supply (cp. the absurd

Akte, or Tyrodiza, Doriskos, Eion and

stations on the subsequent advance of
the Persians; but it is possible that the
list here given is by no means exhaustive

The identification of Kritalla
is still a problem in Anatolian geography.
It is generally assumed (e.g. by Baehr,
Rawlinson, Stein) that (1) Xerxes advanced
by the Royal Road (5. 52 f.,
cp. Hdt. IV.-VI. Appendix XIII.) and
(2) that the Royal Road did not pass
through the Kilikian Gates. On these
principles Rennel's proposed identification
of Kritalla with Archelais (<title>Erekli</title>)
falls to the ground; but cp. Appendix
II. § 3. Blakesley suggested that the
name contains the <foreign rend="ital">cert-</foreign> or <foreign rend="ital">crit-</foreign> (seen in
Tigrano <foreign rend="ital">certa</foreign>) =castra and Halys (-alla),
note to 5. 52, but supposed that the
Halys in question is not the well-known
Halys, but another river of the same
name. Kritalla must represent some
important station and junction (‘Knotenpunkt’)
between the Euphrates and the
Halys, but it is possible that Hdt. is
mistaken in thinking that the king
actually crossed the Halys on his march
westwards. Cp. Appendix II. § 3.</p></div>

Hdt. distinguishes a column of the army

words, however, above cited involve an
important (though perhaps not fully

muster at Kritalla (as indeed common

Hdt. apparently conceived the Halys as
flowing, in a straight line N., across
Asia Minor, cp. 1. 72; on that plan
you could hardly come westward at all
without crossing it. If the king really
crossed the Halys (here as elsewhere
plainly the boundary between ‘Phrygia’
and ‘Kappadokia’) it would no doubt
have been by the bridge on the Royal
Road near Pteria (cp. Hdt. IV.-VI.

the king far to the south at Kelainai it

lay across the true Halys at all. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(mi/lhsan</lem></app>,

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*kelaina/s</lem></app>. Of the practical identity
of Kelainai with Apameia (<title>Dineir</title>) there
is no doubt (Hamilton, <title>Asia Minor,</title>

<title>Asia Mi.</title> (1890), p. 41.</p>
<p>The position has been (and might perhaps
again be) one of great commercial
and strategic importance, “commanding
the great road from the Lycus valley to
the interior.” The natural features of
the landscape have also made the spot
a centre of romance and history. Xerxes
built a palace there on his return
journey, if we may trust <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 1.2.9">Xen. <title>Anab.</title> 1. 2.
9</bibl>. Kyros the younger also had a palace
and a paradise there, Xen. 1. 2. 7. Alexander
visited and reduced the stronghold
in 334-3, Arrian, <title>Anab.</title> 1. 29. 1.
It was also an important centre in
Roman times. “The most striking
feature of Dineir is the group of
springs that form the headwaters of
the Maeander.” A famous coin of
Apameia shows the local goddess surrounded
by four river-gods with the
legend MAI: MAP: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*q</foreign>ER: OR: that is,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*mai/andros, *marsu/as, *qe/rma, *)orga/s</foreign>. The
third can only mean the modern Ilidja,
the single hot spring of Dineir (wrongly
identified by Hirschfeld with the Marsyas),
Hogarth, <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> p. 348, identifying it with
“the lost Obrimas of Pliny” (<title>Nat. Hist.</title>
5. 29), who does not mention a Therma.
The Orgas is found in the Sheikh Arab
Chai (Murray, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 106), which rises
in the S. and winds round a hill to join
the ‘Maeander’ or the ‘Marsyas,’ according
to the identification of those
names with the two remaining streams
of the locality. On this point Hogarth
is at issue with Hirschfeld, a difference
arising from the fact that Hirschfeld
has followed Strabo 835 in the identification
of the Maeander with “the central and
most striking source,” the Hudaverdy,
while Hogarth shows that Xenophon
identified that stream with the Marsyas,
and gives some reason to think that
the name of the Maeandei might have
shifted from the one source to the other
between the time of Xenophon and
Strabo. This hypothesis seems preferable
to the alternative supposition, that
there have been violent natural convulsions
in the landscape, in order to
explain the failure of any other stream
but the Hudaverdy, or Maeander, of
Strabo and Hirschfeld, to correspond
with the ancient descriptions of the
Marsyas. Mr. Hogarth's solution of the
whole difficulty is that “the Maeander
had <gap/> no distinct source <gap/> but was
simply the united river formed by the
junction of the Marsyas, Obrimas (or
Therma), and Orgas.”</p>
<p>Hdt.'s description of the place makes
it pretty certain that he is not writing
from autopsy. He mentions only two
streams, and, though he refers to the
legend of Marsyas, he names the second
stream, “as big as the Marandros,” the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">katarrh/kths</foreign>—rather a descriptive epithet
than a proper name; nor did the stream
rise in the market-place (prohably),
though the Agora may have been just
under the Akropolis, from a cave on
which the Marsyas apparently flowed
(Xenophon <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>). Moreover Hdt. makes
no mention of the palace built by Xerxes.
<pb n="41"/>
(Blakesley's idea that the palace, though
ascribed to Xerxes, was post-Herodotean
is the more violent hypothesis.)</p></div>

<title>Frag.</title> 33. 7; Bergk, ii.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> p. 54, apparently
as a proverbial expression). The <foreign rend="ital">motif</foreign>
was frequently used for the plot of satyrdramas
(Jessen in Roscher's <title>Lexikon,</title>
2440). That the actual story is of
‘Phrygian’ origin (as Hdt. asserts)
appears very improbable; it is thoroughly
Greek in tendency, and signifies the
victory of the Hellenic god and his
instrument or his art over the barbarian
and his blow-pipes. The formula <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po\
*frugw=n lo/gos e)/xei</foreign> shows, indeed, how
little weight can be attached to such
‘Quellen-citate’; cp. Introduction, § 10.
The ‘flaying’ may be ‘Phrygian’ (a
‘barbarous’ punishment, cp. Hastings,
<title>Dict. of Bible,</title> i. (1898) 525), as the figure
of Marsyas himself, ‘the spring-demon
and piper,’ is originally. But perhaps
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)sko/s</foreign> in the first instance was only
the bellows of the bag-pipes? Stein
sees in it a symbol of the Source. The
native name of the river at Kelainai was
Masnes or Masses (<title>F. H. G.</title> iv. 629):
when the Masses was converted into the
Marsyas (cp. Hdt. 5 118) the symbol
was converted into the piper's own skin.
But this exegesis presupposes the myth.
It is more natural to think of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)sko/s</foreign>
as a wine-skin and to connect it with the
‘Silenos.’ In regard to ‘Silenos’ Stein
notes that others made him a ‘Satyr’;
Rawlinson shows that ‘Silenos’ was
originally the chief Satyr. Marsyas, in
opposition to Apollo and Athene, is
associated with Dionysos (Silenos) and
with Kybele (flute-music). The contest
was a favourite subject in Greek literature
and art, of which one classic example
is to be seen on the celebrated Manti&lt;*&gt;eian
frieze (now in Athens), another on one
of the Sidonian sarcophagi (now in
Constantinople); see further on the
myth and its representations Jessen in

Pliny 17.38.2, Xerxes visited (Laodiceae,
Xerxis adventu, platano in oleam mutata):
the town necessarily bore some other name
in 481: Baehr follows Schoell in accepting
this alternative; (iii.) with Karura
of Strabo, 578 (Leake), which Blakesley
denies, on the ground that Strabo makes
it the frontier of Phrygia and <title>Karia</title>;
but the three regions (Phrygia, Lydia,
Karia) came to a point here; and (iv.)
G. Radet (<title>Lydie,</title> pp. 32, 34 f.) identifies
Kydrara with Karura, and both with
Sara-Keui, a small town at the junction
of two great roads (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) up and down the
Maeander valley, between the sea and the
plateau, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) through valleys of Kogamos
and Lykos to the gulf of Adalia. “The
road to Sardes undoubtedly passed
through the opening in Mount Messogis
where Tripolis stands (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>), and then
struck into the valley of the Cogamus”
(Rawlinson), i.e. ‘stood,’ for “most of
the buildings have disappeared” (Murray,
<title>Asia Minor,</title> p. 107). Tripolis was a
Pergamene foundation “to counterbalance
the Seleucid proclivities of Laodicea”
(<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign>). Perhaps Karura was only a small
place even in antiquity (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kw/mh <gap/> pandoxei=a
e)/xousa</foreign>, Strabo), but nevertheless
important as a fiontier station (where
custom-dues were collected, Blakesley).
If Kydrara was a frontier station in the
time of Kroisos, it follows that (1) Lydia
did not extend to the Halys, or at least
to the Halys-meridian throughout; (2)
there was a great trade - route already
running E. (SE.) from Sardes other
than the Royal Road. In other words,
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">koinh/</foreign> described by Strabo is as
ancient as the days of Kroisos at least.
It was this route which the younger
Kyros took in 401: why not Xerxes in

The mission of these heralds at this
point to demand ‘earth and water’ is
a little puzzling, and seems the more
confused by the secondary purpose of
commandeering dinners for the king.
The motivation for this second mission
(Xerxes wished to find out exactly how
little resistance he had to expect) is
quaintly, not to say awkwardly put: a
symptom of some unsoundness in the
passage. That these heralds were sent
everywhere (<foreign xml:lang="greek">th=| te a)/llh| pa/nth|</foreign>) in Hellas
but to Athens and Lakedaimon is vague,
to say the least of it; a list of cities or
tribes here would have been more convincing.
Finally, the absence of any
reason for the exceptions here is doubly
remarkable, in view of cc. 133-137 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>
As the king wished to punish Athens
for Marathon (c. 8 1. 30 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) there is
no need to explain why Athens was not
included in the scope of the heralds'
instructions; but the omission of Sparta
is not so easy to account for if Hdt. was
acquainted with the story, cc. 133 ff.
<foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> when he first wrote this passage.
Perhaps this text belongs to the earliest
draft of the seventh book, and the chief
problem is to explain the insertion of
that story below rather than in this
place; cp. notes <foreign rend="ital">ad l.,</foreign> and Introduction,

might be natural extensions of the
fetters: the Hellespont was to be not
merely a slave in fetters, but a whipped

Grote) defeuds “the several points of
this narrative” from “the sceptical (!)
doubts” of Larcher, Muller, Thirlwall,

the apocryphal “message of insult to

is very unfortunate for the authority of
Hdt. Hdt. 1. 202 (vengeance exercised
by Cyrus on the river Gynges) cited
by Grote as a parallel case, being itself
even more obviously apocryphal, cannot
save this anecdote. The branding, indeed,
is too much for Hdt. himself (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/dh

the Hellespontine water was to be
‘branded’ unless it was first bottled is
not very obvious.) No doubt the items
are “in keeping with the character of
an Oriental despot,” i.e. the conventional
character, a point which explains the
ease with which the story was invented,
or developed, but is little guarantee for
the truth of the items narrated. Duncker
(iv. 726 <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Stein) has indeed remarked

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)zeu/gnusan de\ w(=de</lem></app>: instead of describing
the bridges as they might
have appeared, when complete, to the
eye, Hdt., who, of course, could no
more have seen them than we ourselves,
follows the Homeric method of recording
the process of their manufacture.
He appears to distinguish four main
stages in the process:—I. The <foreign rend="ital">synthesis</foreign>
of ships. II. The discharge of the
anchors. III. The placing of the cables
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta de\ poih/santes ktl.</foreign>). IV. The
formation of the roadway (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)peidh\ de\ e)gefurw/qh
ktl</foreign>.). It is not easy, however,
to understand how the ‘synthesis’ of
the ships could have been accomplished
without the employment of anchors
and of cables from the first, and the
whole description bristles with problems,
larger or smaller, too complicated to
be adequately discussed here; but cp.
Appendix II. § 4.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="4">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">sunqe/ntes</lem></app>. How this ‘synthesis’
of pentekonters and triremes was accomplished
is not clear. Each vessel
might have been moored independently,
in line with the rest, but the anchors
to be next mentioned are not (according
to Hdt.) to prevent the vessels from
being swept away by the current. but
for a different purpose. Or the vessels
might have been attached to each other
by ropes, or cables; but if so, Hdt.
should have made that clear: and,
moreover, what are the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pla</foreign> there for
finally? The words <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po\ me\n th\n ktl.</foreign>
(sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/furan</foreign>) can hardly be taken to
prove that the bridges, and therefore
the cables, were already in place across
the strait, but are obviously used, so to
speak, proleptically. It is a further
defect that Hdt. does not specify whether
the vessels touched each other, thwart
to thwart, or whether there was an
interval, and if so, how much of an
interval, between ship and ship. There
is no difficulty in understanding why
the two bridges had a different number
of boats in them, for even if parallel to
each other, they need not have been
the same length. (Grote remarks that
taking the breadth to be one mile or
5280 ft., 360 vessels of an average
breadth of 142/3 ft. would exactly fill
the spacc.) Nor does Hdt. specify the
respective numbers of triremes and of
pentekonters employed; but he plainly
conceives of both classes of vessels as
employed in each bridge, though Kraz
(<title>Abhandlung,</title> 1851) assigns all the
<pb n="51"/>
triremes to the one bridge, and all the
pentekonters to the other. Grote speaks
(iv. 118) of “triremes and pentekonters
blended together” in each bridge, and
“moored across the strait breastwise
with their sterns towards the Euxine
and their heads towards the Aegean”:
what a blend! what a muddle!</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou= me\n *po/ntou e)pikarsi/as</lem></app>, ‘at

means not merely <foreign xml:lang="greek">pla/gios</foreign> ‘schrag’ (as
Stein takes it) but at right angles (as
Grote rightly). There is nothing in 1.
180, 4. 101 against this, but the reverse,
and Hdt. could have expressed the
oblique angle, if that had been his
intention. Moreover, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pikarsi/as</foreign> must
refer to all the ships, of both bridges,
alike, and shows that in relation to
each other the ships are all conceived as
in parallels. There is nothing to justify
our understanding <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= me\n *po/ntou e)pikarsi/as</foreign>
only of the vessels of the longer
(or northern) bridge, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= de\ *(ellhspo/ntou
kata\ r(o/on</foreign> only of the vessels of
the shorter (or southern) bridge; nor
again to justify us in restricting the
whole phrase to the shorter bridge.
Taking <foreign xml:lang="greek">*po/ntou</foreign> to be the true text, the
passage would prove Hdt. aware that
the Hellespont forms an angle, and
indeed a right angle with the Pontos—
a conception by no means applicable
to the general lie of the Hellespont,
but precisely accurate of the portion
of the Hellespont lying between Abydos
and Madytos, though not of the portion
lying between Abydos and Sestos. But
(i.) so precise an orientation, and with
reference to the remote Pontos, is neither
after Hdt.'s way nor specially applicable
to his proper audience; (ii.) the bridges
cross, according to him, not from Abydos
to Madytos, much less S. of Madytos,
as this orientation might suggest, but
distinctly N. of Madytos and towards
Sestos. There is, then, something to
be said for Schweighaeuser's conjecture
<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/rou</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/ntou</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/ros</foreign> being understood
of the ‘passage’ to be formed
across the Hellespont by the bridge, or
bridges, when completed. The change
of reading makes no difference to the
actual orientation of either bridge, or of
the boats forming it, but delivers the
text from an almost inexplicably remote
reference. Nor is the statement that
the boats are at right angles to the
passage across them quite inane, as is
proved by the theory of some commentators
that the boats were, and were by
Hdt. conceived as, at an oblique angle
to the parallel cables drawn across them
from shore to shore.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="7">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou= de\ *(ellhspo/ntou kata\ r(o/on</lem></app>,
that is, ‘parallel to the stream of the
Hellespont.’ The question arises, whether
Hdt. conceived the stream, or current,
setting down the Hellespont as parallel
to the coast lines, which, of course, are
not precisely parallel to each other, or
whether he was aware, as was Strabo,
that the current in the Heptastadion
sets from the European to the Asiatic
side, so that in order to cross from Asia
to Europe the ferry started 8 stades
above Abydos, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/peita diai/rein pla)gion kai\
mh\ tele/ws e)na/ntion e)/xousi to\n r\ou=n</foreign> (Strabo
591). But had Hdt. been acquainted
with this remarkable fact, would he
not have stated it clearly? Hdt. probably
conceives the current as generally
parallel to the coast, and the boats as
heading directly up stream, likewise
parallel to the coasts, or, more strictly,
to the current, and traversed at right
angles by the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pla</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/fura</foreign>, the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/ros</foreign> (there is absolutely no justification
for saddling Hdt. with Grote's idea that
the boats ‘had their heads towards the
Aegean’).</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">i(/na a)nakwxeu/h| to\n to/non tw=n

The most obvious subject is <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( r(o/os</foreign> understood
out of the foregoing, or more
generally <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ w(=de sunqei=nai</foreign> (so Sitzler);
and even if Reiske's or Stein's possible
plural for the verb were adopted the
sense would not be substantially altered
(whether a personal subject or <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai( ne/es</foreign>
were supplied); <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nakwxeu/ei</foreign> seems impos<pb n="52"/>
sible, though <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/na</foreign> might be taken with
it as locative. The phrase, however,
is capable of contrary interpretations.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nakwxeu/santes ta\s ne/as</foreign> 6. 116 ‘stayed
their ships’; <foreign xml:lang="greek">a/nekw/xeue</foreign> 9. 13 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign>
absolutely ‘stayed,’ ‘waited’; but here,
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n to/non t. o(/pl.</foreign>, ‘to stay the
stretch of the ropes,’ may mean (i.) ‘to
prevent the ropes being over-stretched,’
or (ii.) ‘to support the ropes when
stretched,’ or even (iii.) ‘to maintain or
keep up the stretch of the ropes,’ the
strain on the ropes, i.e. to keep them
taut. By <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ o(/pla</foreign> the cables stretched
from shore to shore are generally understood:
very naturally, if <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n o(/plwn tou=
to/nou</foreign> is to be read l. 21 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> The
method of mooring the boats could
hardly affect the strain on these cables,
or keep them taut; and indeed the
stretching and tightening of these great
cables is subsequently accounted for by
windlasses on shore: this interpretation
therefore must be dismissed. If the
meaning be ‘to support the cables when
stretched across from shore to shore,’
then <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n to/non tw=n o(/plwn</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ o(/pla

and the sense, though unimpeachable, is
insignificant. The same remark applies
to interpretation (i.). If by <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n o(/plwn</foreign>,
however, be understood (with Baehr)
the ropes, or cables, securing the anchors
just about to be mentioned, then the
phrase, though still wanting in lucidity,
gives a good sense: mooring the vessels
down stream kept the cables taut, by
which they were moored.</p></div>

That the ‘synthesis’ of the ships was
complete before (II.) the anchors were let
go seems an inconsequence that arises
from Hdt.'s having attempted to
enarrate the process of building instead
of describing the bridges as finished
structures. Otherwise, we should have
to suppose that the bridges were constructed
on shore, floated out into midstream,
and anchored, not necessarily
complete, but it might be in lengths—
a process which would ill accord with
the rest of Hdt.'s narrative description,
though it is a conceivable way of
making a bridge, and would accord with
this curious separation of the ‘synthesis’
of ships and the anchoring.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="9">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta\s me/n</lem></app>, sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a/gku/ras</foreign>. The passage
in the vulgate, even as amended by the
anonymous but indispensable <foreign xml:lang="greek">zefu/rou</foreign> for
<foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)/rou</foreign>, involves Hdt. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) in the slight
stylistic inconsequence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s me/n</foreign> answered
by <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s de\ e(te/rhs</foreign>, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) in the serious material
absurdity that one bridge had all its
anchors on the up side, and the other
bridge had all its anchors on the down
side: how the lower bridge, or rather
the vessels of the lower bridge, could
remain in their places, at least at this
stage of the proceedings, and before the
cables from shore to shore have been
stretched across them, and attached to
them, does not appear. If the boats
of the upper bridge had anchors let
down from the bows, then the ships of
the lower bridge must have had anchors
from the bows; and if the lower bridge
had anchors from the sterns of its
vessels, then the vessels of the upper
bridge likewise, no doubt, had anchors
from the sterns. This sense, or description,
would be obtained by deleting <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s
e(te/rhs</foreign> and substituting <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s de/</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s de\
e(te/rhs</foreign>. (Grote obtains the same result
by understanding “<foreign xml:lang="greek">me/ridos, teleuth=s</foreign>, or
some word indicating direction”: which
was rather too much for Hdt. to expect
in this passage.) Even as so amended
the text leaves Hdt. responsible for the
apparent absurdity that the purpose of
the anchors, even those from the prows
of the vessels, was not to counteract the
natural pressure of the stream, or current,
but to counteract the effects of the winds.
This implies, if it has any sense at all,
that the boats were to be kept in their
places by the great cables stretched
across them: to which, however, Hdt.
assigns no such purpose below. Whatever
the intention of the builders, the
certain effect of the stem-anchors would
have been to lighten the strain of the
current upon the whole structure of the
bridge—and one is almost tempted to
transfer the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/na a)nakwxeu/h|</foreign> (or
<foreign xml:lang="greek">-wsi</foreign>) so as to follow <foreign xml:lang="greek">a/gku/ras kath=kan

These words are adverse to the view
that Hdt. conceived the bridges as
running E. and W. or the Hellespont as
flowing S. through the Heptastadion;
west and south-west sufficiently well
describe the general direction, and the
more precise orientation would probably
have been beyond Hdt.'s resources, even
after a personal visit to the spot (cp. c.

last word is an emendation, but a fairly
certain one; cp. App. Crit. It is not
likely that three different openings were
provided in each bridge for the passage
of smaller crafts. The text will mean
that where the pentekonters and the
triremes joined, an opening was provided.
(If the pentekonters had been all
in one bridge, and the triremes all in
the other, we should expect <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n trihre/wn</foreign>.)
The remark throws some light
on the structure of the bridges, but
the respective positions of pentekonters
and triremes remain unfortunately undetermined.
Were the pentekonters all
together in one place in each bridge, or
distributed? If together, were they in
the middle, or at oue side? and so forth.
If, as is possible, the pentekonters formed
movable blocks in the bridges which could
be slung out, in order to allow of the
navigation continuing, powerful cables
and capstans might have been employed
for performing that operation. (On
Grote's ‘blend’ see above.) <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(po/fausin</lem></app>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tau=ta de\ poih/santes</lem></app>. Hdt.
distinguishes (III.) the slinging of the
cables from land across the boats, which
he treats as the veritable <foreign xml:lang="greek">gefu/rwsis</foreign>,
from (I.) the ‘synthesis’ of the boats
and (II.) the anchoring of the boats in
line across the channel. Whether the
cables were fastened to the boats and
the boats to the cables, or whether the
cables simply rested upon the boats;
whether the eables were each in one
length, or whether there were in each
several lengths, and so on, are questions
which he neither resolves nor even raises.
The stage in the process of construction
which he is now describing savours more
of a suspension bridge than of a pontoon,
of bridge of boats. Grote, who seems
to think Hdt. shows neither ‘ignorance’
nor ‘incorrectness’ in his description of
the bridges, observes that “the essential
portion of the bridge is the continuous
way across from bank to bank, which,
in the case of a narrow stream, may
exist without any supports at all.” But
the parallel cables laid over the vessels,
‘resting upon them, and stretching
across from bank to bank’ (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) do not
by themselves constitute such a way,
without the further treatment described
by Hdt. below (IV.).</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="15">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o)/noisi</lem></app>: capstans, windlasses
(though ‘ass’ in windlass is but a chance
coincidence); the use of the word recalls
our ‘donkey-engines,’ or still more
exactly the ‘mule’ in a cotton mill.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="16">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e(ka/tera</lem></app>, ‘each set,’ or ‘sort’
(force of the plural). There were six
cables in all used for each bridge, two
of ‘sparto’ and four of ‘papyros,’ the
size and finish of each kind being alike,
<pb n="54"/>
the specific gravity of sparto or grassrope
being greater, for it weighed ‘a
talent per cubit.’ How much the papyros
weighed Hdt. does not say, nor does he
specify how these cables were arranged;
whether e.g. the sparto-cables were exterior,
and the papyros-cables within,
or otherwise. Nor does Hdt. specify
exactly what ‘talent’ he had in view.
Could this be determined we might
calculate (1) the weight of the cubit of
esparto-cable; (2) the weight of the
whole cable, approximately 8 stades, or
about a mile long; (3) the approximate
size or thickness (<foreign xml:lang="greek">paxu/ths</foreign>=<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/xos</foreign>) of
each cable. As the cables were subsequently
captured and taken to Athens
(9. 121 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) they may have been
weighed there, and Hdt. may be drawing
on an Attic source; the Phoenician
makers would have reckoned by their
own weights and measures. (Similarly
the cubit here would be the mean Greek
cubit=11/2 feet, not the ‘Samian’ or
‘Egyptian,’ for example, 2. 168.) If
Attic weight is here used the ‘emporic’
talent is presumably intended, weighing
82 lbs. avoirdupois—a truly stupendous
weight of rope, 542/3 lbs. per foot!
(Stein gives the <foreign xml:lang="greek">paxu/ths</foreign> as about 33&lt;*&gt;8
inches (<title>Zoll</title>): “the stoutest modern
cable is only 24.”) The cables which
Hdt. has here in view would have suited
a suspension bridge. The anchors above
mentioned also require cables. If any
section, or sections, of the bridges were
capable of being slipped back and forward
into place, cables would be required
for such an operation. Finally, if the
bridges were made in lengths and floated
out into position, or even put in position,
ship by ship, cables would be
used to control the movement. Hdt.'s
account of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pla</foreign> leaves much to be
desired, in form as in substance; cp.

There follows (IV.) the fourth stage in
the process as apparently conceived by
Hdt., viz. the formation of the actual
roadway. <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/ros</foreign> is a little ambiguous,
and might mean the passage or waterway
across which the bridge was stretched,
or the passage or roadway formed by
the construction of the bridge itself.
It has the former meaning in c. 183

in c. 10 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pantoi=oi e)ge/nonto

<div type="commline" n="20">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kormou\s cu/lwn katapri/santes.</lem></app> <foreign xml:lang="greek">kormoi/</foreign> are ‘logs,’ which, when ‘sawn
up’ (as we say), would make ‘planks’;
these were as ‘long’ as the ‘frame’
or ‘pontoon’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sxedi/h</foreign>: sc. of each bridge)
was ‘wide’ (the exact measurement unfortunately
not given). These planks
had no doubt been got ready before the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">gefu/rwsis</foreign> was accomplished; they were
laid in order above the cables (<foreign rend="ital">dele</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=
to/nou</foreign> RWM), and bound down upon
them (<foreign xml:lang="greek">au)=tis e)pezeu/gnuon</foreign>), either by
separate ties, or possibly by some of the
great cables (perhaps the ‘papyros’)
being put down along them. It is but a
further stage of the same process of
road-making that brushwood (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/lh</foreign>) was
then laid down evenly upon the planks,
and earth spread and stamped or rammed
tight (<foreign xml:lang="greek">katana/cantes</foreign>) on the top of the
brushwood. The bridge is completed
by a bulwark (<foreign xml:lang="greek">fragmo/s</foreign>) of planks, on
either side, to prevent the sumpter-beasts
being scared by sight of the water. This
remark should apply to the bridge on
the Aegean side for the commissariat
(cp. c. 55 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>); presumably there was
a railing, or some protection, along the
other one too, although Hdt. does not
say so.</p>
<p>There are two systems of building
pontoons, as distinguished from ‘suspension’
and from ‘sublician’ bridges,
on one or other of which the bridges over
the Hellespont must have been constructed.
A. The one of these is virtually
described by Arrian, in a well-known
passage of the <title>Anabasis Alexandri,</title> 5. 7,
as the Roman method employed on the
<pb n="55"/>
Danube, Rhine, Euphrates, and Tigris.
Ships are allowed to drift down the
current, stern foremost, to the given
spot, where they are stayed by a galley
with oars, to which they are attached
(presumably each ship to a separate
galley?), and which rows or paddles
against the stream while the next operation
is accomplished. While this galley
is rowing or paddling against the stream,
large baskets of picked stones are dropped
from the stem of each ship, forming the
pontoon, and serve as anchors. The
ships are thus arranged at intervals from
each other all across the stream, with
their stems to the current; and from
ship to ship beams (<foreign xml:lang="greek">cu/la</foreign>) are laid
lengthwise, and planks (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sani/des</foreign>) at right
angles (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)gka/rsiai</foreign>) to bind them together
(this work beginning as soon as two
ships have been successfully moored near
enough to each other, and proceeding on
both sides, every ship having a working
party on board) until the whole passage
is bridged by the requisite number of
ships (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/sai i(kanai\ gefurw=sai to\n po/ron</foreign>).
At each end fixed gangways (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kli/makes</foreign>)
project from the bank to the bridge,
which serve as a safe approach for horses
and beasts, and also keep the pontoon
in its place.</p>
<p>With this kind of bridge and bridgebuilding
Arrian contrasts the method
here reported by Hdt. (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s le/gei *(hro/dotos
o( *(alikarnasseu\s zeuxqh=nai to\n *(ellh/sponton</foreign>),
by which <foreign xml:lang="greek">cundeqei=sai ai( nh=es sxoi/nois
kai\ kata\ stoi=xon o(rmisqei=sai e)s to\ zeu=gma
a)ph/rkesan</foreign>. But Arrian has apparently
a little forgotten his Herodotus! One
great difference he does indeed rightly
signalise between the Roman method
and that here described. There is
nothing in the Roman bridge corresponding
to the colossal <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/pla</foreign>, which
give the bridge of Xerxes somewhat the
air of a suspension-bridge. For the rest,
the floating of the ships stern foremost
down stream, and their mooring, just
on the Roman system, seems to be involved
in Hdt.'s account, though he
does not specify the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kelh/tion e)ph=res</foreign>
which is necessary to this operation,
unless indeed the pentekonters mentioned
by him should be taken out of
the bridge, and definitely assigned to
this service. The place of the gangways
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">kli/makes</foreign>) too on the Roman bridge is
taken by the shore ends of the cables
with Hdt.; but this is a mere detail of
difference.</p>
<p>B. The substantial alternative to the
Roman method of throwing a bridge
across a stream, and to the method
described by Hdt. which appears to
correspond in essentials to the Roman
method, is not specified by Arrian, and
would be to form pontoons on shore,
or close to shore, of vessels bound or
fastened together, and then float these
pontoons, with the shore ends securely
fastened, out into the stream, and either
moor them or bind them together, or
both moor them independently and
attach them to each other at their
juncture. Such a method would give
a less stable result than the method
described by Arrian; but some hints of
such a process seem to shimmer through
the description of the bridge-building
in Hdt. (e.g. the separation of the
‘synthesis’ of the ships from the anchoring;
the descriptions of the cables and
windlasses, which seem quite <foreign rend="ital">de trop</foreign> for
the formation of the roadway, in anything
but a suspension-bridge—of which
there may have been examples, of course
on a smaller scale, in Asia, which have
affected the Herodotean account of the
Hellespontine structure). The real use
of the great cables and windlasses may
<pb n="56"/>
have been (1) to control the great
pontoons when being floated out into
position, and perhaps to help to moor
them there; (2) to control the opening
and closing of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">die/kploos u(po/fausis</foreign>,
which must have been effected by slipping
one or more ships out of position in the
bridge, and replacing the same after the
passage of the craft (unless, indeed, a gap
or quasi-archway was left somewhere, or
in more than one place in the bridge).
Possihly the two pairs of bridges, successively
thrown across the Hellespont,
were not made on the same methods.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the first pair of
bridges, which were destroyed by a
storm, had been made upon the latter
principle, and that the eables really
played a more important <foreign rend="ital">rôle</foreign> in relation
to the first than in relation to the second

bridges may have been constructed more
upon the lines of the ‘Roman’ method
(which may have been ‘Greek’ before
it was Roman), and the cables used
simply or mainly to form the basis, or
to bind together the roadway; the
change in method being underestimated
and misconceived by Hdt., who makes
it merely a matter of a different distribution
and perhaps number of sparto
and byblos ropes. Hdt., who gives no
precise account of the structure or
appearance of the first pair of bridges,
had to rely upon mere hearsay for his
account, and might easily have got
details of the last bridges mixed up
with details from earlier structures, not
merely on the Hellespont, but on
Bosporos and Istros; cp. Introduction,
§ 10. The fact that he describes the
bridges of Xerxes but not the bridges
of Dareios supports the theory of the

‘The disappearance of the sun from his

in terms of motion. Hdt. is of course
aware of the (apparent) motions of the
sun, diurnal and annual (cp 2 24-25);
it is not to be supposed that the motion
here posited is in a visible direction
analogous to either of those: it is apparently
a direct retreat, or evanishment,
from a cloudless and clear sky. There
was no eclipse of the sun visible in Sardes
in the spring of 480 B.C., and this reported
eclipse not only conflicts with the
general chronology of the war, but with
the verifiable eclipse, Oct. 2, 480 B.C., 9.
10 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> It is therefore a fiction, not
merely generslly discreditable to the
traditions of the war, but specifically
ominous to the anecdote of Pythios, his
fright, and its consequences. There
was, indeed, a total eclipse of the sun
on April 18, 481 visible in the Indian
Ocean, but not apparently on the mainland,
or we might (with Rawlinson)
associate with an eclipse the departure
of Xerxes from Susa (which would not
help us out here). An annular eclipse
on Feb. 16, 478 was visible in Sardes,
and might be associated with the king's
presence there, but only after his return
from Greece: this eclipse has perhaps
been transposed by tradition to do duty
at a point where it is most effective.
(That there had been any development
of such feeling since the celebrated
eclipse of Thales and its notorious
results. 1. 74 (Stein), is surely more than
we need suppose.)</p></div>

Behind the physical difficulty lies the
obviously fabulous moral of the story,
as an exhibition of the unbounded cruelty
and caprice of the oriental despot, from
whose rule Hellas had been saved at
Salamis. Beyond that comes the dramatic
or literary interest of the contrast
between the beginning and the end of
Pythios' dealings with Xerxes. The
form and expression of the whole story
are essentially Greek, and the parallel
in 4. 84 (Dareios and Oiobazos) discounts
it. Yet we may reasonably hesitate to
dismiss the story of Pythios as a pure
fabrication. The apparently unconscious
precision of some of the details; Pythios'
name and antecedents; Kritalla the place
of meeting, as Sardes of parting, convey
touches of verisimilitude to a story, or
pair of stories, which has assuredly
‘lost nothing in the telling.’ We may
discount but we cannot deny the evidences
of autocratic caprice, cruelty
and folly, recorded of Xerxes, as of
Kambyses, of the Greek ‘tyrants,’ of
the ‘Roman Caesars’—not to speak of
modern examples from further east or
nearer home. The possession of autocratic
or almost autocratic powers over
fellowmen is more than any human
being can stand without disaster; and
when those powers have been acquired,
not by ability and service (as in the
case of Dareios), but by way of inheritance
and traditional right (as by Xerxes,
or Kambyses), the prospects of disaster
are increased. Such is the unanimous
testimony of Greek tradition in regard
to the second generation of ‘tyrants’
as compared with the first, or founders;
and whatever the exaggerations of tradition
and the prejudices of republicans,
the general conscience of humanity
justifies in its own forum the ‘tendency’
or moral of the too dramatic or too
edifying natural history of the tyrant.</p></div></div>

the noblest and best, who have ‘apples’
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh=la</foreign>)—presumably of gold—and march

Whether the difference in this case
between ‘apples’ and ‘pomegranates’
is one of kind or of degree, who shall
say! But it is difficult to avoid a
suspicion (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) that there is one chiliad
too many, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) that the two chiliads,
the one before and the one after the

or, as we might say, ‘made (or was
making) its way.’ Three stages, of
widely varying length, are specified in
this chapter. I. Out of Lydia into
Mysia, or from Sardes to the Kaikos.
The route is but vaguely indicated: did
the forces go from Sardes to Smyrna?
or by a more northerly road, down the
Hermos valley? or by a still more
northerly route such as afterwards led
from Pergamum to Sardes? or a part
by one, a part by another way? Whatever
the route, this stage would have
occupied not less than five to six days.
II. From the Kaikos, through Atarneus,
to the city of Karene, leaving Mount
Kane on the left hand. The route is
here clearly given; the distance would
only be some twenty R. miles, perhaps
a march of two days. III. From Karene
into the Troad, and Ilion, a march of
several days. The route is indicated,
but is not free from obscurity; there is
difficulty, for example, in understanding
how the column could leave Ida on the
left hand if it marched <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Antandros.
Is ‘left’ a slip for ‘right’? Or is the
point of view not that of the column
<foreign rend="ital">en route</foreign> but of a reporter farther north,
e.g. at Abydos? Or did a part of the
foree really cut across inland, while the
main part took the coast route (as
Blakesley suggested)? Anyway, from
Karene to Adramyttion would be a
long day's march; from Adramyttion
to Antandros another; from Antandros
to Ilion would take at least three days
more. Xenophon and his remnant made
this very march in the opposite direction:

from Edremit (Adramyttion) would
leave the bulk of Ida on the right, not
on the left. A road passing east of Ida,
from Zeitunlii, apparently exists (Sitzler
in Bursian's <title>Jahresb.</title> 86. 67 f.). It is
possible that all three routes were used
by the king's forces; the coast road,
however, must have been taken by the

of Thebe (Hirschfeld in Pauly-Wissowa,

on a hill by the sea, S. of the Euenos.’
Hdt. is the first extant author to name
the city. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.1">Thuc. 5. 1</bibl> mentions it as a
place of refuge offered by the Persian
Pharnakes for some of the Delians expelled
by the Athenians in 422 B.C., and
later (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.108.4">8. 108. 4</bibl>) records the treacherous
butchery of the refugees by the Persian
Arsakes. Xenophon touched the place
(<bibl n="Xen. Anab. 7.8.8"><title>Anab.</title> 7. 8. 8</bibl> quoted above). The city
had a harbour (Paul sailed in a ship of
Adramyttion, Acts 27. 2); and notwithstanding
its sufferings in the Asiatic
wars retained its importance in the times

of Cicero, Strabo, and Pliny (<bibl n="Cic. Flac. 68">Cic. <foreign rend="ital">pro

made Sadyattes his father (Nicol. Damas.

(perhaps in the interests of the ‘Athenian
colony’?) in a distinctly Hellenising
version. Radet (<title>La Lydie,</title> p. 199) treats
Adramys as an historical person, and
dates the foundation 584 B.C. (‘Adramys,’
like Attalos, Atys, Adrastos, has a suspiciously

would not have been at all likely to
worship foreign deities is refuted by
what we know of the Persian policy in
Babylon, in Egypt, and even, from
Hdt.'s testimony, in Greece; cp. Persian
indignation for the destruction of Kybele's
temple, 5. 102; Datis' offerings at Delos,

evidences (<title>Records of the Past,</title> x. pp.

have been the expression of policy, how
far of personal piety, need hardly be
discussed; the two are not mutually
exclusive. It is undoubtedly remarkable
that the Magi should have propitiated
the ‘Heroes,’ ‘hero-worship’ being a
characteristically Hellenic office. Hdt.

altered his opinion. There follows here
an elaborate Dialogue, with five speeches
assigned to each interlocutor (cc. 46-52).
Little or no degree of authenticity can
be claimed for the passage as a record
of an actual conversation between the
king and his uncle. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) The conversation
is <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> a private one; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>)
surely not conducted, although reported,
in Greek; (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) marked by Greek sen timent
rather than Persian, or Oriental; (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>)
affording an artificial antithesis, or
series of antitheses, between the cheery
optimism of the king and the sober
pessimism of the counsellor; (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>) in regard
to human life generally and the jealousy
of the gods; (<foreign rend="ital">f</foreign>) in regard to the natural
difficulties encompassing the expedition;
(<foreign rend="ital">g</foreign>) in regard to the danger to be apprehended
from the Ionians, a human
element of weakness. The passage
suggests to some extent a rationale for
the coming failure of the undertaking,
in ‘the jealousy’ of heaven, the physical
obstacles on land and sea, the humau
elements of weakness in the composition
of the forces, all points which are subsequently
worked out more fully, and
to a great extent in similar dramatic
form. (Cp. cc. 101 ff.) It cannot be
said that Xerxes has the worst of the
argument upon this occasion; he contrasts
favourably with the bl&lt;*&gt;tant egotism
of a Kroisos in his interview with Solon
(1. 30), and Hdt. has nowhere shown
himself a finer literary artist than in
his management of this matter, and of
the subsequent dialogues which are the
vehicles for his own philosophy of
history, with especial reference to the
great expedition. A modern historian,
dealing with a similar problem, must
speak  <foreign rend="ital">in propria persona,</foreign> and dare not
invoke Hdt.'s stage-devices (cp. H. B.
George, <title>Napoleon's Invasion of Russia,</title>
1899, <foreign rend="ital">passim</foreign>). But Hermogenes went
too far in his commendation of Hdt. as
a master in the representation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/qh</foreign>

that of the <foreign rend="ital">protasis,</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the phrase is

Attic prose, is very common in Hdt.
Sitzler (<foreign rend="ital">in l.</foreign>) formulates the rule: “Hdt.

person, and for the third person <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(</foreign> and
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos</foreign> in conjunction with <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> at the opening

(Vordersatz), in order to emphasize an

only, however, in cases where the <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">in
apodosi</foreign> repeats a <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> in the protasis
epanaleptically, or (as in this place) an
opposition of ideas (ein begrifflicher

112) expresses the rule more happily:
“Like Homer, Hdt. is apt after conditional,
temporal, and relative <foreign rend="ital">protaseis</foreign>
(Vordersatze) to impart an emphasis to
the apodosis, and to contrast it with
the <foreign rend="ital">protasis,</foreign> even in cases of an imperative,
by putting its subject forward with
<foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign> even when both sentences have the
same subject.’ A cognate idiom obtains
when Hdt., in antithetical sentences
introduced by <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/n</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">de/</foreign>, in order to
emphasize further the contrast, introduces
the pronoun or grammatical
subject of the second clause, even where

Artabanos anticipates the appeals of
Themistocles, 8. 22 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> and might
have learnt his political philosophy
from the loyal Phoenicians, 3. 19 (<foreign rend="ital">vice

any Persian should have admitted the
‘justice’ of the Ionians in joining the
Greeks; but it is, of course, more than
possible that the loyalty of his Greek

suspected by Xerxes or his councillors;

‘but now, before crossing, let us make
supplication to the gods, who have us
Persians in their charge.’ There is no
monotheism here (nor were the Persians
of that age monotheists), nor even quite
‘Katheno-theism’ or ‘Heno-theism’
(to use F. Max Muller's term, <title>Hibbert
Lectures,</title> 1878, 260). “It is questionable
whether the Persians had the notion
ascribed to them in this place of a special
superintendence of different countries
&lt;nations?&gt; by distinct deities” (Rawlinson).
The verb no doubt implies a
whilome partition; and the idea is undoubtedly
Greek; so Homeric Poseidon
<pb n="75"/>
describes the triple division of the universe
between Zeus, Hades, and himself:
<bibl n="Hom. Il. 15.187"><title>Il.</title> 15. 187</bibl> ff. <foreign xml:lang="greek">trixqa\ de\ pa/nta de/dastai,
e(/kastos d' e)/mmore timh=s ktl.</foreign>, the division
here, however, holds not of nations, but
of natural realms—Sky, Sea, and Underworld,
Earth being common property.
But the struggle of Poseidon and Athene
<foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ th=s xw/rhs</foreign> was the fnndamental
myth of Athens (cp. 8. 55), and the
localization of deities was everywhere
in order in Hellas (cp. <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 2.74.2">Thuc. 2. 74. 2</bibl>
<quote xml:lang="greek">qeoi\ o(/soi gh=n th\n *plataii/da e)/xete</quote></cit>), and
loeal titles among the commonest. The
tribal and the national gods are thoroughly
Hellenic institutions (cp. 1. 143, 144,
147, 148, 5. 49, etc.).</p>
<p>It is hardly reasonable to deny similar
institutions and ideas to the other
peoples and nations of antiquity; rather
may it be said that the appropriation
of gods to the nations, and of the nations
to gods, is charaeteristic of antiqnity
(4. 59, 79, 94 <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de/na a)/llon qeo\n nomi/zontes
ei)=nai ei) mh\ to\n sfe/teron</foreign>, 5. 7, etc.).
In the time of Hdt. this exclusiveness
had been breaking down for a long time,
and Greeks tended to identify their own
deities with the gods of the surrounding
nations, while foreign potentates and
others, from policy or from piety, recognised
and worshipped Greek deities.
These phenomena were parts of the
development of monotheism, a process
the consummation of which was then
still in a remote future; while, conversely,
the essence of polytheism is
involved in the local and tribal appropriation
of deities (deity). The Persians
were apparently qnite ready to recognize
the gods of the nations (Kyros in Babylon,
Kambyses in Egypt, Dareios and Xerxes;
cp. c. 43 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), but they still had their
own especial gods (1. 131, 3. 76), and
even the ruling house, or horde, its
special patron deities (3. 65, 5. 106).
The supposed iconoclastic monotheism
of the Behistun Inscription is refuted,
not merely by other Achaimenid inscriptions,
bnt by the very context of
Behistun.</p></div></div>

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">tei=xos</foreign>, castellum, <foreign rend="ital">passim</foreign>; cp. Livy 31.

that Doriskos had been garrisoned by
Dareios <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)c e)kei/nou tou= xro/nou e)pei/te e)pi\
*sku/qas e)strateu/eto</foreign>, it is remarkable that
nothing is said of the event in Bk. 4.
Seeing that Dareios entered Thrace by
the Bosporos, Stein infers that Dareios
garrisoned Doriskos on the return march
(when he recrossed at the Hellespont).
But had Dareios in person anything to
say to it? Doriskos may have been
occupied by Megabazos, in connexion
with the first conquest of Thrace; though
even this modification is hardly consistent
with the notice of Doriskos, 5.
98, as the place where the fugitive
Paionians were landed by the Lesbians
after the outbreak of the Ionian revolt.
Doriskos is not altogether a suitable
landing-place for the Paionians on that
occasion (cp. my note to 5. 98); but in
any case it can hardly have remained
in the hands of the Persians throughout
the Ionian revolt, but may have been
one of the places occupied, or recovered,
by Mardomos in 492 B.C., though nothing
is said of that in 6. 43-47. Only at
that date, perhaps, was the spot definitely
garrisoned by the Persians. Mardonios
would know it well. The bearing of this
passage upon the problem of composition
is important. It is <foreign rend="ital">prima facie</foreign> older
than 5. 98 (where the site of Doriskos
is taken for granted), and it is easier to
explain the record here and the silence
in Bk. 4 upon the hypothesis that
this is the earher passage, in composition,
than <foreign rend="ital">vice versa.</foreign> Cp. Introduction, § 7.</p></div>

review and reorganization of the forces

desperate delay (contradicted, however,

hardly have any historical justification

siderable portion of the terrestrial and

in the first instance (cp. <bibl n="Diod. 11.3.6">Diodor.

whole fleet of Xerxes into the Hellespont:
it is unnecessary to take the
whole army across the bridge: (were the
missing ten thousand Persian cavalry
shipped direct to Doriskos? cp. c. 54).
If, however, Doriskos was the first place
at which the entire forces for the invasion
of Hellas were concentrated, then
a review, an organization, becomes
both natural and necessary. Mardonios,
among others, might have devised this

‘The enumeration was aceomplished by
the following method.’ Ten thousand
human beings were squeezed into one
spot as tightly as possible: a line was
then drawn round them, and they were
allowed to disperse: a wall, some 3-4
ft. high was then built all round upon
the line: the enclosure, or sheep-fold,
thus construeted, was then filled and
emptied, by snccessive batehes of fighting-men,
one hundred and seventy times:
this was the means by whieh it was
ascertained that the Infantry in the
army amounted to 1,700,000 (or 10,000
x 170).</p>
<p>This story is incredible, and even
absurd, for the following reasons:—</p>
<p>(i.) The method of numbering as
deseribed wonld have taken a very long
time; weeks or months would have
elapsed before 1,700,000 men could have
been marched up, passed through the
enclosnre, and marched away again.
Hdt. deals with myriads of men as if
they were handfuls, and ignores conditions
of time and spaee.</p>
<p>(ii.) The numbers of the eavalry
(80,000) are afterwards given c. 87.
How were these nnmbers aseertained,
for they are not included by Hdt. in
the 170 myriads?</p>
<p>(iii.) The numbers of the Persian forces
are already known, and have been stated
twice. both for infantry and cavalry,
ec. 40, 54 f.: yet the infantry is here
included in the 170 myriads. and snbjeeted
to the proeess of enumeration
described!</p>
<p>(iv.) The process deseribed is not
merely on the faee of it childish but
was donbtless superfluous: the numbers
of each eontingent were no donbt
nominally and approximately known to
the captains, divisional offieers, and
commanders: reports furnished by them
wonld have supplied data for a computation.</p>
<p>(v.)
Elsewhere Hdt. gives the sum
total of large Persian armies, notably
4. 87 (forces of Dareios in the Skythie
campaign), without any explanation of
how the figures had been ascertained in
the first instance.</p>
<p>(vi.) The eredibility of Hdt.'s account
here is not enhaneed by the faet that
the worthless Curtius (<bibl n="Curt. 3.2.2">3. 2. 2</bibl>) makes
‘Dareus’ (Codomannus) employ a similar
device for aseertaining the number of
his host. Whatever the exaggerations
of the <title>Sach-kritik,</title> or ‘real’ criticism,
there are cases where its verdict is final,
and this is one of them; the historian
or critic who maintains the literal eredibility
of this Herodotean absurdity is
past praying for. Nor will any reduction
of the figures save the method of
numbering as deseribed; the smaller
the sum the less need for sueh clumsy
methods: moreover the 170 must be
regarded as the most certain item in
the story. An origin and a rationale
the story must, of course, have had,
however diffieult to discover. The
figures 100, 1000, 10,000 were doubtless
real units of organization in the land
forees of the great king: if Doriskos
was the rendezvous of a great part of
the forees, and the first place where
the whole army and navy were coneentrated,
it is probable enough that
there was some need for organization
or reorganization here: for one thing,
the three army corps, the three marehing
columns were doubtless here formed:
for another, it is possible that at
Doriskos Persian eommanders (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rxontes</foreign>)
were introduced throughout the whole
array, and the grouping of various
contingents under these <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rx&lt;*&gt;tes</foreign> carried
into effeet. See further, &lt;*&gt;pendix II.
§ 5.</p>
<p>One important inference remains to
be drawn from this passage, and the
army-list which follows, as compared
with the data for the army of Dareios
as described in 4. 87, in relation to the
problem of composition. Considering
the materials which Hdt. had at his
disposal for a description of the Host
of Dareios, the <foreign rend="ital">stelai,</foreign> the picture of
Mandrokles, and so on, is it likely that
he would have forgone the opportunity
there presented for a pictorial description
of the Persian forees, unless either this
whole passage had been, so to speak,
already in type, or unless he had a
very clear plan and intention to do for
<pb n="83"/>
Xerxes what he wonld not do for Dareios?
The latter alternative is improbable.
The occnrrence of this passage in Bk.

none of which by itself is conclnsive

very heavy, of the earlier composition

The ‘Kephenes’ are here not in very
good company. Andromeda is the
daughter of Kepheus (c. 150 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), and
the ‘Kephenes’ are no doubt (as with
<bibl n="Ov. Met. 5.1">Ovid, <title>Metamorph.</title> 5. 1</bibl>, <bibl n="Ov. Met. 5.97">97</bibl>) the followers
of Kepheus (or Kepheus is eponym of
the Kephenes, irregularly, for why not
Kepheioi, or Kephen?). Further items
in the mythical pedigree are set forth
c. 150 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> 6. 53, 54 (cp. my notes
<foreign rend="ital">ad ll.</foreign>) and 1. 7. The pedigree here
assumed does not, however, expressly
contradict that in 1. 7 (as Stein suggests)
but rather that in 6. 53. Rawlinson
can discern “no ray of truth in the
fables respecting Perseus”; Blakesley
observes that Hdt. is here drawing “not
from Persian but from Greek sources”
(Hekataios? cp. Introduction, § 10).
Stein well explains all Hdt. means as
being that the Kephenes known to old
Greek story are to be identified with the
people now known as Persians. Kepheus,
however, certainly does not represent
‘Assyria’ (Ninos) any more than Babylonia
(Belos): but why not the primitive,
pre-Phoenician inhabitants of Canaan?

The equipment of the Elamites differed
from that of the Medes and Persians in
but one respect; instead of the (Median?)
<foreign rend="ital">fez</foreign> they wore a (Babylonian?), ‘fillet’ or
head-band. Is not this the head-dress
of the guards upon the Susan frieze,
verily, a bit of local colour! (Cp.
Maspero, iii. 516.) A <foreign xml:lang="greek">mi/tra</foreign> is worn by
the Kypriote princes, c. 90 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> as by

of effeminacy; ep. <bibl n="Aristoph. Thes. 898">Aristoph. <title>Thesm.</title> 898</bibl>.

Rennell (i. 401) regards these Ethiopians

and other provinces in that quarter,’ i.e.
the south-east of the empire; and this
view is endorsed by Rawlinson and
others. The term ‘Burnt-faces,’ Brunetti,
or ‘Blacks’ is of course a mere
epithet, and Hdt. distinguishes the
Ethiopians of Asia and of Africa ethnologically.
This distinction reappears
nowadays in the division of <title>Homo

Some great confusion underlies its employment,

and the country up to the Halys. (Cp.
Hdt. IV.-VI., Appendix XIII.) Since
writing <foreign rend="ital">l. cit.</foreign> it has occurred to me that
in the word we have a sobriquet of the
Medes, <title>Mada,</title> whose empire had extended
mainly over the parts in connexion with
which the term is used. The name has
come to Hdt. from Hekataios; cp.
Steph. B. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*mo/sxoi: *ko/lxwn e)/qnos prosexe\s

however, have been some folk in eastern
Anatolia whose name was confused with
Mada: the Matieni of Hdt., so far as
they stand for a real people, must be
located in that quarter. As Rawlinson
(iv.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> 228 n.) well observes, the “Matieni”
of the later geographers are merely
“book-knowledge” not “real geography
of their day.” Steph B. mentions

be ultimately European.) Hdt. 8, 138
finds Midas at home in Makedonia, which
squares perfectly with his view of ‘the
Phrygian migration.’ The older commentators
and historians, however,
(Blakesley, Rawlinson, Stein), partly
under the influence of ‘the oriental
mirage’ have followed Giseke, <title>ThrakischPelasg.
Stàmme</title>, and reversed the direction
of the migration so far as they
recognized it at all. Baehr (with his
great respect for Hdt.) struck a middle
course; the ‘Phrygians’ were at home in
Asia, but Europeans may have come and
coalesced with native Phrygians. That
there were ‘Thracians’ in Asia (cp. c.
75 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) has always been admitted, and
that Hdt. is right in representing the
Phrygians as Thracians, or at least as
immigrants from Thrace, is now the
better established view, supported (i.)
by the earlier tradition; (ii.) by geographical
considerations (e.g. relation of
Europe and Asia. wedge-like appeaiance
of historic Phrygia); (iii.) by archaeological
evidence (similarity of Phiygian
and later Trojan pottery, ‘Thracian
tumuli’ in the Troad and Phrygia), and
to some extent (iv.) by linguistic; cp.
Kretschmer, <title>Einleitung</title> c. vii. Hdt.
himself has, however, in regard to the
inhabitants of the Troad, reversed the
<pb n="98"/>
historic process of migration in NW.
Asia Minor, cp. c. 20 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>; for the
Myso-Teukrian invasion of Europe in
that passage must be substituted a
Phrygo-Mysian invasion of Asia Minor
and the Troad. The Mysian invasion of
Europe is indeed hardly consistent with
the Phrygian invasion of Asia; Hdt. is
best reconciled with himself by the
hypothesis above stated.</p></div>

Rawlinson, under the influence of
the oriental mirage (“the stream of
Indo-European colonization (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) having
set westwards”), prefers to derive the
Phrygians from the Armenians. So too
Stein. No special stress need be laid on
the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/poikoi</foreign> (which is too much for
Baehr) beyond the idea that the two
nations are related, and that the Phrygian
is the elder, more primary, and historically
more important. Eudoxos (<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Steph. B. <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)armeni/a</foreign>) supports the
Herodotean opinion: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)arme/nioi de\ to\ me\n

“This statement agrees so well
with the linguistic facts, that there is not
the slightest reason to doubt it” (Kretschmer,
<foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 209), going even so far
as to endorse the connexion between the
Armenians and Thessaly, discovered by
Alexander's Thessalian vassals (Strabo
503. 530). If the Armenians were of
European and Phrygian origin, the
question would still remain whether
they were sent forth by the ‘Phrygians’
before or after the settlement in Asia—
whether they were in fact a swarm, or
colony from historic Pbrygia, or from
prehistoric Thrace? The language of
Hdt. and Eudoxos seems to favour the
former alternative; the historic situation
and probabilities point rather to the
latter. Some have referred the ‘Aryan’
character of Armenia to Iranian, not to
European, antecedents (cp Baumgartner
<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Pauly-Wissowa 2. 1182), and the
meeting of Phrygians and Armenians
might be the meeting of two long
separated columns of ‘Aryans.’ But the
assumption of ethnological purity, corresponding
to language, in a region which
has always been a ‘buffer-state,’ is
perhaps rash. In regard to the name,
there is a difficulty arising from the fact
that the ‘Armenians’ themselves have
never used it. It is some other's name
for them. <title>Haikh</title> is the native name of

or to a town in that district (Hierocl. p.

came up with the rise of the Mermnad

of history were a mixed population, in

The population of ‘Kabalis’ and the
other ‘Pisidian’ communes was probably
of the native Anatolian stock, with
some miscegenation. That one particular
division of them had ‘Kilikian’ armour
sounds a little improbable: but the
reference forward, from the army-list to

For reasons fully set forth in

has here fallen into an error. The
twenty-nine <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rxontes</foreign> just enumerated
are ‘Myriarchs,’ i.e. commanders of
nominal regiments of 10,000 men, which
together with the 10,000 under Hydarnes
imply a nominal force of 300,000. This
force is divided into three columns of
100,000 men, each under two ‘Strategi’
(each commanding 50,000). The Chiliarchs,
Hekatontarchs, and Dekarchs are
all presumably native to the countries,
of which they are leading the contingents.

The adj. <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezou=</foreign> (agreeing with <foreign xml:lang="greek">stratou=</foreign>)

the repetition of the patronymic here, in

Hydarnes, the commander (Myriarch)

is here given a place co-ordinate with

numhering (aecord. to Hdt.), without
the Immortals, 1,690,000, or 281,6662/3

absurd. If Hydarnes and the six
Strategi were on a level, then each of
them commanded 10,000 men, and the
total foot amounted to some 70,000. If
the total army, or infantry, amounted
to 300,000, then Hydarnes' proper place
is with the twenty-nine <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/rxontes</foreign> or
Myriarchs already named, though as
Myriarch of ‘The Immortals’ he may
very well have had a higher brevet

He belongs to the very highest nobility.
His father, Hydarnes, was one of the

Stein takes <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/de</foreign> to refer to the
coming list, on the ground that some of
the previously-named nations could not
furnish cavalry: (which ?): he also notes
the stylistic inconsequence of the tenses,
and once proposed (cp. App. Crit.) to
change <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppeu/ei</foreign> into <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/ppeue</foreign> to harmonise

<p>The <title>Cavalry-list</title> which follows (cc.

names of nations supplying cavalry are
given, but three of these, Arabians
(camels), Libyans (chariots), Indians
(chariots and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ke/lhtes</foreign>) may be removed,
leaving eight nations to furnish 80,000
cavalry. As 12,000 Persians and 8000
Sagartians may be subtracted, six
myriads are left to be supplied by six
nations. One of the names of the six is
doubtful. If Stem's <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pa/ktues</foreign> be adopted,
then the Sagartians are the only folk
supplying cavalry who have not already
been named and described in the infantry-list.
If there were forty-six
nations represented in the infantry, it
seems unlikely that only eight were
represented in the cavalry; and <foreign rend="ital">vice
versa</foreign> if the cavalry-list is good, and eight
to twelve nations furnished that, were
there forty-six supplying infantry?
Stein understands <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppeu/ei tau=ta</foreign> to be
introducing an ideal or potential list,
reduced in <foreign xml:lang="greek">parei/xeto</foreign> to the actual
dimensions on the given occasion. It is
likely enough that both infantry- and
cavalry-lists are rather ideals of the

furnish soldiers than an authentic list of

Those passages look like later information,

Book is of earlier composition. The
Sagartians appear to be a <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/nos</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/qnos</foreign>

the south-Iranian region. Yet one of
the rebellions quelled by Dareios was
headed by a Sagartian named Sitratachmes,
who set up as “the King of
Sagartia,” and claimed descent from
Kyaxares (Behistun Inscrip. iii. 14),

The use of the lasso, which we are apt

Sauromatae by Pausanias, 1. 21. 8, and
is even found represented on the Assyrian

The lasso was not then a peculiarity of the
‘Sagartians,’ nor is it likely that their
lasso was peculiar as formed of plaited
thongs. The description given by Hdt.
in the present of the manner in which
the lasso was used is clear enough, but
it is remarkable that no instance of its
employment is recorded during the campaign.

(i.) Other ancient authorities give different

The fleet was piobably commandeered
in round numbers, in ‘decads,’ in
hundreds—perhaps a ‘chiliad’ was the
regulative total; no other Persian fleet
ever appears with a nominal total expressed
by an uneven figure. (iii.)
Aischylos, far from supporting Hdt.'s

figure is for Salamis, Hdt.'s for Doriskos,
and (2) Hdt.'s figure may have been
reached by misunderstanding Aischylos,

Peloponnesian settlements in Kypros

<div type="commline" n="7">

older tban the ‘Greek’ or so-called

two elements bostile. Kition and Amatbûs
(5. 105) were tbe Phoenician headquarters.
The different attitude of
the Persians towards Pboenicians and
Ionians, and the results of tbe Ionian
revolt (498-494 B.C.), especiallyin Kypros,
had accentuated tbe difference between
tbe Greek and the Semitic elements in
the island at the time when Hdt. was

‘Libyan’ or ‘Asiatic’ Hdt. does not
indicate, and such au element tbere
probably was in the island (cp. case of
Kolchis c. 79 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); but the really
primitive stock, belonging to the ‘Anatolian’
race, is completely ignored by
Hdt., unless we are to suppose tbat it is
here misrepresented.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s au)toi\ *ku/prioi le)gousi</lem></app>: the
citation of tbe autbority, or source

an indication of doubt. Tbe doubt is
presumably limited to tbe last item, the
existence of an ‘Ethiopian’ element in
tbe population. By <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toi\ *ku/prioi</foreign> we
cannot here understand tbe primitive or
autocbthonous stratum, as distinguisbed
from Hellenic, Pboenician, or Ethiopian
elements, but simply ‘dwellers in
Kypros’—without etbnic distinction—
‘Kyprian autborities.’</p>
<p>In 5. 113 Hdt. implies a similar
doubt as to tbe ‘Argive’ origin of the

in a compressed form: there is
not mucb to sbow whicb passage is of
earlier composition, except the omission

Introduction, § 8.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*termi/lai <gap/> e)k *krh/ths</lem></app>. The
Kretan origin of tbe Termilai, or Tramilai,
seems less probable than tbe hypotbesis
that tbey represented the indigenous
population of tbe Anatolian main, and
were in so far allied to tbe Karians,
Lydians and other native stocks. Yet
it would be bold to deny a connexion
between early Krete and the Asianic
side: and the ‘Eteokretes’ tbemselves
<pb n="117"/>
may perhaps bave been akin to the
fundamental or indigenous population of
Asia Minor. In 1. 171 tbe Karians, too,
are derived by Hdt. from Krete in the
teeth of their own behef, duly reported,
that made tbem <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)to/xqonas h)peirw/tas</foreign>.
The decipherment of the Lykian inscriptions
(<title>Tituli Asiae Minoris</title>: vol. i.
<title>Tituli Lyciae,</title> ed. E. Kalinka, Vienna,
1901) may throw ligbt upon the etbnological
problem: it is at least clear
that tbe Tramilai were not Greeks.
The poet of tbe <title>Iliad</title> is acquainted with
Lykia and the Lykians tbough not witb
Tramilai: (notably 6. 168 ff. story of
Bellerophontes, cp. also story of Pandaros:
4. 86 ff.); and long before the
days of Homer the Lykians (Lukki,
Lnka) figure in the Tel-el-Amarna
letters and on Egyptian monuments of
the Ramessid period: cp. Hall, <title>Oldest
Civilisation,</title> p. 88. ‘Lykians’ and
‘Termilai’ might be two names (Greck
and Native) for one and tbe same people,
or more probably (as ‘Termilai’ figures in
Greek) represent two elements in the
population of historic Lykia, the native
and the foreign (Hellenic, or Hellenized).
The presence of an Hellenic element is
asserted in the eponymous hero's derivation
from Athens. It is by no means
impossible that tbe primitive, or
‘Mykenaian’ inhabitants of Attika had
relations with Lykia as with Ionia and
Kypros; but ‘Lykos son of Pandion’
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) is scarcely an historical person, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>)
owes his position in the legend of
‘Lykia’ to the nominal correspondence.
<bibl n="Paus. 1.19.4">Pausan. 1. 19. 4</bibl> connects the name with
the Lukeion (Lycaeum) in Atbens, which
may bave been in fact the temenos of

<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n toi=si prw/toisi tw=n lo/gwn</lem></app>: tbe
reference is clearly to Bk. 1 c. 171,
where two views in regard to the origin of
the Karians are reported (cp. c. 92 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>).
Tbe reference and the form of reference
here are most remarkable. This is
a bsolutely the first reference to an earlier
Book which occurs in this section of tbe
work, notwitbstanding tbe fiequent
occasions for such references hitberto.
To the form of reference there is but one
precise parallel in tbe whole work, viz.
5. 36 <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s dedh/lwtai/ moi e)n tw=| prw/tw| tw=n
lo/gwn</foreign>, i.e. 1. 92. Cp. my note <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign> The
reference tbere is to the first half of the
first Book (as we bave it): the reference
here is to tbe second half of the first Book
(bence, perbaps, the use of the plural).
Nowbere else does Hdt. refer back in
this fasbion either to the ‘first’ or to
any other set of ‘Logi.’ Tbe question
obviously presents itself, whether tbe
reference is a gloss, or wbether it is
from tbe autbor's band, and if so,
whetber it is an addition or belongs to
the first draft of his work. The problem
<pb n="118"/>
here is far more acute than in 5. 36, for
several reasons. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) The ‘fifth’ Book
may very well have been composed, or
redacted, after tbe ‘first’ on any
theory of composition, but this reference
here seems to destroy tbe bypotbesis
tbat Bks. 7-9 were the ‘first’ Logi
compiled by Hdt. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Tbe reference in
tbe fiftb Bk. is more easily accounted
for, whether as a gloss, or as an insertion
by the autbor's hand, than tbe
reference bere: because tbroughout the
(army- and) navy-list so far notes on
the <title>Origines</title> or provenience of peoples
and nations have occurred, and one
migbt be expected in tbe case of tbe
Karians, while in the passage of Bk. 5
tbe reference is, so to speak, purely
fortuitous, and not required by tbe
context. If now the reference here is to
be regarded as autbentic and of tbe first
draft, it will follow almost of a certainty
tbat Bk. 1, much as we have it, was in
existence wben Hdt. wrote this passage:
was Bk. 1 tbeu tbe first portion of tbe
work composed by Hdt. and if so, how
much more of tbe work had be composed
before coming to Bk. 7? Tbe hypotbesis
of the priority in a first draft of Bks. 7,
8, 9—for which tbere is so mucb to be
said—need not, however, be surrendered
if this reference, or the wbole context in
wbicb it occurs (army- and navy-lists),
can be regarded as belonging to the
second or tbird draft of this Book, or
even as considerably touched up and
revised by tbe author in successive
drafts. As Bks. 7, 8, 9, even if the
earliest section of tbe work projected and
more or less accomplis bed, have certainly
received additions down to the date of
the Arcbidamian War, it is not obligatory
to atbetize this passage: but tbere
does remain tbe possibility that tbe
words <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=toi...ei)/rhtai</foreign> are a gloss modelled,
perbaps, ou the genuine reference in 5.
36, and occasioned by the glossators
missing a note on tbe origin of tbe
Karians: or the gloss might be contained
simply in tbe words <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n toi=si prw/toisi tw=n

Unfortunately, Hdt. bimself bas not

the fleet under their command consisted
of four district squadrons, or divisions,

only of two. Tbe doubt may also
arise whether tbe arrangements for the

an alogous to those for the army: were

or divisions? In tbat case Hdt.'s list
of the admirals is incomplete, though
bis sources for tbe naval department
are generally superior to his sources for
the army. Or were there only tbree

c. 88, and bave we in tbe four

as we should there have had, had tbe

really only in two divisions under tbe

two Achaimenid admirals, each division
being named from its head or leading contingent,
A. Ionio-Karian, B. Egyptian:
the confusion in the text might favour
this hypothesis, but the weight of argument
is against it. 1. <foreign xml:lang="greek">stratih/</foreign> should
mean rather a fighting unit than transports.
2. It is not likely that the
Phoenicians, who furnish 300 ships,
were simply grouped under either the
Egyptian or the Ionio-Karian division.
3. The generalanalogies and probabilities,
and to some extent the subsequent narrative
of the naval operations, favour the
view that the principle of tripartition
underlay the naval organization in the
campaign. The other <foreign xml:lang="greek">stratih/</foreign> here then
is probably the Phoenician (300), with
which, if the whole fleet amounted to
1207, the Kilikian (100) may have
been combined, under the command of
Prexaspes and Megabazos, either as
colleagues, or in succession. The
Egyptian ( + Kypros + Lykia) would
furnish a nominal 400, and the IonioKarian
with all the rest would account
for 407. If each squadron amounted,
even nominally, to 400, it seems probable
that there would be two admirals
in command of each (commanding 200
apiece); in which case the (suboidinate)
colleagues of Aehaimenes and Ariabignes
have been forgotten.</p></div>

the suspicion that the so-called

Arados, like Tyre and Sidon situate on

destined in later times to eclipse Tyre
itself (cp. Strabo <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) Merbalos resembles
the Carthaginian Maharbal

the name of the Phoenician deity.</p>

Syennesis of Kilikia appears in the year
585 B.C. mediating between Lydians

might be the one here mentioned, as
about contemporary with the Ionian

Syennesis of Kilikia in 401 B.C. (<title>Hell.</title>
3. 1, 1, cf. <title>Anab.</title> 1. 2. 12-27). The

<p>Oromedon appears as a name or epithet
in some MSS. of Theokritos 7. 46 (<foreign rend="ital">v.l.</foreign>

Timonax and Timagoras are thorough
Greeks, and must have ruled one of
the Greek states other than Salamis
(perhaps Kurion or Soli? But Aristokypros,
son of Philokypros, was king of
Soli in 496 B.C., 5. 113). Gorgos, the son
of Chersis, is incidentally established as
king of the Salaminians in 8. 11; but
the absence here of any reference back
to the notices of this Hellenized House
given in 4. 163, 5. 104, 113, etc., is still
more remarkable, except on the supposition
that this passage is of earlier
composition, or that Hdt. follows in
various places various sources so slavishly
as to surrender his rights of combination,

Chersis also may pass for
Greek. He had at least three sons
(Onesilos, 5. 104, Gorgos, Philaon, 8. 11),
and was himself the son of a Siromos
(cp. 1. 3 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) and grandson of Evelthon

that Halikarnassos had been excluded
from the Dorian amphiktiony, 1. 144,
yet ‘Kos is subject to the excommunicated
eity.’ This would be an interesting
example of the separation of Church
and State in early times; but is it
certain that the episode in 1. 144 is
prior to 480 B.C.?</p></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pa=n e)o\n *dwriko/n</lem></app> Hdt. will not
allow any impurity or miscegenation in
the population of the Dorian Hexapolis;
it all goes back to the Dorians of the
Argolid, the Halikarnassians to Dorian
Troizen, the rest (i.e. Kos, Nisyros,
Kalymnos, or Kalymna, or Kalymnai)
to Dorian Epidauros.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the purely Dorian
character of these settlements—as indeed
of the remaining Dorians both within
and without the Hexapolis (cp. c. 93
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> and 1. 144)—is anything but indisputable.
(1) That the Dorian invaders
of the Peloponnesos could have spared
sufficient drafts to colonize SW. Asia
Minor is on the face of it improbable.
(2) Nor is the purely Dorian character
of the Peloponnesian Dorians itself to
be admitted: apart from the question
of intermarriage, many passed for Dorians,
as others for Achaeans, who had little
right to the name. (3) The Homeric
catalogue makes Kos (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.677"><title>Il.</title> 2. 677</bibl>) Hellenic
before the Trojan War, as also Lindos
(656), Karpathos (676), Syme (671), etc.
Rawlinson regards all that as anachronism,
so likewise the prae-Dorian date assigned
by some authorities to the colonisation
of Halikarnassos (cp. St&lt;*&gt;abo 543, 939,
Steph. B.  <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign>); but we must now be
prepared to recognize that ‘Peloponnesians’
and others passed freely across
the Aegean long before the days of the
Return of the Herakleids. There are
two possibilities to be reckoned with:
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) The ‘Dorians’ were a much earlier
and more primitive element in the
Aegean population than the legend of
the ‘Return’ recognizes; or (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>), as is
more probable, the ‘Dorian’ colonization
in Asia was merely an <title>Epoikism,</title>
the Dorian element small and nominal,
confined at first perhaps to the leaders,
or new <foreign rend="ital">oikists</foreign>; cp. story of Dorieus,
5. 42 ff. That it was, however, a real
presence is proved by the appearance
of the Dorian tribes in Halikarnassos,
Kalymna, Kos (though late?); cp.
Hermann-Thumser, i. 110. How factitious,
‘pragmatic,’ or <foreign rend="ital">tendenzios</foreign> such
legends may be is illustrated by the
stories of Thera and Kyrene; see Hdt.

first suggested that Hdt. had personal
access to the documents drawn up on
this occasion (<title>Asiatic Nations,</title> i. 441,
E T.): Heeren's idea was approved by
Thirlwall. Rawlinson sees, in “the
minuteness of description” a “proof
<pb n="128"/>
positive that the foundation of the whole
is not desultory inquiry but a document.”
(There is a mean between ‘desultory
inquiry’ and ‘a document’; also, there
are documents and documents.) Grote
(against Heeren and Thirlwall) put
down Hdt.'s information to “the Greeks
who accompanied the expedition.”
Trautwein has combined this view with
the documental idea in his discovery of
‘The Memoirs of Dikaios.’ That royal
army- and navy-lists, and of these forces,
existed, or had existed in Hdt.'s time,
we may well believe; but that they
were first drawn up at Doriskos, or in
the manner described, is not probable;
they may, however, have been in use
there, for purposes of review, muster,
and verification. They are not likely to
have contained the multifarious knowledge
exhibited in the Herodotean lists;
and as they would presumably have
been written in Persian, Hdt. could
hardly have made use of them at first

Hdt. however (for it is, of course, Hdt.
speaking), rather mixes his metaphors,
and obscures his argument, as in other
cases (cp. cc. 152, 162 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). If poverty
is indigenous (<foreign xml:lang="greek">su/ntrofos</foreign>), how is it to
be ‘warded off,’ like the ontlandish
‘tyranny’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">desposu/nh</foreign>)? To cease to be
poor is to invite attack. This was the
moral of the Lykurgean institutions
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">sofi/h, no/mos i)sxuro/s</foreign>), which no doubt
produced manly valour (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)reth/, e)/paktos</foreign>),
but aimed not at banishing but at
nursing its elementary conditions. Historically,
indeed (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)ei) kote</foreign>), the time had
been when the wealth of ‘gold Mykenai’
attracted the poor but well-armed invaders.
That is a point Hdt. forgets.
But there was something paradoxical, no
donbt, in the wealthy and ill-armed
Asiatics swarming to the invasion of
hard - headed, hard - handed Hellas (for
which moral cp. further 9 80-82). The
bearing of the Mykenaian finds on the

appears to take <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ nu=n ta/de</foreign> as one

Even so <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/de e)storgw\s e)kei/nous de\ mise/wn</foreign>

<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/de me\n e\storgw\s e)kei/nons de\

still, why should the one verb be in the

recurrence of the verb <foreign xml:lang="greek">ste/rgein</foreign> just below,
where the meaning is hardly disputable,
favours Stein's suggestion: at the same

the most careful compositions, with
different senses at no great intervals (cp.
A. B. Cook, “Unconscious Iterations”

Could <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/de e\storgw\s e)kei/nous</foreign> give a simple
sense by itself? <foreign xml:lang="greek">ste/rgein</foreign> means various

three words are, indeed, somewhat
awkward, as the interval of revolt is
thus taken for granted. But the conquest

fact of the conquest by Megabazos ‘and

been known to Hdt. long before he
could have written out the stories in
Books 5 and 6, the latter of which
represents the expedition of Mardonios
as a failure. Still less is there here any
record of the conquest of Thasos (and
the Peraea), which in Book 6 is treated
as completely independent of, and subsequent
to, the operations of Mardonios.

failure. And in the Catalogue (B 846)
the Kikones are mentioned among the
Thracian allies of Troy, between the
Hellespont and the Axios (or between
the ‘Thrakians and the Paionians’). A
better title to the land they could hardly
have had &lt;*&gt; In Homeric times the name
of the Kikones is recognized as widespread
between Paionia and Hellespont,

naturally lasts on in literature, and even

550-350 B.C. Originally a settlement
from Klazomenai it had been overwhelmed
by the native Thracians
(Bistones?), but was successfully reestablished
by the fugitive Teians in
546 B.C. (Hdt. i. 168). Timesios of
Klazomenai still apparently being accounted

assessed at 15 T. under the Athenian
regime (lowered in 425 B.C. to 10 T.).
Its coinage in the fifth century, like that
of Maroneia and other towns in the
district, is on the Phoenician standard.
Head (p. 219) ascribes this fact to “the
existence in early times on the site of
Abdera of a Phoenician trading-station
or factory.” Might it not rather be
connected with the Persian supremacy
in Thrace and Makedon from 512-478
B.C.? Grassberger, however (<title>Gr. Ortsnamen</title>

This is the only appearance of the

to Makedoma, followed by Sitalkes in
429 B.C. Sitalkes may have ‘made’ or
unmade the road; but it was doubtless
an ancient route. The ‘Doberes’ can
hardly rank ethnically with ‘Paionians’
and ‘Paioplai’: Thuc. seems to incorporate
them with the former, Hdt. to
associate them rather with the latter.
The Paionians and Paioplai are found
assoeiated together in 5. 15—a passage
of later composition than this one apparently,
and supplying, <foreign rend="ital">inter alia,</foreign> evidence

of the existence of two roads into Paionia,

In this place the Paionians are placed
by Hdt. E. of the Strymon, but he
apparently conceives them as not lying
on the Persian route. Kretschmer
(<title>Einleitung,</title> p. 246) follows Tomaschek
(<title>Thraker,</title> 1. 13 ff.) in regarding the
Paionians as ultimately not of ‘Thracian’
but of ‘Illyrian’ origin: ‘the name of
the Paioman stock, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*paio/plai</foreign>, has a

is perplexing. The district Phyllis is
bounded, according to Hdt., on the west
side by the Angites, on the south side
by the Strymon, into which the Angites
empties itself. He therefore conceives
the Angites as flowing north and south,
the Strymon as flowing west and east.
The Strymon may be said to flow from
north-west to south-east; the Angites
may perhaps be said to flow from northeast
to south-west, but Hirschfeld
(Pauly-Wissowa i. 2191) quite naturally
describes Hdt. as extending Phyllis
northwards to the Angites, which, moreover,
falls, not into the Strymon, but
into the Lake Kerkinitis. Of the existence
of the latter Hdt. seems ignorant.
It is mentioned in connexion with Alexander's
march in 334 B.C. (Arrian, <title>Anab.</title>
1. 11. 3), and it will probably have been
in existence in 480 B.C., though even
Thuc. (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.98.1">2. 98. 1</bibl>) only mentions <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kerki/nh</foreign>

82, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s to/n</foreign> (relative) goes rather with
<foreign xml:lang="greek">sfa/zontes</foreign> than with the final verb. The
meaning of the word extends beyond
“sacrificing with intent to ascertain the
will of the gods” (Stein); it seems to
carry always the suggestion of obtaining
a favourable sign. The sacrifice of the
horse to a river was a ‘Trojan’ rite; the
animals were thrown in alive: <foreign xml:lang="greek">zwou\s d'
e)n di/nh|si kaqi/ete mw/nuxas i(/ppous</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 21.132"><title>Il.</title> 21.
132</bibl>). Horses were offered to Helios in
Sparta (<bibl n="Paus. 3.20.5">Pausan. 3. 20. 5</bibl>), to Poseidon
in Argos (<bibl n="Paus. 8.7.2">Pausan. 8. 7. 2</bibl>). The horse
was especially a ‘Skythian’ sacrifice (4.
61; cp. my note <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>). The ‘Massagetae’
worship only the sun, and sacrifice
horses thereto, ‘the swiftest creature to
the swiftest god’ (1. 216), while of the
Persians Hdt. expressly asserts that they
not merely sacrifice the horse, but con<pb n="144"/>
sume the costly victim (1. 133); and
Xenophon, <title>Anab.</title> 4. 5. 35, endorses at
least the former statement. A more
recent illnstration of the rite in the same
region (Tacit. <title>Ann.</title> 6. 37) offers a horse
‘placando amni’ (Euphrates). Were ‘the
white horses’ used on this occasion of
the Nesaean breed, cc. 40, 55 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>?
For the actual Persian ritual Rawlinson
well quotes (and translates) Strabo, 732,
3. But if the description holds good
for this earlier period, Hdt. would not
have correctly reported the procedure
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">sfa/zontes e)s to\n potamo/n</foreign>), which is just
what Strabo's Magi will not do.</p></div></div>

its bearing upon the date of composition;
cp. c. 113. The bridge here in question
Hdt. seems to locate at ‘Nine ways’:
it was possibly higher up the river. He
speaks here indeed of ‘Bridges’: perhaps
conceiving one for the Army, and one
for the Train, as at the Hellespont.
Probably several pontoons were thrown
across the Strymon.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">zw/ontas katw/russon. *persiko/n</lem></app>:
perhaps Hdt. was not aware, when he
wrote this passage, that the horrible
human immolation here described was
more in accord with the religion and
custom of the Thracians (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixw/rioi</foreign>) than
with Persian ideas and practices. Cp. 4.
93 (Getae), 63 (Skyths), 72 (<foreign rend="ital">id.</foreign>). Nor
is the argument by which he seeks to
establish the Persian observance of the
practice of ‘live-burial’ conclusive. Even
if the fact was correctly reported, Amestris
in her old age may have been no very
good exponent of the ‘Persian’ religion.
Hdt. here makes no reference to the
perlormance of Kambyses, who on one
occasion, as elsewhere, and probably
afterwards, recorded, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*perse/wn o(moi/ous

katw/ruce</foreign> 3. 35. Amestris was not content
with a dozen: but then, she had a
good reason. Brutal punishments, and
for political offences, were ‘Persian’
enough (cp. Duncker, <title>E. T.</title> vi. 340 f.),
but it is not clear that human sacrifice
was any part of the religion of the
Achaimenidai; and if Amestris (c. 61
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) ever put it in practice as a
religious act, she was conforming to
some primitive and savage revivalism.
Ktesias, indeed, records her to
have tortured Apollonides, a Koan
physician, for two months, and then
had him buried alive on the death of
Amytis; but that was an act of
vengeance for a gross outrage, and
abnse of his position (Ktes. <title>Pers.</title> 42).</p></div>

Artaxerxes himself (425 B.C.), and after
the death of the younger Zopyros; cp.

death, though after his desertion). This
passage then belongs to the very latest
additions by the author to his work,
and may be dated after the outbreak of
the Archidamian War. Cp. Introduction,

what god was that? In Thrace it might
have been Salmoxis (4. 94), in Hellas,
Pluton, or Haides; in Egypt, perhaps,
Osiris: but in Persia? and at this time?
It can hardly be Arimanes (Agria manu),
whom a Persian would not have worshipped,
nor have located thus. Rawlinson
thinks Hdt. here speaks as a Greek.
Stein thinks Amestris' act was a thankoffering
for the great age she had
attained: that can hardly be sound. If
the act was ‘religious’ it was probably
propitiatory: but the religious motive
may be a gloss. The exchange, or

Phya, who personated Athene in 556-5

and Thrace (cp. c. 73 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and
perhaps the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sh=ma *)artaxai/ew</foreign> was one of
these. Unless <title>Persici apparatus</title> were
recovered, one might be sceptical as to
the identity. But we shall do well to
beware of seeing with Wmckler, <title>Geschichtc
Israels</title> ii. (1900) 175, following the
devious steps of Mucke, <foreign rend="ital">vom: hrat
zum Tiber</foreign> (1899), in Artachaites (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) a
mythical figure, or of admitting that
“Atrachaites (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) the dead hero of
Akanthos has a speaking likeness to the
departing year, which was celebrated by
the grand Banquet at the Sakaenfestival.”
The Bauquet here at Akanthos,
by the way, depends on the misinterpretation
of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ceini/h</foreign> above, and is
assumed to be the only meal the king
had on his way to Greece (“an anderen
Orten scheint er also nicht gegessen zu
haben,” <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 177). Artachaies, though
rather tall of stature, loud of voice, is
<pb n="148"/>
as real a man and an Achaimenid as
Xerxes himself.</p></div>

has nothing extraordinary in it,

That a Greek city should have a ‘barbarian’
hero is perhaps less surprising
than that non-Hellenic cities should
worship Greeks. These colonies in
Thrace sit rather lightly to their proper
‘oikists’; cp. the well-known case of
Amphipolis, <bibl n="Thuc. 5.11.1">Thuc. 5. 11. 1</bibl>. Was the

originally perhaps a Greek eolony, but a
Makedonian town at the date when
Hdt. was writing, and doubtless in 480

a few months in 432-31 B.C. (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.61.2">Thucyd.
1. 61. 2</bibl>, 2. 29. 6). Its position and its
harbour must have given it importance
always, but only with the foundation
of Thessalonike on the spot by
Kassandros (Strabo 330. 21) were the
possibilities of the place fully appreciated;
and only with the Romans did
Thessalonike, as the capital of one of
the Makedonian regions, and at the very
middle of the Via Egnatia, reach its full
destiny, albeit thereafter to be supplanted
by Constantinople. It was by no accident
that a Christian church early
flourished here (cp. the two <title>Epp.</title> ascribed

of the Jews, and <title>Saloniki,</title> still the seat

thos (cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">trithmori/s</foreign> c. 131 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), though
Hdt. does not specify it clearly for any
part of the march except that between
Doriskos and Akanthos, and, indeed,
only for this part here as a belated explanation
of a new departure or development
at Akanthos (if it was at Akanthos,
and not at Argilos). But did the
arrangement only date from Doriskos?
The land-forces that marched from
Sardes to Abydos, and from Sestos to
Doriskos, must have had some good
organization, and definite tactical dispositions;
but it is possible that a new
departure, a new devel &lt;*&gt;nt, was
effected at Doriskos, espe&lt;*&gt; if (as I
have ventured to suggest) at &lt;*&gt;east onethird
of the forces reached Doriskos by
sea, with probably the greater portion of
the fleet; cp. notes to cc. 44, 59  <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
It may then have been at Doriskos that
the full tripartition, or rather the triplication,
of the land forces was effected;
and from that point to Akanthos the
army may have marched, on three approximately
parallel routes—left, middle,
and right—by coast-line, inland and
between, the fleet remaining in touch at
least with the left column. Hdt. leaves
no doubt here as to his own conception
of the order of march from Doriskos to
Akanthos; but in his actual narrative
of the march (cc. 108-117), though incidentally
implying the existence of two
distinct marching columns, he is nowhere
betrayed into implying the existence
of a third. Is it possible that after
all there were only two actually on land,
the third <foreign xml:lang="greek">moi=ra</foreign> being conveyed by the
transports and fleet? In that case
Xerxes himself would probably have
marched by the coast route, with a <foreign rend="ital">corps
d'armée</foreign> on his right, on the inland road
(via Krenides, and north of Pangaion),
and the fleet on his left (carrying a large
number of soldiers, perhaps more than a
mere third). Several points confirm this
conjecture. (1) At Akanthos Xerxes
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ph=ke a)p' e(wutou= poreu/esqai ta\s ne/as</foreign>. (2)
There are two routes plainly traceable
from Doriskos to Akanthos, but a third
is not indicated, nor easy to suggest.
(3) The arrangement provides some work
for the immense host of transports,
which may have advanced to Therme.
(4) At least a very large number of
Persians and Medes and Sakai are supposed
to be on the war-ships as <title>Epibatai</title>:
these probably represent men taken from
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezo/s</foreign>, cp. c. 96 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> (5) The
arrangement appears reasonable in itself,
and eases the difficulty of the advance of
the huge forces. (6) If the right column
crossed from Argilos to Therme direct
(cp. c. 115 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and Xerxes with the
middle column reached Akanthos, what
becomes of the left column, unless we
have shipped it somewhere <foreign rend="ital">en route</foreign>?</p></div>

Torone is a ‘Chalkidic’ town (cp. 8.

from the daughter of Pioteus or Poseidon

(Galepsos), Sermyle, Mekyberna, Olynthos,
and it contradicts also the statement
here following, which appears to make
the fleet sweep round &lt;*&gt; east side of
the Pallene peninsula. Rawlinson solves
the difficulty by the supposition that
only a portion of the fleet made the
circuit of the Toronaean gulf: “the
main body of the fleet &lt;*&gt;d across the
mouth of the bay.” &lt;*&gt; does not
make this distinction. Blakesley brings
out the Herodotean inconsequence in
the remark: “It is not conceivable that
the whole fleet should make the circuit
of the Toronaie gulf, and afterwards
return to Point Ampelos in order to cross
it at the narrowest part.” Olynthos
cannot have been visited by the fleet,
for it was not a port: Mekyberna need
not, for it lay on the route of advance
for the army. Hdt. owing to his ignorance
of the exact topography of the

mixed up places visited by the army

(such as would probably have been given

Poteidaia was the richest and most important
city of Chalkidike in the fifth
century, and the rise of its assessment
from 6 to 15 talents in 436 B.C. (cp.
Hill, <title>Sources,</title> p. 77, <title>C.I.A.</title> i. p. 230)

<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ *poteidaiatika/</foreign> (Thuc. 1. 56 ff., though
Thuc. does not say so). In natural

Agesipolis died in it 380 B.C. (Xenoph.

Livy 44. 46 gives a description of it as it
appeared to the eyes of Aemilius Paulus
in 168 B.C.: “Sita est in tnmulo vergente
in occidentem hibernum. Cingunt
paludes inexsuperabilis altitudinis a estate
et hieme, quas restagnantes faciunt a mnes.
Arx Phacus in ipsa palude, qua proxima
urbi est, velut insula eminet, aggeri

sustineat et humore circumiusae paludis
nihil laedatur. Muro urbis conjuncta

amni et eadem ponte juncta, ut nec,
oppugnante externo, aditum ab ulla parte
liabeat nec, si quem ibi rex includat,

an inland one:  <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po\ de\ *aoudi/ou ei)s *pe/llan

Hdt. apparently conceives the advance
in three divisions, which he predicates
for the stage from Doriskos to Akanthos,
now abandoned, and the forces on land
all advancing with the king on a single
route. This conception is in itself
absurd, and it conflicts with the topographical
indications appended. The

the latter to its exit in the bay of

<p>The route thus indicated is entirely
different from the route expressly recorded

<p>The route through Krestonike is probably
identical with the route from
Lake Prasias over Mount Dysoros into
Makedonia, described in 5. 17 (which
may represent later knowledge than this
passage).</p>
<p>It is inconceivable that Xerxes, having
reached Akanthos, cut inland to Lake
Prasias, crossed Dysoros, and descended
upon the Echeidoros; but it is more
than probable that one of the army
columns pursued this route from the
Strymon to the Axios.</p>
<p>Xerxes himself may have gone down
to Akanthos to view the canal, and then
returned to Argilos (cp. c. 115 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)
and crossed Chalkidike, with a <foreign rend="ital">corps

limits for the lion are interesting.
He does not of course deny the
existence of the lion in Asia and Libya
(4. 191). He is dealing here simply
with the European lion, which he confines
to the area between the Nestos and
the Acheloos. How far south the lion
wanders he does not clearly say, but he
seems vaguely to think of the Nestos
and the Acheloos, of Abdera and Akarnania,
as due E. and W. of each other,
or, we might say, in the same parallel of
latitude. Perhaps they were so represented
on the Ioniau maps of Hekataios
and Anaximandros (cp. 5. 49). The
eastern term of Europe, beyond the
Nestos, is here problematic. Hdt. can
hardly be thinking of a Europe extending
indefinitely to the East, as in 4. 42
(probably a later passage in composition).
Stein suggests the Pontos as the limit;
but why not the conventional limit of
the Ionians, viz. the Tanais?</p>

lower course, in fact, lies parallel to the
range of the Kambunian mountains, on
the north side. Its upper course, however,
forms a right angle thereto. Hdt.
in making the river the frontier between

be in error, as in uniting the Haliakmon

<div type="commline" n="5">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*makedoni/s</lem></app>. which ought surely to
denote ‘Makedoma proper,’ occurs only
in this passage, and appears to imply
(as Stein suggests) an intentional contrast
to <foreign xml:lang="greek">*makedoni/h</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">gh=</foreign>), Hdt.'s usual term
for the land ruled by Amyntas and
Alexander.</p>
<p>Under this contrast there lurks a
problem and a self-contradiction. Hdt.
and Thucydides both face the problem,
and both succumb to the self-contradiction,
but with a difference, which is
to Hdt.'s credit. The problem concerns
the origin and rise of the Makedonian
monarchy; the inconsistency lies between
the location of the true Makedonians,
inland, up country, away from
the sea, and the Peloponnesian, i.e.
transmarine origin of the reigning house.
This problem, especially in regard to
the gradual extension of Makedonian
sway, Thucydides faces more deliberately
than Hdt. and answers more systematically,
with this result, that he departs
more completely than Hdt. from the
historical order of events, and involves
himself in an ethnological sophism to
cover that departure. But Hdt., too,
has recourse (in this passage) to what
may be called a geographical sophism
to rationalize his history; cp. Thuc. 2.
99 and 8. 138 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Hdt. and Thuc.
agree (1) in accepting the foundation
legend of the Makedonian monarchy,
which represented the kings as Temenids
from Peloponnesian Argos; (2) in admitting
that the <foreign rend="ital">habitat</foreign> of the true
Makedonians was far inland. But Hdt.,
notwithstanding the legend (1), traees
the spread of the power of these
adventurers from Lebaia, and the parts
about Mount Bermios, within measureable
distance of Argos Orestikon, while
Thucydides, notwithstanding the site
(2), makes the conquest start from the
sea-coast, so that any truly Makedonian
land is among the last of the acquisitions
of the Makedonian kings. Thucydides,
indeed, with characteristic lucidity,
marks six stages in the process of
conquest or expansion: (i.) Pieria; (ii.)
Bottia; (iii.) Paionia, between Pella,
originally a Paionian stronghold, and
the sea; (iv.) Mygdonia; (v.) Eordia
and Almopia; (vi.) Anthemûs, Grestonia,
Bisaltia, “and a large part of the land
of the Makedonians themselves.” Makedon
is the last place reached by the
Makedonian conquest! Such a process
could hardly have resulted in the
establishment of a ‘Makedonian’ monarchy.
Thucydides has to a greater or
less extent reversed the order of the
Makedonian conquests in the interests
of the hellenizing legend of the Royal
House, while acknowledging that the
true Makedonians, Lynkestai, Elimiotai
and other tribes, were to be found far
inland. He covers this inconsequence
by the sophistical substitution of <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(
*makedo/nes ou(=toi</foreign> for his first subject,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)ale/candros kai\ oi) pro/gonoi au)tou=</foreign>, as the
heroes of the conquest. Hdt. recognizing
the start of the supposed ‘Temenids’
at Lebaia has preserved the true perspective
of Makedonian expansion,
though that perspective constitutes a
fatal bar to the hellemzing legend of
his Makedonian patrons, 8. 137-139.</p>
<p>None the less in this passage Hdt.,
coming perilously near the Thucydidean
fallacy, plainly identifies <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*makedoni/s</lem></app> or
Makedonia proper with a district on the
sea-coast; in a word, Pieria (cp. cc 131,
177 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), surely the least ‘Makedonian’
of all the Makedoman lands; and thereby
tends to disown admission (2) <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> in
the interests of admission (1).</p>
<p>Blakesley's ingenious idea, according
to which <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*makedoni/s</lem></app> here is the land
enclosed by the fork of the rivers Lydias
and Haliakmon (having therefore no
part to the sea) and Bottia, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">Bottiaii/s</foreign>,
the part outside the rivers, will hardly
do in any case. If Hdt. had meant
that <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*makedoni/s</lem></app> was inclosed by the two
rivers, he would have said so, and the
discovery of a ‘Makedonis’ on the sea
coast is rendered a fatal necessity for
Hdt. by the Legend of the Makedonian
<pb n="163"/>
Royal House. Grote iii. 241n. is mistaken
in saying that Hdt. gives no intimation
that the Pierians had once dwelt south
of the Haliakmon; he overlooked the
passages last eited, and has misled
Blakesley too into misconceiving and
mistaking the points at issue between
Hdt. and Thuc. Hdt. attempts to
solve the common difficulty by identifying
‘Pieria’ with ‘Makedonis,’ Thuc.
by substituting ‘Makedonians’ for
‘Temenids.’</p></div>

Rawlinson (after Leake) asserts that “in
clear weather Olympos and Ossa are full
in view” though the latter from Saloniki
is more than 70 miles distant. Mr. J. A.
R. Munro assures me that Olympos at
least is visible. Olympos is 10,000 feet
in height (Tozer, <title>High</title><foreign xml:lang="greek">i)</foreign><foreign rend="ital">ands,</foreign> ii. 6; 9750
feet, Kiepert, <title>Manual,</title> § 132). Ossa
(feminine) is of lesser height (5-6000?)
but “of even more striking appearance.”
For Xcrxes, his views, his inquiries, his
visit to the scene, his researches, his
theories, his criticisms, one is tempted
in this passage (cc. 128-30) to substitute
Herodotus himself. The proceedings of
Xerxes are too absurd! His desire to
inspect the Peneios finds, indeed, a
parallel in Dareios' inspection of the
Pontos, 4. 85, but with this difference,
that Xerxes was bound for Thessaly,
and was naturally going through Tempe
(<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign> Hdt.!) or at any rate within easy
reach of it, while Dareios took his only
chance of viewing the sea. But that is
the least of Xerxes' absurdities. Not
content with visiting Tempe in his
Sidonian yacht (cp. c. 100 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) with
a decent convoy, he takes the whole
fleet with him on this voyage to Thessaly
and back: an unlikely proceeding,
even if there had been any opposition in
Thessaly to his landing. Other irrational
points in the narrative (noticed <foreign rend="ital">ad ll.</foreign>)
seem further to discredit the story,
which appears to be introduced in order
to give Hdt. an opportunity of airing
his own knowledge and ideas about
Thessaly. That Tempe is further
described c. 173 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> (from another
source) only confirms the hypothesis
that we are here in the presence of a
later addition from the author's hand.
It does not follow that Hdt. visited
Tempe from Therme, and by sea, or at
least from Makedon, as M. Hauvette,
p. 35, suggests. There is, indeed, an
obvious (&lt;*&gt; ast between the character
and tone of this passage on Thessaly
and Tempe, and the geographical
obscurities or incongrnities of Hdt.'s
previous descriptions of Makedonia and
of the route tbrough Thrace. But that
this difference arises from Hdt.'s autopsy
in Thessaly as compared with hearsay or
letters in Thrace and Makedon is perhaps
too much to infer. He is here following
southern sources. In Athens, in Sparta,
and elsewhere he might &lt;*&gt;nd many who
could describe Tempe or Thessaly from
having taken part in one or other of the
expeditions northwards: see further,

of this second pass appears in even
more explicit terms (in c. 173 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>)
and might have been transferred from
that passage (if of earlier composition).
Neither the Perrhaiboi nor the city of
Gonnos are precisely located by Hdt.
The Homeric Catalogne, B 748 ff., places
the folk, with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)enih=nes, peri\ *dwdw/nhn
dusxei/meron</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)mf' i&lt;*&gt;merto\n *titarh/sion</foreign>.
(The Titaresios is the great northern
tributary of the Peneios, flowing down
from Olymposand the Kambunian range.)
Strabo 441, commenting on the passage,
puts the Perrhaiboi on  <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ o)reino/tera xwri/a
tro\s tw=| *)olu/mpw| kai\ toi=s *te/mpesi</foreign>, but
also extends them into Hestiaiotis (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po\
me/rous th=s *(estiaiw/tidos e)peilhfo/tas</foreign>).
This agrees generally with the location
of the Perrhaiboi in other authorities
(Thucyd., Polyb., Livy). Perrhaibia,
though never an officially recognized
district of Thessaly, corresponded to the
mountainous northern portion of the
country. Strabo meutions Olosson (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>)
and Gonnos as Perrhaibian cities.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*go/nnos</lem></app>, or Gonni (celebrated as the

Tempe (Philip retreating after his defeat

18. 16. 1). This location is confirmed
by Livy (<bibl n="Liv. 42.54.8">42. 54. 8</bibl>); “utraque oppida
(Elatia et Gonnus) in faueibus sunt, qua
Tempe adeunt, magis Gonnus.” Cp. 33.
10.11 (=Polyb. &lt;*&gt;  <gap/> 36.10.11 “oppidum
Gonni viginti n &lt;*&gt; ab Larisa abest, in
ipsis fancibus saitus, quae Tempe appellantur,
situm.” 42. 67. 6 “ante ipsa Tempe
in faucibus situm Macedoniae claustia
tutissima praebet et in Thessaliam opportunum
Macedonibus decursum.” Cp. 44.
6. 10 (in the celebrated description of
Tempe) “unum (praesid&lt;*&gt;um) in primo
aditu ad Gonnum erat.” It is quite
obvious that Gonnos is itself a part of
Tempe, and not a separate pass. A path
by which the gorge might be circumvented
may have &lt;*&gt; from, or down to,
Gonnos (like Anopaia at Thermopylai),
but nothing more. Such a path in fact
there was; cp. c. 179  <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Xerxes
could never have rejected Tempe in
favour of a pass by Gonnos, nor would
such a route have led to or from ‘Upper
Makedonia.’ Hdt. has fallen into a
serious error and contradietion, over and
above the absurdity of supposing that
<pb n="165"/>
there was any better or safer pass from
Macedonia into Thessaly than by Tempe.</p>
<p>There were (and are) three main passes
between macedonia and ancient Thessaly:
I. Tempe, which Hdt. describes, but
treats as ‘unsafe,’ and not used by the
Persians. II. The Pass of Petra, further
west, leading from Oloosson (in Perrhaibia)
across to Dion, and therefore joining
there the route through Tempe. It
was probably by this pass that Brasidas
crossed Olympos in 424 B.C., <bibl n="Thuc. 4.78.6">Thucyd. 4.
78. 6</bibl>. III. The Pass of Volustăna, still
further west, likewise starting from
Oloosson and debouching into the upper
valley of the Haliakmon, the only pass
which could be described as leading into
‘Upper Makedonia.’</p>
<p>The superiority of Tempe lies in its
piercing the mountain barrier once for
all. A force coming from Makedonia to
<title>Elassona</title> has still to traverse the lower
passes of Perrhaibia (which figured
largely in the Turkish invasion of ‘Thessaly’
in 1896). It is more than possible
that the Persian columns in 480 B.C.
used all three routes into ancient
Thessaly; and if Xerxes marched still
with the centre (ep. c. 121 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) he
may have crossed by Petra, and visited
Tempe (if he did visit it) from Larisa or
the neighbourhood.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tau/th| ga\r a)sfale/staton e)punqa/neto

was garrisoned, or held against him;
for the Thessalians have by this time
medized and the Greeks have abandoned
Tempe. Yet apart from such opposition,
Tempe was the easiest and probably
the safest natural pass. The horrors
described by Livy 44. 6 partly belong
to a time when the pass was strongly
fortified, are stated without reference to
the other passes, and did not prevent
Tempe being the most frequented of the
routes between Thessaly and Makedonia.
If there is not here a confused reminiscence
of actual or anticipated resistance
at Tempe, it must be regarded as a bit
of bad motivation to account for the
tradition that the king himself entered
Thessaly, not through the pass of Tempe,
but by another route.</p></div>

with the result of confusing his antithesis.
He starts as if to say, ‘The five
rivers which have separate names have
not separate exits; the Peneios receives
all their waters and carries them into
the sea.’ He actually says, ‘The five
streams have an exit, but four of them
lose their names in the Peneios.’ (1) The
omission of the Titaresios; (2) the failure
to distinguish the northern and southern
tributaries; (3) the omission of the line
of hills dividing eastern and western
Thessaly; (4) the restriction of the

the theory or tradition of a time when
‘all Thessaly was under water’ appears
to be scientifically acceptable, subject
perhaps to some reservations or corrections.
Hdt. treats ‘Thessaly’ as a
single plain, or hollow basin, rimmed
round with mountains, and filled with
water, until the formation of the cuttings
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">*te/mpea</foreign>) drained the waters off. The
structure of Thessaly is not quite so
simple as that (cp. notes <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and the
history of the landscape is also more
complicated. That at any date worth
thinking of, in an historical connexion,
the whole of Thessaly was under water
is hardly credible, but the eastern
portion was liable to floods at all times,
and the lakes there no doubt represent
a diminished survival of the &lt;*&gt;nitive
condition. The myth of Deukalion and
Pyrrha may be located in Thessaly, but
is there specially associated with Phthiotis
(Hdt. 1. 56), while the actual flood
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">o( kalou/menos e)pi\ *deukali/wnos kataklusmo/s</foreign>)
is by Aristotle <title>Meteor.</title> 1. 14=352A fixed
at Dodona on the Acheloos—perhaps in
connexion with his theory of the proper
site of <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( *(ella\s h( a)rxai/a</foreign>. The story of
the flood, unfortunately, in any form
now recoverable is late (Apollod. <title>Biblioth.</title>
and Ovid). In the <title>Iliad</title> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 20.478">20. 478</bibl>) one
Deukalion is a Trojan, slain by Achilles;
another (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.451">13. 451</bibl>) is a Kretan, son of
Minos, and father of Idomeneus (cp.
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.180"><title>Od.</title> 19. 180</bibl> f.). Had Hdt. been acquainted
with a story associating his

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ tou/toisi oi( *(/ellhnes e)/tamon o)/rkion</foreign>)
and whose names were officially specified
at the time? Or was there a list of
tribes against which the ‘Amphiktyons’
issued a bill of pains and penalties after
the war? (cp. Plutarch, <title>Themist.</title> 20).
The tense and the order of the narrative
suggests that these surrenders
were announced by the heralds to Xerxes
in Pieria. This implication can hardly
be correct for all the tribes, notably for
the Thebans, who can scarcely have
openly medized before Thermopylai.
<bibl n="Diod. 11.3">Diodoros 11. 3</bibl> professes to know that the
Ainianes, Dolopes, Malians, Perrhaiboi,
and Magnetes had joined the ‘barbarians’
before the abandonment of Tempe by
the Greeks, while the Achaians, Lokrians,
Thessalians, Boiotians, ‘inclined to’ the
‘barbarians’ after its abandonment.
On the date of the patriotic oath see
below. The chronology here as a whole
is far from clear or consistent. The
passage seems to belong to the insertions
at second or third hand; cp. Introduction,
§ 10. The actual list of medizeis given
makes it improbable that the heralds
despatched <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ gh=s ai)/thsin</foreign> had been sent

The Lokrians may also signify a more

Artemision. Hdt. does not distinguish
‘Epiknemidian’ from ‘Opuntian’ Lokrians
(any more than Thucydides); but he
once mentions the Ozolai (8. 32 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>).
It appears, therefore, that where he
speaks of Lokroi simply, he lumps the
Opuntian and Epiknemidian Lokrians
(c. 216 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> 8. 66, 9. 31). They
must here be in view, and obviously
they did not ‘medize’ until after
Thermopylai (cp. 8. 66). ‘Lokris’ as so

The phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/mnein o(/rkion</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/rkia</foreign>) is
Homeric: <cit><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.124"><title>Il.</title> 2. 124</bibl> <quote xml:lang="greek">o(/rkia pista\ tamo/ntes</quote></cit>,
etc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/rkion</foreign> is best taken as an adjective,
to which <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(erei=on</foreign> (or such a word) must be
supplied. The slaying or cutting of the
sacrificial victim marks the act of solemn
agreement; cp. 9. 26 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> 4. 201, and
especially 4. 70 (where <foreign xml:lang="greek">tamnome/nwn</foreign> is
middle). The words might imply that
the names previously specified were
actually documented in the sworn agreement.
The terms of the oath which
follow are more general, and do not
quite bear out this impression. The
exact date of the drafting of this oath is
also open to discussion. Even if the
list above given were official, not
historical, the covenant might be of one
date, the black list of another. Stein
argues that the tense <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/dosan</foreign> in the
formula itself implies that the vow was
retrospective, not prospective (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/soi a)\n
dw=si</foreign>); but the historian might here be
accountable for a change of tense, and
the terms of the oath are in <foreign rend="ital">oratio
obliqua,</foreign> and not exactly quoted. Hdt.
does not clearly mark either time or
place of the oath, but the earliest
occasion on which such a solemnity
could have taken place was at the meeting
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign> at the Isthmos in
481 B.C., cp. c. 145 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> where Diodoros
(i.e. Ephoros) seems to place it, 11. 3
(though after relating the evacuation of
Tempe). The latest date at which it
could be supposed to have taken place
would be on the field of Plataia. It is
placed there and then by Lykourgos
<foreign rend="ital">c. Leokrat.</foreign> 80, before the battle, as an
article in a more general oath (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tau/thn
pi/stin e)/dosan au(toi=s e)n *plapaiai=s pa/ntes
oi( *)/ellhnes o(/te e)/mellon parataca/menoi
ma/xesqai pro\s th\n *ce/rcou du/namin</foreign>), but
the words of the oath, § 81, are certainly
spurious, and Lykourgos is not a very
convincing authority for the place and
time.</p>
<p>Such, indeed, was the view of Theopompos,
<title>Fr.</title> 167 <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ellhniko\s o(/rkos

or others, might also take one-sided
views of this oath; the Akarnanian
orator in Polybios 9. 39. 5 treats it as
an oath taken against the Thebans alone
by the Lakedaimonians. <bibl n="Diod. 11.29">Diodor. 11.
29</bibl> repeats this oath, locates it at the
Isthmos on the way to Plataia, and
omits the tithing clause!</p>
<p>Suidas (<foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">dekateu/ein</foreign>) gives no
indication of place or time (except the
words <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei) nikh/seian</foreign>). Rawhnson (<foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>),
whose note is not free from inaccuracies,
seems to think the story of the oath
grew up in consequence of the punishments
inflicted by the Amphiktyonic
Council afterwards (c. 213 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). But
the oath is required to justify setting
the Council in motion: and what folk
did the Council punish? See further,
Appendix III. § 5.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">oi( tw=| barba/rw| po/lemon a)eira/menoi</lem></app>,
one of Hdt.'s many titles for the confederate
Greeks (cp. c. 148), implies the
formation of the Alliance. The story is
plainly ‘proleptic,’ and is somewhat out
of place here. It belongs to a highly
composite passage (cc. 128-37) which
was inserted, perhaps not all at the same
date, into the previons draft of the work.

regard this agreement as a separate and

a point on which, of course, he may
easily be mistaken. Diodoros, 11. 3.

Hdt. in fact does not profess to give the

<foreign rend="ital">inter alia</foreign> as implying (1) a test of

Baehr in taking as ‘to tithe’ for a god,
a tenth being handed over, but no

in favour of this interpretation. This
view is supported by the Scholiast to
Aristeides, p. 224 <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ de/katon me/ros a)nelei=n</foreign>.
A further problem would arise, whether
the dedicated tithe was to he handed out
once for all, or was to be a periodical
rent-charge; <foreign rend="ital">ihre Grundstucke zinspflichtig

Boeckh (<title>Staatshaush.</title> i.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 444=i.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> 399).

not a case of penalty; <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign> is expressed,
and everlasting punishments are hard
to enforce in this world. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Stein
understands <foreign xml:lang="greek">dekateu=sai</foreign> to be used as
equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqierou=n</foreign> (Harpokration
<foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign>), and to mean here that the
medizers were to become <foreign rend="ital">mit Leib und
Gut,</foreign> the god's property. But Harpokration
(<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>) also interprets <foreign xml:lang="greek">dekateu=sai</foreign>
as simply <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n dekath\n ei)spra/ttesqai</foreign>, and
the cases where it is equivalent to
<foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqierou=n</foreign> (as of a virgin, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rkteu=sai</foreign> of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">mnh=sai</foreign>) are not cases of penal action.
(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) The simple and obvious meaning of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">dekateu=sai</foreign> is to tithe, to dedicate a tenth;
it retains this meaning in this place,
and implies, not wholesale dedication,
but wholesale spoliation; a tenth of the
spoil is to be given to the god, but what
of the nine-tenths? They are to remain
in the hands of the spoilers. This is
the sense which suits the anecdote, 1.
89. Thus the word is used as a <foreign rend="ital">meiosis,</foreign>
euphemistic or ironical.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=| e)n *delfoi=si qew=|</lem></app>: the most
suspicious feature of the whole story.
It is significant that in Diodoros (11. 3),
where this oath is recorded, <foreign xml:lang="greek">toi=s qeoi=s</foreign> is
substituted; so too Polyb. 9. 39. 5. At
the Isthmus-meeting at which Diodoros
(Ephoros) dates the oath, a promised
dedication to Delphi was not yet quite
out of the question: was Delphi still
hesitating? was the vow a bid for the
favour of the Oracle? or was not Delphi
itself ‘medizing,’ or soon to medize; cp.
c. 140 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> and Appendix III. § 7. It
is still more doubtful whether, at Plataia,
the Greeks would have promised dedications
to Delphi; the rehabilitation of
the national Holy of Holies had hardly
yet begun. This phrase might therefore
be cited as evidence of the fictitious
character of this oath, and the whole
story in which it is embedded. But is
it necessary to carrv scepticism so far?
The form in which Hdt. reports the oath
may belong to the period of Delphi's
rehabilitation, and exhibit the tendency
of the time, but the form is not strictly
authentic, and need not be taken to
discredit the fact of a solemn vow of
vengeance, registered by the Greek representatives
at the Isthmos prospectively,
and repeated, it may be with express
enumeration of the culprits, at Plataia,
<pb n="174"/>
whether before or after the battle. In
connexion with this covenant was undertaken
the siege of Thebes (which lived
on in men's minds as the special fulfilment
of the vow; cp. <bibl n="Xen. Hell. 6.3.20">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 6. 3.
20</bibl>, 6. 5. 35; Polyb. 9. 39), as also the
campaign against the Thessalians, the
disastrous conclusion of which (6. 72)
helped no doubt to stay further attempts
to fulfil the vow, to which perhaps opposition
on political grounds was added:
cp. Plutarch, <title>Themist.</title> 20.</p></div></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pro/teron *darei/ou pe/myantos</lem></app>:
cp. 6. 48, where, however, not a word is
reported of the outrage on the Persian
heralds, much less of the wrath of Talthybios.
The whole story (ec 133-7)
inust be an addition, and, at least the
end of it, one of the latest from the
author's hand; cp. notes <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> to c. 137,
and Introduction, § 9.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in 6. 48 nothing
is said even of heralds having been sent
to Athens, or to Sparta. It is possible
that heralds were sent to Sparta by
Dareios; as to their treatment cp. my
notes to <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> But were any heralds ever
sent by Dareios to Athens? Certainly
not. (1) Artaphrenes (son of Hystaspes)
had demanded earth and water of
Athenian ambassadors in Sardes, c. 509
B.C., 5. 73; and (2) again—if the story
be not a doublette—the Athenians having
sent ambassadors to Sardes warning
Artaphrenes to give no heed to Hippias,
Artaphrenes had demanded the tyrant's
restoration, 5. 96. After that (3) the
Athenians had deelared war (!) against
the Persians, <foreign rend="ital">ibid.,</foreign> and (4) went to Sardes,
in 498 B.C., and burnt it. (5) This act
greatly angered the Persians, 5. 102, and
Dareios, who took a solemn vow of vengeance,
5. 105. This story, and indeed
the whole sequence of events, is inconsistent
with the notion that Dareios, in
492 B.C., afterwards despatched heralds
to Athens, of whom moreover (6) nothing
is said in 6. 48. Further, (7) the idea is
inconsistent with the story of the mission
of Mardo&lt;*&gt;os in 492 B.C., 6. 44, 45; and
(8) if Dareios sent heralds to Athens,
against whom was he at the same time
levying a fleet? 6. 48. Lastly, (9) the
occurrence of the record here, instead of
in 6. 48, is very unfortunate for its
historical character, showing, as it does,
that (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) when Hdt. wrote 6. 48, either he
did not know this story about throwing
Persian heralds into the Barathron in
491 B.C., or he had already inserted it,
or the major part of it, in this place, or
he preferred, for some reason, to insert
it here; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the story is a rider on the
<title>Wrath of Talthybios.</title> It is possible that
we should never have heard of Persian
heralds thrown into the Barathron in
491 B.C. but that Spartan heralds were
put to death in Athens in 430 B.C. We
must, therefore, conclude that no Persian
heralds were ever sent to Athens by
Dareios, much less thrown into the
Barathron.</p>
<p>Why, then, was such a crime fathered
on the Athenians? Heralds had been
sent to Sparta; they had, perhaps,
been badly treated, outraged, possibly
even slain (though that seems unlikely),
but the Spartans certainly had something
on their conscience in this matter,
or we should hardly have had the story
of the <title>Wrath of Talthybios.</title> It was
desired, then, to tar Athens with the
same brush. The rough jest has quite a
laconic ring in it! But crities should
not swallow so easily the notion that
heralds had been sent to Athens and
thrown into the Barathron, if they would
have us believe that Persian heralds at
Sparta had been thrown into a well.</p></div>

These men were Talthybiads, as the

distiuctions of birth and wealth

falls <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> at the earliest into the

indeed he is the father. The absence
of the patronymic here and the different
position apparently occupied by
this Hydarnes favour the latter hypothesis;
not but what there would have
been time for a promotion between this
episode and that, while the father would
have been rather an old man in 484-481
B.C. (cp. 3. 70). Blakesley, indeed,
argues that Hdt. regards this Hydarnes
as a third person; but the failure to
describe him fully, perhaps the error in
his description, may be due to the
source.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">strathgo\s de\ tw=n paraqalassi/wn

th=s strathgi/hs</foreign> (5. 26), in which capacity
he takes Byzantion, Kalchedon, Antandros,
Lamponion, Lemnos, and Imbros,
after the expedition of Dareios into
Europe.</p>
<p>The question is whether this title
represents a satrapy, or simply a military
post. Rawlinson understands it in the
latter sense as “the command of the
Persian troops (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nqrw/pwn</foreign>!) in the satrapy
of Lydia, and perhaps also in that of
Bithynia.” Krumbholz, <foreign rend="ital">de Asiae minoris
satrap. Pers.</foreign> (1883), 23 sqq., argues in
favour of the other view. This anecdote
decidedly reinforces that hypothesis:
Spartan heralds to Asia would hardly
escape a visit to the satrap <foreign rend="ital">in loco.</foreign>
But I am disposed to think that the
satrapy here in question is not the
‘third’ (as Krumbholz assumes) but
the ‘first’ or Sardian, which may very
well have been held by Hydarnes (the
elder) in succession to Artaphrenes (the
elder). The phraseology is not against
this suggestion; it is not in either case
technically correct, would apply to one
or other satrapy equally well, and something
like it is indeed predicated of Artaphrenes
in 5.30 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n e)piqalassi/wn tw=n e)n
th=| *)asi/h| a)/rxei pa/ntwn</foreign>). It will hardly be
contended that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">paraqala/ssioi</foreign> are in
the Hellespont, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqala/ssioi</foreign> in
the Lydian satrapy!. (Rather perhaps
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piqala/ssioi</foreign> might even cover both.)
Thus though the <foreign xml:lang="greek">strathgo\s tw=n paraqalassi/wn
a)ndrw=n</foreign> in 5. 25 is probably
the satrap of Dasky&lt;*&gt;eion, the  <foreign xml:lang="greek">strathgo\s

be the satrap of Sardes. The worst

it. Cp. App. Crit.</p></div>

have been hoped. The score finally lies
with Xerxes and the lower morality. Hdt.
does not come very well out of this story:
nowhere does he apply the doctrine of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ti/sis</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">poinh/</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/kh, ne/mesis</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mh=nis</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">fqo/nos</foreign>
to actual affairs in a more trivial or
jejune spirit: the austere silence of
Thucydides, who tells the same story in
his own fashion, is here Hdt.'s condemnation.

exactly is it that the Lakedaimonians

fate of the men in 430 B.C. was due to
the <foreign rend="ital">menis</foreign> of Talthybios; possibly that
this manifestation of the <foreign rend="ital">menis</foreign> was
not unprecedented, not the first of its
kind. Lakedaimonians may even have
told the story of the <foreign rend="ital">devotio</foreign> of Sperthias
and Boulis: may even have connected
it with a real or supposed outrage on
Persian heralds or envoys in the days of
Kleomenes. Hdt. appears at least to
take credit to himself for the perception
of the divine moral of the facts, especially
as lying in the parentage of the two
Spartans executed at Athens in 430 B.C.
But was he really left to himself to
draw this moral, if all the rest of the
story was reported to him by Lakedaimonians,
in the form above given? It
seems hardly credible. If the moral is
all his own, the facts have not, perhaps,
escaped manipulation by him. The
transaction in 430 B.C. is somewhat
differently reported by Thucydides, and
in a way somewhat to obscure or spoil
the Herodotean moral. Still more
perhaps have the earlier ‘facts’ been
transfigured in the interest of an immoral
morality: the ‘fable’ has ever been the
produet of the ‘moral,’ which it is
supposed to generate.</p></div>

<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ggeloi</foreign> but not <foreign xml:lang="greek">kh/rukes</foreign>. In any case,

<p>But agaiu, as the wrath had long
ceased, and divination had been restored,
a fresh outbreak of wrath seems to
require a fresh crime. Hdt. has to
explain the expiation of 430 B.C. as
traceable to the crime of 491 (odd):
surely a flaw in the divine justice, on

This passage, and indeed the whole
chapter, is polemical, argumentative,
apologetic, a brief on behalf of Athens:
generally supposed to have been written
about the time of the outbreak of the
Peloponnesian war (so Baehr, Rawlinson,
Stein <foreign rend="ital">et al.</foreign>) and certainly well suitmg
the circumstances of that time. In that
case, however, it must be regarded as
among the passages last added to these
Books, by the author's hand, unless we
endorse the theory of Kirchhoff, which
assumes that such notices of contemporary
events mark just the points
respectively reached, at the time of
their occurrence, by the author, in the
single and continuous composition of the
work. It would also probably in that
case have been composed at Athens, and
for an Athenian audience. An insertion
the whole chapter might be; for though
the next chapter grows apparently out
of the argument and conclusion of this
one, that appearance might be a result
of clever dove-tailing and revision. The
tone of the chapter, however, seems
addressed rather to a non-Athenian than
to an Athenian public—unless we suppose
Hdt. to be trying to win a very cheap
cheer from his audience; and the positive
ascription of the passage to the date of
the Archidamian war assumes that the
unpopularity of Athens dated only from
the ‘thirties,’ and was a growth of ‘the
years of Peace.’ Such a view implies
a complete misreading of the history of
the <title>Pentekontaëteris.</title> This passage might
have been written opportunely any
time between the breach with Sparta in
462 B.C. and the Thirty Years' Peace, as
well as in the ‘thirties.’ It might belong
to the first draft of the work; or,
if an addition, it may have been added
in the second period of composition,
either in Greece or even at Thurii.
Least of all need we locate its composition
and publication in Athens: Hdt.

out of the question, from a historical

Delphi was not shaking with fear at that

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">toi=si *)aqhnai/oisi</lem></app>: Hdt. doubtless
understands the term of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">qeopro/poi</foreign>,
and supposes them not to have left
Delphi or reported to the Athenians at
home the doleful response obtained.
The exaet interval between the two
responses Hdt. does not indicate: was
it hours, or days, or longer? Was the
first response not conveyed to Athens,
or perhaps to Salamis, before the second
was emitted? Or had the two Theoroi
directions (from Themistokles) to move
heaven and earth in order to obtain a
Delphic sanction for the plan of remaining
at Salamis and there doing battle?
The first response supports the plan,
afterwards ascribed to the Peloponnesians,
of the complete evacuation of Attica and
Salamis, and the transfer of the Athenians
to the Peloponnese; the second favours
the plan of those in Athens who were
determined to make a stand at Salamis
(and even perhaps upon the mainland).
These responses ean only be dated in
reason to the days or weeks when that
strategic question was the dominant and
urgent one. It is conceivable that
Delphi delivered two eontradictory directions
on two successive days; but it
seems not unlikely that a more considerable
interval separated the two responses,
during which Themistokles contrived,
by one means or another, to adjust the
wires at Delphi. It is a frappant inconsequence
in the story of Salamis
that Themistokles is not represented as
making any use of these responses in
his arguments with Eurybiades and the
Peloponnesians (8. 60). The proper inference
therefrom is, not that these are
mere <foreign rend="ital">vaticinia post eventum,</foreign> and the
whole story of the Athenian <foreign rend="ital">theoria</foreign> to
Delphi a later fiction, but that Hdt.
follows in different parts of his narrative

the ritual; or, if ‘Demeter’ might stand

that the battle should take place either

Crit. It is plain that there was a party
in Athens, headed or supported by the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">xrhsmolo/goi</foreign>, in favour of following the
precedent of Teos and Phokaia in 546
B C. (cp. 1. 164-8), abandoning their
country (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( patri/s</foreign> c. 141 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) and
finding a new home beyond the seas.
Such a project is practically inconceivable
in 482 B.C. (where Stein dates the
oracles), or even in 480 B.C. before the
<pb n="194"/>
collapse of the defence at ArtemisionThermopylai.
Themistokles himself
kept that plan in reserve to force a
battle in the Straits; cp. 8. 62 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>;
and it may be that the idea had been
formulated long before as a possibility,
if the worst came to the worst. It
might even be older than the days of
Marathon. But that it was seriously
proposed in Athens before blow had
been struck in 480 B.C. is (<foreign rend="ital">me iudice</foreign>)

These words clearly express a formal
resolution or act of the Boule and
Ekklesia, but the exact point or stage
of the proceedings, and the exact purpose
of the dogma, are not quite so clear.
If this act is the consequence of the
oracular responses, and the interpretation
of Themistokles, then this resolution
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) is inadequate and inconsequent, for
it ought to specify Salamis (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)mfi\
*salami=na</foreign>) as the scene of resistance, and
(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) its date would of course be subsequent
to the reception of the responses, i.e.
after the breakdown at Thermopylai.
But the terms of the dogma (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pio/nta

and preparations, and constitute
the original determination of Athens to
resist the invasion <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a(/ma *(ellh/nwn toi=si

(cp. c. 175 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). Stein (and others)

but we have here to do with an earlier

had already subsisted a decade, yet this
meeting appears as the constitutive act
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dido/ntwn sfi/si lo/gon kai\ pi/stin</lem></app>) and
may very well have been held at Sparta
in the Hellenion, probably the normal

this story would be more credible had
the names and cities of the ‘spies’ been
preserved. Were they all Spartans?
Or was there one Spartan with two
Athenians? Or were they from three
different states? Or how were they
describable? The confederate Greeks
would surely have had many sources of
information open to them in Asia, but
they might well have wished to be informed
by trustworthy emissaries of their
own, and it would doubtless have been
easy for European Greeks to have haunted
the Persian camp all along, provided
that the Greek subjects of the king did
not betray them. Such a mission, and
more than one, there may have been;

of the reports of these Greek spies at

spies, to illustrate a trait in the character
of Xerxes, and of despotism, at least so

welcome; and the <foreign rend="ital">termini ad quos</foreign> are

here would fit the situation in 491 B.C.

better. Aigina had given earth and

story of the war is told 6. 76-83, and in

Hdt. (See my notes <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign> Bks. IV.-VI.

the problem of the inner condition of
Argos after the Kleomenean war: the

war were fit for military service in
481 B.C. The response may have been
brought out again in 481 B.C., or even
possibly later, in a purely apologetic and
retrospective interest, when the conduet
of Argos had been violently attacked.

institutions of the period. The offer to
let the Argive ‘king’ have one vote
against the ‘two votes’ of the two
Spartan kings implies that the two
Spartan kings possess a joint <title>Hegemonia,</title>
not to say, vote together as one man!
Stein is surprised that Hdt. should have
overlooked the contradiction between
the statement here (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)/kwn dunato\n . .
kwlu/ein ou)de/n</lem></app>) and the law recorded 5.
75 (upon which cp. my notes <foreign rend="ital">ad l.c.</foreign>):
as if Hdt. were not constantly overlooking
contradictions between one statement
and another, drawn from different
sources, used in different connexions,
belonging to different periods of composition!
(Moreover, this story was prob<pb n="204"/>
ably of earlier composition in the genesis
of Hdt.'s work than that passage.)
Abicht avoids Stein's surprise by a still
more innocent suggestion: the Spartan
ambassadors forgot the law in question
of set purpose. The real poiut to observe
is that we have here not a Spartan but
merely an Argive aecount of the transaction.
If any discussion on the question
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(gemoni/a</foreign> took place in 481
B.C. we may be sure that Sparta made
no such offer as this. But it is possible
that the absurd Argive story may have
some basis in facts loug previous, and
that at some date, when the two Spartan
kings still went out to war together
(an arrangement which only came to an
cnd after the Argive war of Kleomenes
and Demaratos; see my notes <foreign rend="ital">l.c</foreign>), there
may have been negotiations between
Sparta and Argos, the terms of which
served as a precedent for this Argive
story of the negotiations in 481 B.C.</p>
<p>If ever such an offer was made to
Argos, the Argives were shortsighted in
not accepting it: they might fairly have
counted on their one king being able,
as a rule, to divide the Spartan twain.</p>
<p>That the Argives had a real ‘king’
in 481 B.C. is not credible; but they
may have had, as the Athenians had,
a titular magistrate, possibly with an
annual tenure, bearing the title of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">basileu/s</foreign>. The position of such a republican
magistracy would indeed be
still weaker against the two Spartan
kings (if actiug together); but this
reference to the Argive king also serves
somewhat to antiquate the story.</p></div>

one of the most characteristic
confessions of Greek particularism on
record, and its most significant note
is neither the protest agaiust Spartan
greed (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pleoneci/a</foreign>) nor the exhibition of
Argive pride, but the tacit assumption
that the common-sense of Hellas would
fully endorse an <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)tonomi/a</foreign> purchased by
surrender to the ‘Barbarian,’ yea, that
subjection to the foreigner was better
than concession to the Hellene. This
spirit of uncompromising self-assertion,
the dogma in fact of the individual immortality
of the Greek city-state, was
at once the strength and the weakness
of Hellas. It long helped to make
Greece unconquerable, but it helped also
to make her liberties a prey to any
foreign power, which could divide the
Greeks, city from city, clique from clique:
a policy inaugurated by Persia, matured

this statement is flatly contradicted by
6. 54, where Hdt. says that, <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s o( para\
*perse/wn lo/gos le/getai</foreign>, Perseus himself
was an Assyrian, and became a Greek,
and therefore was not the son of Danae,
and ultimately an Egyptian, which is
there given as the Hellenic version of
the legend, and is here tacitly assumed
as the Persian. This contradiction shows,
as Blakesley pointed out, that this story
of the Xerxean embassy to Argos is a
fiction, and a Greek fiction. It shows
also how easily Hdt. allows himself to
report conflicting and contradictory views
and traditions; but the present instance
is easier to understand on the hypothesis
that this passage is of early composition,
than on the hypothesis that
Hdt. composed the elaborately argumentative
passage 6. 54, and then wrote
down this story, 7. 150, in flat contradiction,
without wincing, without a
reference back or qualification. This
instance goes to swell the evidence in
favour of the earlier composition of this
section of the work. Cp. c. 61 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign>
and Introduction, §§ 7, 8. The political
play on the words ‘Perseus’ and ‘Perses’
may perhaps be traced back to the close
of the sixth century, and was utilized
in the interests of the medizing Aleuadai,
who also claimed descent from Herakles;

in 481 B C., nor of the return of these
heralds, c. 131, and the list of ‘medizing’
states which there follows—in which
the name of Argos does not occur. The
<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(rmh/</foreign> of Xerxes dated before that, whether
in the psychological sense (cp. c. 19

that Hdt. is here following a written
authority. The story of the embassy
of Kallias to the court of Artaxerxes
had been made the subject of actual
historiography before Hdt. wrote this
passage. By what author, or authors?
Stein suggests Hellanikos (presumably
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n th=| *)attikh=| cuggrafh=|</foreign>: cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.97.2">Thuc. 1.
97. 2</bibl>). May not the authority more
probably be put down as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*persika/</foreign> of
Dionysios of Miletos? which perhaps
carried down the story of the GraecoPersian
wars to the date of the treaty
of Kalhas. Cp. Introduction, § 10.</p>
<p>In any case this chapter looks like
an insertion to be dated some considerable
time after the thirty years' peace
(445 B.C.), and may very well be among
the last additions to the work by the
author.</p>
<p>Stein would date these embassies soon
after the death of Xerxes and the accession
of Artaxerxes, seeing no sense in
the Argive question otherwise. But (1)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">polloi=si e)/tesi u)/steron tou/twn</foreign> suits a
date about 445 better than a date about
465 B.C. (2) From 462-51 B.C. Argos
was in alliance with Athens, and Athens
was conducting active hostilities against
Persia; there were no such embassies
to Persia during that period. (3) These
events are not to be connected with the
battle of the Eurymedon and abortive
peace-negotiations following upon it,
the best date for that battle being 468 B.C.
(cp. Busolt, iii. 1. 1897, 143 f.), which
falls into the reign of Xerxes, and the
interval between the establishment of
Artaxerxes on the throne and the
Atheno-Argive alliance is not worth
considering, especially as (4) those events
of 465-62 B.C. would hardly have been
made the subject of historiography before
Hdt. wrote the first draft of his history;
whereas, before he laid hand on the last
draft of his history, the events of 445 B.C.
and the cesser of hostilities might very
well have been consigned to a literary
record. (5) The next chapter seems to
belong to the date of the Atheno-Argive
alliance, and to the same date of composition
as c. 150, and indeed cc. 148,
149; but this chapter is apparently an
insertion, interrupting the natural argument,
which goes on from c. 150 to
c. 152.</p>

(with the <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">te</lem></app> after <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*ce/rchs</lem></app>) in a revision
of the work. This chapter contains
more than one undesigned evidence to
show that it was written originally
before the thirty years' truce. (1) The
apology for Argos has been very generally
taken to refer to a time when the
sins of Argos in the Persian war were in
a fair way to be condoned, and the
alliance of Argos was being courted on
this side or that. After the thirty
years' truce between Argos and Sparta
concluded in 451 B.C. no such situation
recurs until towards the close of the
Archidamian war—which is altogether
too late a date for this passage. The
period between 462-51 B.C. supplies
the most obviously suitable date for this
Apology, and also for the Argive <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>
above related in cc. 148, 149. (2) Even
more remarkable and characteristic of
an early date for the composition of this
passage is the critical maxim formulated
by Hdt. for his own historiography:
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)gw\ de\ o)fei/lw <gap/> e)s pa/nta lo/gon</lem></app>. It
would be rather late in the day for Hdt.
to be announcing so fundamental an
axiom of his composition, if he had
already composed the greater part of his
work, or if all that now precedes this
passage in the work were of earlier date
in production. One expression in the
chapter might admit of a contrary
interpretation, suggesting that the object
here in view is not to whitewash Argos
but to censure Athens; but that expression
also admits of an interpretation
conformable with the previous argument,
cp. note <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> on <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ai)/sxista pepoi/htai</lem></app>.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="3">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ou)k e)/xw a)trekews ei)pei=n</lem></app>. It is
almost inconceivable that Hdt. with his
Athenian sources and connexions should
be &lt;*&gt;nable to ascertain whether the
embassy of Kallias to Susa was accompanied
by Argive ambassadors,
asking friendship of the king. It is
probable, therefore, that originally this
uncertainty only applied to the problem
of the negotiations of the Argives with
Xerxes, and that the words have received
an extension, not originally intended, by
the insertion of the clause  <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">te <gap/> kai\

necessary by the insertion of c. 151 into
the previous draft of the Book. This
suggestion is confirmed by the observation
that the vague <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">au)tw=n</lem></app> which

mentators have not perceived that there
is a confusion of ideas in the passage,
not unparalleled in Hdt.: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the case of
men (peoples, folks) who believe themselves
to be ‘worse off’ (more miserable)
than their neighbours; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the case of
men (peoples, folks) who believe their
neighbours to be ‘worse’ (more wicked)
than themselves. In the first case a
study of their neighbours' case, in
comparison with their own, would
convince each such set of persons that
their neighbours' lot was not really
preferable to their own; in the second
case, that their neighbours' vices were
not worse than their own. These two
cases are both alike absolute commonplaces
of the proverbial moralist and
satirist. For example, the first is the
theme of Horace in <cit><bibl n="Hor. S. 1.1"><title>Satire</title> i. 1</bibl> <quote xml:lang="la">qui fit,

or censoriousness, more knowledge of
one's self. There is a skeleton in every
cupboard, and those who live in glass
houses should not throw stones. The
heart knoweth its own bitterness, and
there's no point in the pot calling the
kettle black. It is perhaps especially
easy for Hdt. to fall into the confusion
of thought between  <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaka/</foreign> as wickedness
and <foreign xml:lang="greek">kaka/</foreign> as wretchedness, from his fatal
tendency to regard all misery as due to
sin, and every misfortune as a divine
judgement. But in the present case he
may have been misled by a certain
delicacy, or courtesy, into substituting
in the first instance the <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)kh/ia kaka/</foreign> for
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)sxrw=s pepoihme/na</foreign>, yet it must be
admitted that there are at least two
other cases of mere confusion of thought,
very like the present one: the one in c.
162 <foreign rend="ital">infra, ubi vid.,</foreign> the other in 3. 46,
where the metaphor of the meal-bag has
absolutely no point in the application of
the Samian ohgarchs. (It really belongs
to an application made by the Chianswhen
famine-stricken, cp. Sext. Emp. <title>Adv.
Math.</title> 2. 23 ed. Bekker, p. 679.) In
fact Hdt. is liable to put a fable (or
metaphor) and a moral together which
do not strietly belong to each other.
The point of the present passage lies,
however, not in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)kh/ia kaka/</foreign> and the
class of gnomes which those words
suggest, but in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai&lt;*&gt;sxista pepoi/htai</foreign>,
and these words, in connexion with the
previous chapter and the reference to the
embassy of Kallias, might be thought to
convey a censure of Perikles and of the
policy of Athens in having made peace
with Persia; in which case the passage
as a whole would all be of one date, and
that after the thirty years' truce, and
its object would be not so much to
whitewash Argos as to censure Athens.
For several reasons we may reject this
hypothesis. (i.) It would represent a
fanatical attitude on the part of Hdt.
which is ill in accord with his usual
temper. (ii.) Had he desired to point
such a moral he must have specified
above the object of the mission of
Kallias. (iii.) Athens does not escape
quite with its ‘withers unwrung,’ for
Athens was responsible in the very first
instance, long before Argos or any other
Greek state, for something very like
‘medism,’ cp. 5. 73. The moral of Hdt.,
in fact, applied pretty well all round at
the time it was drawn. There was
hardly a Greek state which had not
compromised itself at one time or another
with Persia; they were all more or less
tarred with the same brush. Even
Sparta had been compromised to some
extent by the medism of Pausanias,
though she resisted the blandishments
of Megabazos in 457 B.C.;  <bibl n="Thuc. 1.109.2">Thuc. 1. 109.
2</bibl> (cp. Busolt, iii. 1. 328). ‘I am
convinced of this much, that if all
mankind were to bring each folk its
own grievous burden into one place,
with a view to exchange with their
neighbours: after examining carefully
their neighbours' burdens, each would
be glad to carry away again home the
burden they had brought in. Thus the
conduct of the Argives is not so very
much worse than that of others.’ With
Hdt.'s philosophy in this passage cp.
Chamisso's poem <title>Die Kreutzschau.</title> We

reading is right (cp. App. Crit.) there are
two things astonishing Hdt. What are
they? One is clearly that such a man
as Telines, an effeminate and soft person,
wrought a deed so daring as the restoration
of the exiles, or seceders; but what
is the other? The nearest thing seems
to be, that any one should be able to
effect such a result by such means and
on such conditions (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou/toisi d' w)=n pi/sunos
. . e)p' w(=| te</foreign>) without any band of
warriors (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/xwn ou)demi/an a)ndrw=n du/namin</foreign>),
and simply relying on the possession and
display of the holy treasures. Stein
takes the wonder to be, how Telines
originally became possessed of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ra/</foreign>,
but <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)k e)/xw ei)pei=n</foreign> is an expression of
ignorance, not of wonder. The acquisition
or possession of such things was not
out of the way wonderful; but Hdt. may
well be surprised at a great political
result based upon a hierophantic display;
cp. his remarks on that <foreign xml:lang="greek">prh=gma eu)hqe/staton</foreign>,
the restoration of Peisistratos by
the pseudo-Athene, i. 60.</p>
<p>We may suspect that there was more
than appears behind the achievement of
Telines also; and that the mere display
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ra/</foreign>, however genuine, was not the
whole secret of his success. The softness
of the priest is perhaps but a metaphorical
transfer from his divinities; cp. below.
The priesthood might indeed be a highly
advantageous avenue, or appanage, to a
<foreign rend="ital">tyrannis.</foreign> Gelon transplanted the cult to
Syracuse, and built there a temple for it
out of the Punic spoil; Hieron succeeded
him in the priesthood: cp. Pindar, <title>Ol.</title>
6. 95 <foreign rend="ital">et schol.</foreign></p>
<p>The legendary achievement of their
ancestor might be connected with a
restoration of exiles, or it might conceivably
have marked a restriction and
diminution of power, which Gelon recovered,
and more than recovered, but
by purely secular means.</p></div>

Kadmeian Theras, and so to the illustrious

<pb n="214"/>
<p>Three great wars conducted by Hippokrates
are enumerated:—</p>
<p>I. <title>Kallipolis and Naxos.</title> Naxos was a
Chalkidic colony accounted the earliest in
Sicily (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.3.1">Thuc. 6. 3. 1</bibl>), the Chalkidic oikist
having Naxian emigrants with him;
cp. Steph. B. <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*xalki&lt;*&gt;s</foreign>; Freeman,

<title>Sicily,</title> i., Appendix, Note XV. Kallipolis
was a sub-colony from Naxos, probably
situate (like the metropolis) on the E.
coast; Freeman, i. 379 ff. Of the
details of this war nothing is known.
Kallipolis perhaps bore the brunt of the
struggle, and perished. Naxos appears
among the Athenian allies in Sicily, <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Thuc. 6-7, but was destroyed by D&lt;*&gt;onysios
in 403 B.C. (<bibl n="Diod. 14.15">Diodor. 14. 15</bibl>).
Tauromenion (<title>Taormina</title>) afterwards
took its place (Freeman, i. 314 ff.).</p>
<p>II. <title>Zankle and Leontinoi.</title> Like the
previous war, directed against the Chalkidic
(Ionian) element in the island, but
with a difference. Zankle is undoubtedly
the later Messene (cp. c. 164 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), the
change perhaps dating from the occupation
of the place by the exiled Messenians
454 B.C. Cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.4.5-6">Thuc. 6. 4. 5-6</bibl>, and <foreign rend="ital">infra
l.c.</foreign> Leontinoi was a settlement from
Naxos (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.3.3">Thuc. 6. 3. 3</bibl>), remarkable, among
all Sikeliote cities, as occupying an
inland site (cp. Freeman, i. 368).</p>
<p>A story of a quarrel at Zankle, in which
Hippokrates was engaged, is told by Hdt.,
at least in part, 6. 23 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> and it is
remarkable that there is here no reference
back to that passage. The two passages
are doubtless from different sources, and
Hdt. may have failed (as often) to
connect them. The problem of composition
becomes more acute in relation
to the duplicate stories in c. 164 <foreign rend="ital">infra,
ubi vid.</foreign> Cp. also Introduction, §§ 7 f.
Whether the war here mentioned is the
intervention, the story of which is told
in 6. 23, is not quite clear. Leontinoi
does not figure in that account. There
is no siege by Hippokrates. The intervention
results in a shameful bargain
between Hippokrates and the lawless
Samians, who had seized the city, at the
expense of the Zanklaians. Perhaps
the war here referred to was an earlier
episode, by which Hippokrates had
gained the suzerainty which he appears,
from that story, to have claimed over
Zankle. Cp. Freeman, <title>Sicily,</title> ii. 113.
Leontinoi appears at one time under a
tyrant Ainesidemos (<bibl n="Paus. 5.22.7">Pausan. 5. 22. 7</bibl>),
possibly the man mentioned above as an

<p>III. <title>Syracuse, and</title> (<foreign rend="ital">its subject</foreign>) ‘<foreign rend="ital">barbarians’</foreign>
(Sikels). Syracuse, a foundation
by the Korinthian Archias (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.3.2">Thuc. 6. 3.
2</bibl>), claimed to be the oldest Dorian and
all but the oldest Hellenic settlement
in the island. This passage in Hdt. and
an obscure reference in Pindar (<title>Nem.</title> 9.
39) comprise all that is known of this
war. Freeman locates the defeat of the
Syracusans on the Heloros (492 B.C.)
rather far inland, at the crossing of the
stream between the modern towns of
Noto and Rossolino; Chromios, the
friend of Gelon, distinguished himself
in this battle (Pindar <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>). Hdt. is
our sole authority for the sequel: the
arbitration between Hippokrates and
Syracuse, which resulted in the passing
of Kamarina (the one Dorian settlement
which showed disloyalty to Dorism&lt;*&gt;)
into the hands of Hippokrates: this
acquisition carried his dominions along
the south coast further west.</p>
<p>It might be suspected that this ‘Arbitration’
was really an ‘Intervention’
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)rru/santo</lem></app>); but a court composed from
Korinth and Korkyra, whose mutual
hostility was inveterate and notorious,
might be trusted to do substantial justice
on any point where the court was unammous,
or even came to a decision. We
have, then. in this case probably a
genuine instance of the practice of
arbitration among the Greeks. At the
same time the tyrant would scarcely
have accepted the kind offices of Koriuth
and Korkyra on behalf of Syracuse, if
he had been in a position to dictate
terms. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.5.3">Thucyd. 6. 5. 3</bibl> seems to give
a somewhat different account of the
affair: Kamarina, a rebellious Syracusan
settlement, had been destroyed by the
metropolis, and its land was handed over
to Hippokrates as ransom for Syracusan
prisoners. This result may, however,
have been attained by the good offices
of Korinth and Korkyra; and the
prisoners may have been taken at the
Heloros.</p></div>

Grote, iv. 304 n., suspects Aristotle of

an admirable harbour, other physical
advantages of the site, a position on the

all tended to make Syracuse, not merely
more important than Gela, but potential

Mediterranean power. Such had been
the dream of Hippokrates, and that
dream was now realized by Gelon. He
enlarges and fortifies the city, and
multiplies the population, by the wholesale
transfer of citizens from Kamarina,
Gela, Megara, Euboia. Room had to
be found for this mass of men. The
‘Cavallar&lt;*&gt;-Holm’ view is that the
immigrants went to fill up gaps on Achradina,
that the quarter Tycha was
added by Gelon, and that the lower part

This statement is, indeed, remarkable:
does it preserve incidentally a reminiscence
of a previous war of Gelon's with
the Carthaginians, or is it a rhetorical
confusion, in which the impending war
with Carthage is anticipated (c. 165
<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), or should it lead us to antedate
that war so as to make it precede the
embassy of 481 B.C.? This last alternative
is to be rejected. (1) The synchronism
between the invasions of Greece
and of Sicily is a very strong tradition,
and (2) was probably not accidental but
part of a general plan and combination
between Xerxes and Carthage, which,
if historical, guarantees in turn the
synchronism; cp. c. 165 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Have
we then simply a piece of idle rhetoric
here in which Hdt. or his authorities
confusedly antedated the coming war&lt;*&gt;
Hdt. can hardly have done so, he must
take two different wars to be intended,
as he specifies both; and the particularity
and character of the request of Gelon
has a very strong air of verisimilitude.
We must therefore take the reference
to be to an entirely distinct war. But
there is hardly room for the great
invasion &lt;*&gt; Sicily in 480 B.C. and a
previous Punic war since the accession
of Gelon, nor is any such elsewhere
reported, to say nothing of his time
having been fully filled by his wars
already related. What then is the

<pb n="221"/>
solution of the problem? The reference
may be to a Punic war under Hippokrates,
a dim report of which has come down
to us and which is here transferred to
Gelon, who may, indeed, have taken an
aetive and a prominent part in it, but
was not in a position to negotiate, at
least as principal and sovran, with the
Greeks of the mother-country. Cp.

and (one may add) of Hdt.'s insouciance
in sueh matters. The occurrence of the

such minutiae. Cp. Introduction, §§ 7, 8.
Materially this passage is caleulated to
enhance the significance of the attempted
foundation of an ‘Herakleia’ by Dorieus

As to the matter, four reasons are

ancient stock, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxaio/taton e)/qnos parexo/menoi</foreign>

immigrants or vagrants (like every other
Greek people), but still in possession of
their original habitation (while Syracuse

<foreign xml:lang="greek">polupla/nhton ka/rta</foreign> 1. 56); (4) of
Homeric fame for furnishing a man best

may be an indirect and delicate reference
to Themistokles in the Homeric citation,
and the Atheuian position—apart from
mere punctilio, characteristic as that is

and fourth reasons. In regard to the
first, Gelon had made his dazzling offer

potential forces of Greece; the question
had been of getting them in, not of

may seem hypercritical, until we discover
the same metaphor used with entire
proprietyas is twice recorded in Aristotle:
<title>Rhet.</title> 1. 7. 34=1365A <foreign xml:lang="greek">*periklh=s to\n e)pita/fion

Aristotle twice fathers this <foreign rend="ital">bon mot</foreign> upon
Perikles. It does not occur in the
Funeral Oration in Thuc. 2. Did
Thucydides fail to report correctly?
Without prejudging that question,
Perikles may have used the phrase in an
oration after the Samian war (439 B.C.),
or another. But was Gelon then the
author of the phrase, and that in a
bungling application. afterwards corrected
by Perikles? Or has Hdt. or his
authority transfeired the <foreign rend="ital">mot</foreign> from the
Athenian orator to the Syracusan despot?
Or was the metaphor as old as the hills,
and in use for ages before Gelon and
Perikles (cp. <foreign rend="ital">ver sacrum</foreign>)? Aristotle's
citations do not favour this fancy; he
plainly thinks Perikles the inventor of
the phrase. Hdt. is quite capable of mixing
his metaphors; cp. c. 152 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
As he transfers a meal-bag from the
starving Chians to the homeless Samians
in 3. 46, so here he has robbed Perikles
to enrich Gelon. Rose, indeed (<title>Hat
Herodot sein Werk selbst herausgegeben?</title>
p. 17), denies all connexion between
Herodotus and Perikles in regard to this
phrase: such a negation were hard to
verify! and even if established, would
not prove Gelon guilty of the ‘derangement
of epitaphs.’ A similar metaphor,
correctly used, is to be found in Eurip.
<title>Suppl.</title> 447-9, and (in Athenaeus 99 d)

Can this Skythes be any other than the
‘king’ of Zankle, whose story is told in
6. 23 f.? He had invited the Ionians,
about the close of the Revolt in 494 B.C.,
to come to Sicily and make a new home
for themselves (an out-post for Hellas)
at ‘Kale Akte’; and the Samian
oligarchs accepted the invitation, by
possessing themselves of Zankle itself
in their host's temporary absence. For
the loss of Zankle, his suzerain, Hippokrates,
punished Skythes, its ‘monarch,’
by internment at Inyx: thence he
escaped, and made his way &lt;back&gt; to Asia
and to the court of King Daieios (was
that before the b. of Marathon?). He
died, at an advanced age, at the Persian
court, whether in the reign of Dareios
oi of his successor the story does not
record, and he enjoyed—at least in the
eyes of Dareios — a reputation for
righteousness (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dikaiosu/nh</foreign>) above all
Greeks at the Persian court, in that
he had (like Demokedes!) obtained the
king's leave to go west (to Sicily) on
condition of returning, and had (unlike
Demokedes!) kept his word.</p>
<p>The passage (6. 24) leaves something
to be desired in lucidity; but there is
nothing in it to compel us to regard the
visit to Sicily in c. 24 as subsequent to
the exercise of his kingship in Zankle,
nothing to prevent our seeing in the
whole Sicilian adventure of Skythes in
c. 23 an episode in his expedition to
the west. In short, Skythes paid only
one visit, not two visits, to Sicily, where
he seems to have taken service with
<pb n="228"/>
Hippokrates of Gela, and to have acted
as his commandant in Zankle, and to
have forfeited his Sikeliote master's
favour by the loss of the town. Perhaps
his reputation for ‘righteonsness’ at the
Persian court, or with the Persian king,
was hardly deserved: but for his misadventure
over Zankle, and his escape
from Inyx, he might have ranked, in
Dareios's mind, with Demokedes and the
rest.</p>
<p>A further problem arises from the
words <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ndra *kw=|on</foreign> and the data of the
next chapter, <foreign rend="ital">q.v.</foreign> Meanwhile, whether
the Skythes of this passage and the
Skythes of 6. 23, 24, whether the father
of Kadmos and the brother of Pythogenes,
are two different persons, or one and the
same, Hdt. was equally bound to take
note of the problem, which his materials
and methods have generated. The total
absence of any cross relerence here is
astounding: it is perhaps the most
frappant of all such cases of Hdt.'s
insouciance. Complete independence of
the Sources alone will hardly account
for it; but the oversight would be easier
to understand if this passage were of
much earlier date in composition than
that; cp. Introduction, §§ 7, 8.</p></div>

(ii.) the abdication of the same; (iii.)
the acquisition and settlement of Zankle

<foreign rend="ital">tendenzios,</foreign> pragmatic; and the problem
of his father's position and identity is
obscure. Altogether we have in this
brief excursus or note upon Kadmos (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(

one of the prettiest little problems in

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">paradeca/menos para\ patro\s

<pb n="229"/>
‘tyrant’ in Kos before him? Did the

The presumption is in favour of an
affirmative to both questions, but the
language, especially in relation to the
second question, is not conclusive. The
father might have abdicated in the son's
favour. <foreign xml:lang="greek">parade/komai</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">-de/xomai</foreign>) is not a
common word in Hdt.; cp. 1. 17 <foreign xml:lang="greek">paradeca/menos

the more usual word for royal or family

<p>If, then, Skythes of Kos and Skythes
of Zankle are one and the same person,
we must suppose that Kadmos succeeded
his father by the latter's abdication or
withdrawal. But why did Skythes
withdraw from Kos? Was it to go up
to Susa with King Dareios, perhaps after
the ‘Skythian’ invasion, like Histiaios?
To Susa he certainly went at some
time; cp. c. 163 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></div>

coloured; (ii.) <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)/xeto e)s *sikeli/hn</foreign>; (iii.) the
circumstances of the time make against
it. Kadmos of Kos went off to Sicily
apparently about the time of the ‘Ionian
revolt’: the <foreign xml:lang="greek">deinou= e)pio/ntos ou)deno/s</foreign> is a
little too bold! What part the tyrant
of Kos played in the Ionian revolt is
purely a matter of conjecture. Was he
among the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/llous suxnou/s</foreign> arrested by
Iatragoras on behalf of Aristagoras at
the outbreak of the Revolt, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tura/nnwn
kata/pausis</foreign> in 499 B.C.? cp. 5. 37: in
which case he was handed over by
Aristagoras to the Koans, and by them
generously dismissed, and — <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)/xeto e)s
*sikeli/hn</foreign>. Or did he hold on throughout
the revolt? if so, on which side? Did
he emulate the rôle of Aristagoras (5. 37
<foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gw| metei\s th\n turanni/da i)sonomi/hn e)poi/ee
th=| *milh/tw|</foreign>)? while his father, Skythes,
perhaps, was the understudy of Histiaios &lt;*&gt;
Or was it only with the close of the
Ionian revolt that Skythes found Kos
too hot to hold him? It is easy to
speculate: impossible to decide: but at
least it is evident that the voluntary
abdication in favour of democracy, from
a sheer sense of political justice, when
the tyranny was firmly established, and
there was no circumstance to cause
him disquiet or apprehension, is not the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth—is not even plausible fiction.</p></div>

which Stein dismisses contemptuously

authority as hosts of readings which he
has accepted elsewhere <foreign rend="ital">passim.</foreign> The
reputation of Kadmos (already not quite

of the preposition and interpretation of
the verb. It we read <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ *sami/wn</foreign>, then
the verb <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sxe</foreign> must mean ‘seized’ as in

as the leader of that very band of

parricide? Or was it, perhaps, a very
deep-laid plot, to which the father was
a consenting party? He had abdicated
once before in favour of his son; and it
was time for him now to be returning to
Susa (where he had a reputation to
lose!). He paid in any case for the loss
of Zankle by his imprisonment at Inyx:
but even this imprisonment has a makebelieve
air, and the conduct of Hippokrates,
his offended suzerain, is curiously
paradoxical. He accepts the situation
at Zankle, makes a bargain with the
treacherous Samians, and be&lt;*&gt;ays the
Zankleans: meanwhile Skythes escapes
from Inyx, goes to Himera, and from
thence to Asia and the Persian court,
where he died in the odour of sanctity.</p>
<p>Reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ tw=n *sami/wn</foreign> with the
‘elder’ MSS. may work a transformation
in the later stages of the story of Kadmos,
at least if <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sxe</foreign> must still mean ‘seized,
captured, forcibly occupied.’ But must
it (as Stein assumes)? <cit><bibl n="Soph. Aj. 663">Soph. <title>Aias</title> 663</bibl>
<quote xml:lang="greek">ou)/pw ti kedno\n e)/sxon *)argei/wn pa/ra</quote></cit> shows
that in the phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">sxei=n para/ tinos</foreign> the
verb may mean little more than <foreign xml:lang="greek">tuxei=n,
de/casqai</foreign>, or simil. This interpretation
would not of necessity alter in any
substantial paiticular the hypothetical
history just sketched: the action of the
Samians is emphasized, but Kadmos
might still be of their company, and
even their leader. If, however, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sxe</foreign> be
taken in the strongest sense, the meaning
of the sentence <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sxe para\ *sami/wn</foreign> is
widely different: Kadmos deprives the
Samians of the city, or at least of the
government, of which they have deprived
his father. It is from this point of
view that Stein reconstructs this part of
the story. According to him Kadmos is
employed by Anaxilas of Rhegion, and
supplied with the means to attack and
recover the town from the Samians, who
have come to terms with Hippokrates,
and thus broken with Anaxilas. Kadmos
carried out his commission (against the
Samians—and Hippokrates?) successfully,
and settled there (<foreign xml:lang="greek">katoi/khse</foreign>)—
as Stein now thinks (cp. next note).
But unfortunately for this interpretation
(1) Thucyd. in recording the expulsion
of the Samians by Anaxilas (6. 4) says
nothing about Kadmos. (2) If Kadmos
was a protégé of Anaxilas, how does he
come afterwards to be the trusty henchman
of Gelon, who was sworn foe to
Anaxilas? The first difficulty Stein
meets by the supposition that ‘the rôle
of Kadmos was a subordinate one’ (what
then of Hdt.?); the second by the
supposition that Anaxilas afterwards put
Kadmos on one side, dropped him in
fact: but why? Neither objection holds
against the other view: if Kadmos was
leader, or companion, or friend of the
Samians, he would naturally have been
driven out of Zankle by Anaxilas with
the Samians, and no less naturally
sought the protection of Gelon after
that contretemps.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">katoi/khse</lem></app>, “incoluit” Valla, “habitavit”
Schweighaeuser, so too L. &amp; S.
Stein in his earlier annotated editions
took it to mean ‘made a colony of,’
‘supplied with a new population,’ and
this well suits his interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\
*sami/wn e)/sxe</foreign>: but in the fifth edition
substitutes the other (and correct) interpretation,
which, however, obviously
<pb n="231"/>
suits the reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ *sami/wn</foreign> or the
weaker meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/sxe</foreign> if <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ *sami/wn</foreign>
is read.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*za/gklhn th\n e)s *messh/nhn metabalou=san
to\ ou)/noma</lem></app>. Does the tense
here certainly mean that the name of
Zankle had been cbanged to Messene
before its ‘seizure’ by Kadmos, as Stein
asserts? (1) This is to give too inevitably
a ‘pluperfect’ meaning to the
aorist. The past time of the aorist may
be relative to the writer, or relative to
the thing (event) narrated: the strict
pluperfect should be confined to the
latter relation. Why should Hdt.,
whose pluperfects are sometimes relative
rather to the time of writing than to
the subject matter of the record, be
supposed in using the freer aorist to
adopt a strictly <foreign rend="ital">plus quam perfectum</foreign>
date? Why should not Hdt. have
written <foreign xml:lang="greek">metabeblhkui=an</foreign> here if that was
his meaning? It may be admitted that
if it were otherwise demonstrable that the
change of name had preceded the advent
of Kadmos, the aorist might be interpreted
accordingly: that it must be so
interpreted is an over-statement.</p>
<p>(2) The phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lin *za/gklhn th/n ktl.</foreign>
is curiously clumsy if Messene was
already the name of the city when
Kadmos arrived: it should have run
<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lin *messh/nhn th\n e)c *za/gklhs metabalou=san</foreign>
(or <foreign xml:lang="greek">metabeblhkui=an</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ ou&lt;*&gt;/noma</foreign>,
in which case the aorist would have
naturally involved a  <foreign rend="ital">fait accompli.</foreign></p>
<p>(3) Stein's interpretation flatly contradicts
Thucydides, who expressly affirms
that the name was changed by Anaxilas
after the expulsion of the Samians: 6. 4. 6
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s de\ *sami/ous *)anaci/las *(rhgi/nwn tu/rannos

a)po\ th=s e(autou= to\ a)rxai=on patri/dos
a)ntwno/masen</foreign>. That might seem to settle
the question; but the coinage of
‘Dankle-Messene’ appears to suggest
that in reality the name Messene was in
use for the town, or at least by the town,
before the expulsion of the Samians by
Anaxilas. See B. Head, <title>Hist. Num.</title> p.
134, who expresses himself, however,
cautiously: “the following coins with
Samian types (if they are in reality
Samian) would seem to prove that the
name of Messene was in use at Zancle
while the Samians were still in occupation.”
(Only some of the coins are
inscribed.) Cp. also A. J. Evans in
<title>Numism. Chron.</title> xvi., 1896, p. 104;
G. Tropea, <title>Numismatica Messano-Mamertina,</title>
1902. Now, if Thucydides is wrong
to this extent, that “the name of
Messene was in use at Zankle while the
Samians were still in occupation”—
possibly in compliment to Anaxilas
before he expelled the Samians—yet
still that does not prove that it was
in use before the appearance of Kadmos
on the scene—unless his appearance is
identical with the expulsion of the
Samians (a view combated above).</p>
<p>(4) Freeman, <title>Sicily,</title> ii., Appendix IX.
<title>Anaxilas and the Naming of Messana,</title>
while interpreting these words rightly
to mean that “the city which was called
Zankle when Kadmos settled there was
called Messene when Herodotus wrote,”
traverses the statement of Thucydides
from another point of view. (1) The
motive given for the change of name is
“somewhat singular and sentimental.”
(2) Diodoros used the name Zankle for
the city down to the death of Anaxilas
(476 B.C.), and afterwards down to the
expulsion of his sons and the general
settlement of Sicily, when he changes
the name to Messene. (3) This settlement
coincides with the third Messenian
war: Messenian exiles may have settled
then in Zankle and changed the name.
But Freeman has overlooked the coins
with Samian type and ‘Messenian’
legend. Moreover, the connexion of
Messenians with Rhegion and (probably)
Zankle goes back to the first Messenian
wars, as he shows i. 586. Yet his idea
that the final change of name was not
fully or officially recognized till about
460 B.C. is plausible enough.</p></div>

an immense armada from Carthage. In
Hdt. this coincidence is presented as
purely fortuitous, and the invasion

in alliance with Gelon against the
Carthaginians and the Greeks who
‘phoenikized,’ Terillos, Anaxilas. It
appears that the Chalkido-Ionian elements
were supporting themselves by
barbarian help (Carthage, etc.) against
the Dorian; and so later on Athens
succeeded to the same fatal policy in
Sicily. Hamilkar in 480 B.C. represented,

early made this name known in the

Thucydides, no doubt on the authority
of earlier writers, represents the Ligyes
as having expelled the Sicani from (a
portion of) Iberia, 6. 2. 2. In the Latin
writers and writers of the Roman period
the Ligurians extend from Spain into
North Italy (cp. Livy 5. 35), and geographical
nomenclature (sinus Ligusticus,
Lugudunum, Liger, Liguria) attests the
extension of the &lt;*&gt;ce (cp. Kiepert,

<title>Manual,</title> §§ 213, 254, etc.). To the
modern ethnologist the Ligurian name
represents a primitive stratum of population,
the main seats of which lie all
along the littoral from the Pyrenees to
the Apennines, and which penetrated a
considerable way beyond the latter barrier
into the Italian peninsula, if not beyond
the former into the Iberian (cp. Nissen,

this vast yet vagne total (devoid of

It agrees only too well with his estimate
for the army of Mardonios, 8. 113, 9.
32; cp. also c. 185 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Bnt the
figures are heie of less importance
than the composition and leading of
the forces. In the seven races, or
nations, massed under the command of
the Carthaginian we may see a coalition
of the western Euro-African peoples,
under Semitic lead, to destroy or expel
the Hellenic intruders. How far the
army so composed is an army of Carthaginian
subjects, and how far a purely
mercenary force, recruited voluntarily,
is a further question. (See next note.)
The Italian, or at least the Sabellian
stocks are not present. Rome was at

(cp. Polyb. 3. 23; StrachanDavidson,

two errors, or inaccuracies, in this
description:—(1) The father's name.
Trogus Pompeius (Justin 19.1) represents
this ‘Hamilkar’ as the son of Mago,
‘Karthaginiensium imperator,’ and the
brother and successor of Hasdrubal.
Meltzer, <title>G. d. Karthager</title> i. 193, prefers
the later and Latin authority, upon the
ground that the data in Trogus represent
the results of conscious and consistent
research, while the patronymic in this
passage is merely an <foreign rend="ital">obiter dictum</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">bloss
aphoristische Erwahnung</foreign>): the name
here may also be a mere textual corruption.
Diodorus unfortunately (11. 20)
does not give the father's name. Trogus
gives Hanno as the name of one of the
sons of Hamilkar. (2) The kingship.
Was the Constitution of Carthage in
480 B.C. monarchie, or did it even include
any magistrate to be properly described
as <foreign xml:lang="greek">basileu/s</foreign>? This question Meltzer (<foreign rend="ital">op.
c.</foreign>) answers in the negative. Diodorus
<foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> describes ‘Amilkon’ as elected
General (<foreign xml:lang="greek">strathgo\n ei(/lonto</foreign>). Trogus <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>
speaks of Mago as <foreign rend="ital">imperator,</foreign> and of
Hasdrubal (the elder son) as <foreign rend="ital">dictator</foreign>
eleven times, dying of a wound in
Sardinia, after handing over the <foreign rend="ital">imperium</foreign>
to his brother. On the death of
Hamilkar Carthage is ruled for a time
by the <foreign rend="ital">familia imperatorum,</foreign> until a
court of 100 senators (<foreign rend="ital">centum ex numero</foreign>
<pb n="235"/>
<foreign rend="ital">senatorum iudices</foreign>) is elected to enforce
responsibility on the commanders, and
respect for the constitution. The Latin
terminology and Roman analogies somewhat
detract from the authority of
Trogus, but his account is consistent with,
or even suggests, an oligarchic or aristocratic
state in which one house, or family,
has tended to exercise or &lt;*&gt;surp a dynastic
position.</p>
<p>The oldest description of the Carthaginian
Constitution is Aristotle's (<title>Politics</title>
2. 11=1272 b), on which cp. F. L.
Newman, <title>Politics,</title> ii. Appendix B, pp.
401 ff. and O. Meltzer, <title>G. d. Karthager,</title> ii.
2<hi rend="sup">tes</hi> Buch (pp. 3-152). See also B. W.
Henderson on ‘The Carthag. Councils,’ <title>J.
of Phil.</title> xxiv., 1896, pp. 119 ff. Aristotle's
description may be taken as valid in the
main for a long period—perhaps centuries
—prior to his time. He classes it with
the ‘Kretan’ and ‘Lakonian,’ and
especially notes that there has been no
<foreign xml:lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> and no <foreign xml:lang="greek">tu/rannos</foreign> in Carthage; also
he especially notes the analogy between
the kings (<foreign xml:lang="greek">basilei=s</foreign>) at Sparta and the
kings at Carthage, but to the advantage
of the latter, as elective and not
hereditary. This observation coupled
with Livy's comparison of the Carthaginian
‘suffetes’ to the Roman consuls
(30. 7. 5 etc.) may be taken to show that
there were two supreme magistrates at
Carthage, <title>Shophetim</title> = ‘Judges,’ but what
the limit of their term of office is not
clearly shown. But that either or both
of the <title>Shophetim</title> took supreme command
in the field, <foreign rend="ital">ex officio,</foreign> is not stated, nor
is it (<foreign rend="ital">me iudice</foreign>) probable for this period,
whatever the earlier arrangement may
have been. Meltzer has well explained
the significance of the military reform
which Trogus enables us to associate
with the name of Mago; it consisted in
the substitution of an army mainly
subject, or mercenary, for an army mainly,
or exclusively, citizen soldiers. The
first historic example of its employment
is at Himera in 480 B.C. With the new
organization of the militia may have
gone a development of the command, to
which we might refer the language
by Isokrates put into the mouth of
Nikokles (Newman, p. 403) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti de\

than a difference and independence of

overthrew an ‘oligarchy’ according to
Aristotle, <title>Pol.</title> 8 (5). 12. 13=1316a.
Strabo in his account of Rhegion (257)
quoting Antiochos (a first-rate anthority)
would lead us to infer that the oligarchy
was ‘Mcssenian,’ Rhegion being a
joint foundation of Chalkidians (Ionian)
and Messenians (quasi-Dorian). It is
perhaps by an error that Herakleides
Pontikos 25 makes Anaxilaos himself a
‘Messenian,’ even though Thucyd. 6. 4
seems to anticipate it; at any rate the
policy of Anaxilaos is ‘Chalkidic,’ philIonian,
or at least anti-Syracusan. Cp.

the younger of two sons, and has apparently
three grown up sons of his own

In 530 B.C. the Gamoroi had not yet

Hamilkar's mother must (one supposes)

rule, only a small part of the animal
was consumed by fire, and the greater
part was eaten by the worshippers. On
this occasion there was nothing of the
Feast in the Sacrifice, which was all
offered to the God, evidently in the hope
of procuring a favourable answer, divine
assistance or intervention, on behalf of
the Carthaginian arms. Even if this
story be substantially true, we need not
picture Hamilkar neglecting his duties
as commander-in-chief in order to devote
his whole mind to these continuous
burnt-offerings.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w)=se e(wuto\n e)s to\ pu=r</lem></app>. Human
sacrifice was especially in vogue at
Caithage; cp. Justin 18. 6. 11 “ciuenta
sacrorum religione et scelere pro remedio
usi sunt; qu&lt;*&gt;ppe homines ut viciimas
immolabant,” etc. (Flaubert employs this

<foreign rend="ital">motif</foreign> with terrible effect in his romance
<title>Salambô.</title>) Hdt.'s narrative may record
not an act of despair but an act of
devotion: the rout was not complete
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ginome&lt;*&gt;nhn</foreign>) when Hamilkar, in the act
of pouring libation over the last victims,

<pb n="238"/>
thrust himself into the blazing pyre, in
hopes and faith that this supreme sacrifice
would wring a favourable intervention
from his god. (Cp. c. 107 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>) Baehr
and Blakesley both approve this idea.
Hamilkar's fortunes were probably staked
on the success of this expedition: he
could remember, perhaps, the reception
of the defeated army on its return from
Sardinia under ‘Maze&lt;*&gt;s’ (Justin 18.
7) and had no mind to risk a worse
reception. But this ‘Carthaginian’
legend (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s *foi/nikes le/gousi</foreign>) of his selfsacrifice
may not pass unchallenged into
history: the alternative version of his
death, though less romantic, is more
probable in itself, and creditable to him
as a soldier. Cp. <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p></div>
<div type="commline" n="10">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ei)/te e(te/rw|</lem></app>: probably as in the story
<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> <bibl n="Diod. 11.20">Diodor. 11. 20</bibl>, according to which
Hamilkar was cut down early on the
day of battle as he was engaged, in the
naval camp, on a sacrifice to Poseidon,
by Syracusan cavalry, who, under a ruse
of Gelon's devising, had made their way
into the lower Carthaginian laager. In
some respects, while the account of the
campaign as a whole, and of the battle,
given by Diodoros, no doubt ultimately
from Sikeliote sonrces, is very much
fuller and more articulate than the curt
and rather incoherent account here given
by Hdt, the story of Hamilkar's death,
as given by Hdt. (‘so striking in itself,
so thoroughly Semitic, and so effectively
told’), is hard to part with, and might
be combined, as Freeman suggests, with
the main story as told in Diodoros; and
indeed more effectively than Freeman
realised, for there is no need to abandon
Gelon's ‘stratagem,’ or to move the
burning of the ships from morning until
evening, if we may preserve the sacrifice
as one not to ‘Poseidon’ but to ‘Baal
Moloch,’ and move Hamilkar from the
naval to the upper camp.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="11">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">oi( qu/ousi</lem></app>. Hdt. adduces the
heroic cult of ‘Hamilkar’ as evidence
for the truth of the story of his devotion
and death. Such it might be, if the
cult itself were a fact; but such a cult,
in Semitic and Carthaginian settlements,
Meltzer (i. 215), followed by Freeman
(ii. 521), regards, no doubt rightly, as
an impossibility. Hdt. has apparently
confused ‘Hamilkar,’ ‘the servant of
Melqart’ (Ebed-Melqart), with the god,
to whom no doubt temples existed in
all Carthaginian settlements, and the
greatest in Carthage itself.</p></div></div>

Kretans would have been applied to on
this occasion (Lyktos, Gortyn, etc.);
but if so, their answer reveals their
complete adoption of the ‘Minoan’

Hellas proper, and Peloponnese. The
isolation of Krete during the ‘Hellenic’
period offers an extraordinary contrast
to the prommence and importance of
the island and its culture in Mykenaian
or in ‘Minoan’ times. That the whole
of Krete acted on this occasion as one
state, or communion, is not credible;
but apparently no Kretan city, of any
race or origin, was officially represented
on the Hellenic side in the Persian war;
there may, however, be some ground
for the statement in Ktesias 26 that

there follows a legend of Minos, which
may have belonged to this Book in its
earlier form, but, if so, has received some
notable additions and retouches at a
later time, perhaps at two subsequent
periods, after Hdt.'s migration to the
West. Cp. note at the end of chapter.</p>
<p>Sophokles made the death of Minos at
Kamikos the subject of a tragedy (cp.
Nauck, <title>Trag. Gr. Frag.</title> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kami/kioi:
*mi/nws</foreign>), and no doubt the story had
been worked by poets and logographs
before him: the legend was to the
effect that Minos demanded the extradition
of Daidalos from Kokalos, king of
Kamikos, was hospitably received by
him, but treacherously murdered by
the king himself, or by his daughters,
in a bath. His body was recovered by
the Kretans, who accompanied him, and
they founded Minoa, and built a
splendid tomb in his honour. (Cp.
<bibl n="Diod. 4.79">Diodoros 4. 79</bibl>—where the story is
told with many later contaminations.)
Whether this story is older than the
Dorian colonization of the south side of
Sicily may fairly be doubted; it forms
a justification for the Kreto-Rhodian
invasion of a kind everywhere paralleled
in the legends of Greek colonization;
and again exhibits the wholesale appropriation
of prae-Dorian cults and
traditions in Krete by the Hellenic
stocks. Minos is no doubt a divine
person, and the double of Zeus himself:
but his legend also represents historic
events, conditions, and forces long
anterior to the Hellenic period. It is
quite certain that in Mykenaian, in
Minoan times, Krete and ‘Sicania’ were
not unknown to each other; and it is
possible that the legend of the expedition
of Minos to the West may rest on
transfigured traditions of movements
antedating not merely Hellenic colonization
but even Phoenician settlements in
Sicily.</p>
<p>An historicised account of the rise of
Minos to power in Krete is given by
Hdt. 1. 173.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kata\ zh/thsin *daida/lou</lem></app>: Daidalos
is the transparent personification of the
artist or craftsman, the maker of <foreign xml:lang="greek">dai/dala</foreign>
(<bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.60"><title>Il.</title> 5. 60</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.179">14. 179</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.227"><title>Od.</title> 19. 227</bibl>; cp.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">daida/leos, daida/llein</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">et sim.</foreign>). It would
be in accordance with the archaeological
evidences, now accumulated by Dr. A. J.
Evans, that the eponymous artist, the
master of Minoan if not of Mykenaian
craftsmen, should be at home in Krete
and at Knosos. Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.590"><title>Il.</title> 16. 590</bibl> ff.),
without actually calling him a Kretan,
locates his most celebrated work (the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">xo/ros</foreign> made for Ariadne, on which cf.
C. Robert's truly historical article <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Pauly-Wissowa, <foreign rend="ital">s.v.</foreign> Daidalos, iv. 1998)
in Knosos. But it also speaks volumes
for the early proficiency and importance
of Attic arts and crafts that the name
of Daidalos is actually located in Attica
and attached to the soil, as eponym of
the Deme <title>Daidalidai.</title> Naturally, in the
period from which the mythical and
legendary story of Greece, as we have
it, dates, the Attic and the Kretan
‘Daidalos’ are identified, and Attica is
represented as his original home He,
the jealous master, after there slaying the
too brilliant apprentice (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ta/lws</foreign> Diodor.,
perhaps <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pe/rnic</foreign> Sophokl.) escapes to Krete,
becoming the servant of Minos, until
again (by Pasiphae's aid) he makes his
way to Sicania. His ‘flight’ provokes
the ‘search,’ in the course of which
<pb n="243"/>
Minos assures himself of the presence
of Daidalos in the island (at Kamikos)
by his royal host's success in passing a
thread through the labyrinthine whorls
of a shell: thereupon, the murder of
Minos. To put an end to Daidalos we
must hark back to Lykia, where (according
to Alexand. Polyhist. <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Steph. B.
<foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dai/dala</foreign>) he died from the bite of
a snake as he was passing through a
marsh, and was buried (should he have
drained it?) at ‘Daidala,’ a city raised
in his honour. There are several cities
of the name, and perhaps each had a
tomb of Daidalos, as doubtless the
Attic Deme of the Daidalids. Cp.
Toepffer, <title>Attische Gen.</title> 165 ff., who
strongly asserts the Attic origin of
Daidalos (in ignorance of the prehistoric
arts of Krete), but happily notices the
connexion of Daidalos with Hephaistos
(cp. Pindar, <title>Pyth.</title> 4. 59; Plato, <title>Alk.</title> i.
121 A).</p></div>

Before it was Sicania the name of the
island was <foreign xml:lang="greek">*trinakri/a</foreign>, cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 6.2.2-5">Thuc. 6. 2. 2-5</bibl>.
The invasion of the Sicels (from Italy)
Thuc. dates ‘nearly 300 years before
the coming of Hellenes to Sicily,’ i.e.
by the conventional chronology 735+
300=1035 B.C., but the Sicels of course
did not at once give their name to the
island, and the delay might account for
the name <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sikani/h</foreign> occurring in ‘Homer’
(to wit, in a late passage, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.306"><title>Od.</title> 24. 306</bibl>,
and only there: presumably=Sicily);
to whom nevertheless <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sikeloi/</foreign> are known,
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 20.383"><title>Od.</title> 20. 383</bibl> (as slave-dealers), but whether
in ‘Italy’ or in ‘Sicania’ is not apparent
(and as slaves in Greece itself:
<cit><quote xml:lang="greek">gunh\ *sikelh\ grhu/s</quote> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.211"><title>Od.</title> 24. 211</bibl></cit>, 366, 389).
The Sicani, according to Thuc., were themselves
immigrants from Iberia, though
claiming to be autochthonous; but he
ventures on no date for that immigration.
Niebuhr long ago suggested that the
difference between ‘Sic-ani’ and ‘Sic-uli’
was a difference of degree, not of kind;
cp. also Nissen, <title>Italische Landeskunde,</title>
i. 548. How untrustworthy Thucyd.'s
theory is may be seen in his statement
that the previous name of the island
was Trinakria. The one thing certain
about the Homeric <foreign xml:lang="greek">*qrinaki/h</foreign> is that it is
not Sicily; nor could a Greek name for
the island (meaning ‘the Triangular,’
or ‘the Three-caped’) possibly be the
primitive name (nor is it likely that
‘triquetra’ was its ‘name’ then; cp.
<bibl n="Lucr. 1.717">Lucretius 1. 717</bibl>, <bibl n="Hor. S. 2.6.55">Horace, <title>Sat.</title> 2. 6. 55</bibl>).
Hdt. in fact is probably right in not
going behind the name ‘Sikania’ for
the island as a whole.</p></div>

If the men of Polichne and
Praisos took no part with Minos, then
presumably they were no subjects of his.
Polichne was near Kydonia (<title>Kanea</title>) but
not on good terms with it (in 429 B.C.);
cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 2.85.5">Thuc. 2. 85. 5</bibl> (though possibly
friends with Gortyn). Praisos, at the
east end of Krete, still bears the same
name, and was undoubtedly an Eteokretan
city (cp. Pashley, <title>Travels in Crete,</title> i.
290), and has recently been the scene
of excavations by the British School;
cp. <title>The Annual of B.S.A.</title> viii. This
excommunication of the Eteokretans
proves how completely the Dorian, or
Hellenic, elements had appropriated the
past with the present. In the legend
followed by <bibl n="Diod. 4.79">Diodoros 4. 79</bibl> the Kretans
who accompanied Minos to Sicily made
good his death. That is Greco-Sicilian

The ‘Messapians’—as near neighbours
of Tarentum—are the most frequently
mentioned division of Iapygians in the
Greek writers; cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 7.33.4">Thuc. 7. 33. 4</bibl> (where
they appear to be under a ‘dynast’ or
chieftain): Polyb., Strab., etc. Their
Kretan origin is a fiction ranking with
the Arkadian origin of the neighbouring
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*peuke/tioi</foreign> (Dionys. Hal. 1. 13) and the
Argive (Diomedeian) origin of the
‘Daunian’ cities in Apulia (Strabo 284).
Cp. H. Nissen, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> 542 f. The fiction
points, however, to two facts as necessary
to account for it. (1) The Messapians
were older residents in the land than
the Hellenes. (2) They had a cognate,
though more archaic or primitive, culture.
But even the ‘Messapians’ found in
occupation, and subdued or expelled, an
earlier (Italic) folk, the Ausonii (Dionys.
Halik. 1. 22); cp. Nissen p. 544. The
real origin of the ‘Messapians’ is to be
sought in the Greek peninsula, where
Thucydides recognizes Messapians in
Ozolian Lokris, 3. 101. 2. The ‘Kretan’
parentage of the ‘Bottiaioi’ through
Messapia enforces the conclusion; cp. c.
123. 18 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The two shores of the
‘Ionian’ sea had a cognate population
long before the coming of the ‘Hellenes’

a kind of metropolitan position, but it
can hardly have been an earlier ‘Messapian’

for example. The other Messapian cities
are scarcely known to fame. Strabo
281 gives the number as thirteen in
the most flourishing days. (Cp. for
nomenclature Forbiger, <title>Geogr.</title> iii. 751 ff.,
without any adequate attempt to distinguish

names or settlements.)</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*taranti=noi</lem></app>. The men of Taras,
or Tarentum (cp. 4. 99) were accounted
Dorians or quasi-Dorians of Sparta
(“Lacedaemonium Tarentum,” <bibl n="Hor. Carm. 3.5.56">Hor. <title>Od.</title>
3. 5. 56</bibl>), but the purity of their Dorism
was confessedly doubtful, and tradition
hints also at an ‘Achaian’ element (from
Sybaris and Kroton) in the foundation
(<foreign rend="ital">circa</foreign> 705 B.C.). The legend of the
‘Partheniai’ is reported by Strabo 278 f.
in two versions, from Antiochos, from
Ephoros; the latter version making them
in effect better Lakedaimonians, better
Dorians. No stronger contrast could be
devised than that between the austere
Spartan discipline and the luxury of
‘molle Tarentum,’ already proverbial in
the time of Hdt. (cp. 6. 127 and 1. 24).
The Tarentines were no doubt Hellenes,
and from Peloponnese, perhaps from
Lakedaimon; but the ‘Dorian’ element
in them was surely very small—Dorians
could ill be spared by the conquerors in
Sparta. Tarentum was a ‘Messapian’
before it was a ‘Lakedaimonian’ settlement,
and the Peloponnesian hellenized
Tarentines aimed at exploiting or subduing

Notwithstanding the immense but undefined
losses of Tarentum on this
occasion, the power of the Messapians
declined and that of the Hellenes
continued to increase thereafter: the
loss affected the inner more than the
external relations of Tarentum. (About
510 B.C. there had been a tyrant or
‘king’ at Tarentum, 3. 136.) Aristot.
<title>Pol.</title> 8. (5.) 3. 7=1303 A explains the
conversion of the city from <title>Politeia</title> to
democracy by the losses of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gnw/rimoi</foreign>
on this occasion; and no doubt the
influence of the ‘Pythagoieans’ was
destroyed. Hdt. has probably exaggerated
the actual numbers, but such were
the resources of Tarentum that it could
well sustain the blow; Strabo <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> puts
the land forces of Tarentum, under the
extreme democracy, at 30,000 foot, 3000
cavalry, 1000 ‘hipparchs.’ Why is

‘fancies’ that he was an Arkadian of
Tegea who had come to seek his fortune

of Mikythos lasted apparently some ten
years till 466 B.C. (<bibl n="Diod. 11.66">Diodor. 11. 66</bibl>), in
Rhegion and Messene (where Kleophron
had predeceased his father). The disaster
in Messapia (473 B.C.) does not appear to
have weakened his position: perhaps it
did not fall chiefly upon his own supporters.

Hieron of Syracuse to demand of Mikythos
an account of his stewardship (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)paith=sai

and themselves to assume the reins of
government. Mikythos acquits him of

beg the just steward to resume authority.

‘after taking up his abode at Tegea in
Arkadia.’ Howlong he lived there Hdt.
unfortunately does not say, but probably
he survived, not merely the death of
Hieron (466 B.C.) and the fall of the
<foreign rend="ital">tyrannis</foreign> in Syracnse (465 B.C.), but likewise
the expulsion of the sons of Anaxilaos
from Rhegion and Messene 461-460 B.C.
(<bibl n="Diod. 11.76.5">Diod. 11. 76. 5</bibl>) and the general pacification
of Sicily—to which he had, at
least indirectly, contributed; and then
died full of years and honours, leaving a
<pb n="247"/>
handsome property to his son. (Cp.
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>)</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)ne/qhke e)n *)olumpi/h| tou\s pollou\s
a)ndria/ntas</lem></app>. A description of these, with
express reference to this passage, is given
by <bibl n="Paus. 5.26.2-5">Pausanias 5. 26. 2-5</bibl>, where upwards
of a dozen large statues (some of them
forming groups) are enumerated; others
from the same donor had been removed
by Nero, before Pausanias' time.</p>
<p>Pausanias understands Hdt to say
that the offerings at Olympia were made
after Mikytho&lt;*&gt; had taken up his abode
at Tegea; an&lt;*&gt; this statement, whether
right or wrong, is (<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign> Freeman ii. 545)
the plain meaning of the words (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">oi)kh/sas
a)ne/qhke</lem></app>). Pausanias thinks it wrong,
because the dedications not merely gave
his father's name butalsonamed ‘Rhegion
and Messene on the straits’ as the fatherland
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">patri/s</foreign>) of Mikythos, but said
nothing about his residing at Tegea. It
is, however, conceivable that the son of
Choiros might have preferred to go down
&lt;*&gt;o posterity as the citizen of RhegionMessene
rather than as the metic of Tegea.
It is also conceivable that Hdt. has
made a mistake, and that the statues
were dedicated while Mikythos was still
governor of Rhegion-Messene: Freeman,
indeed, holds that “the offering is much
more like the act of a ruler than that of
a private man,” and that “the inscriptions
show the statues to have been dedicated
while the two cities were in his charge,”
ii. 545. If so, that would settle the
date of the name ‘Messene’ (for ‘Zankle’)
in a sense adverse to Freeman's own
argument; cp. p. 231b  <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p>Pausanias adds that the Olympian
dedications of Mikythos were made in
fulfilment of a vow for the restoration of
a son to health. Such a dedication
might be a private one: but does the
remark apply to any of the statues save
the Asklepios - Hygieia group? And
need all the statues necessarily have been
dedicated at the same time?</p>
<p>Hdt.'s reference to these statues prove&lt;*&gt;
them to be celebrated in the Greek world
at the time of writing: years no doubt
have elapsed since the date of dedication:
Mikythos himself is prohably no more
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n *tege/ais th=s *)arkadi/as katebi/wsen e)painou/menos</foreign>,
Diodor. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>). Hdt. had probably
seen the dedication at Olympia,
perhaps on his way to or from the west
(cp. 4. 195), and he may have got the
patronymic from the Olympian dedication.
But his main interest in this
<foreign xml:lang="greek">parenqh/kh</foreign> is the Tarento-Rheginc episode,
in the account of which the note on
Mikythos might itself be an insertion.
If so, we have in the passage the three
<foreign rend="ital">strata</foreign> of composition. I. The original
‘Kretan’ <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>. II. The western <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign>.

enough to show that the mere word could
not by itself be taken to prove the
digression, or excursus, of younger composition
than the main story, or text.
On the other hand, granting that the
passage on Tarentum in c. 171 appears to
be from a different source, and to belong

fortified, or discredited, by a transparently
fraudulent epigram, that Idomeneus
and Meriones were buried in
Knosos, and enjoyed heroic honours:
though he contradicts himself by having
made Meriones follow the first flight of
Kretans to Sicily: 4. 79. Hdt. here
seems to be acquainted with the rudiments
at least of the saga, underlying
<bibl n="Verg. A. 3.121-3">Vergil, <title>Aen.</title> 3. 121-3</bibl>, 400 f., which represented

<p>The cause of his expulsion is explained

Minos; the second, by the famine and
plague after the Return of Idomeneus.
Hdt. does not clearly state that there was

courae well aware that the <title>Iliad</title> nowhere

placed Dorians in Krete: 19. 172 ff.
The Kretan ethnography of that passage
relates itself to the Kretan history
in Hdt. as follows. Minoan Krete
is represented in Homer by Eteokretans
and Kydonians, in Hdt. by
Polichne and Praisos. The Pelasgoi and
Achaians of Homer correspond to the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/lloi te a)/nqrwpoi kai\ ma/lista *(/ellhnes</foreign>

must have been immense, not merely

Hellenes, of that passage, while
sending envoys to Korkyra and Sicily, to
Argos, and to Krete, in the hopes of uniting
Hellas against the Barbarian, leave the
Thessalian question wholly unconsidered?
Yet the initiative here appears to come
from the Thessalians, in the form of
an application to subscribe, or to be
defended by, the already formed Confederacy.
This representation may be
erroneous: the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ggeloi</foreign> here introduced
are really perhaps <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign>, the Thessalians
having been admitted already to
the Symmachy, the Council of which is
here simply discussing ‘the plan of
campaign’; perhaps this is the same
session of the Council as that which
despatched embassies to Sicily and Krete,
the Thessalians themselves being parties
thereto. This story, which appears to
be from an Athenian source, is favourable
to the Thessalian commons, and may

the second draft of the Book; cp.

these words with obvious reference
to the list in c. 132 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> which, however,
really belongs, or may belong, to a
much later point of time than he should
here have in view. The ‘second medism’
of the Thessalians is recorded in c. 174

of Thessaly. If the suggestions above
made are sound, the second is the one
and only medism of the Thessalians as a
<foreign xml:lang="greek">koino/n</foreign>. Hdt., however, represents the
Thessalians as having ‘medized’ under
compulsion in the first instance, though
what form the compulsion took he fails
to specify; he infers the compulsion,
however, from the appearance of Thessalian
envoys at the Isthmos, which he
dates subsequently to the first medism,
though somewhat inconsequently, as
soon as ever they had news of Xerxes'
project; see below. The second medism
he apparently regards as voluntary
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">proqu/mws ou)d' e)/ti e/ndoiastw=s</foreign>). His
logic would here seem to be at fault.
The abandonment of Thessaly by the
Hellenes was a much more coercive aot

other words, confirms the conclusion
that this whole story of the Thessalian
undertaking is later in composition
than the bulk of these Books. It might
have been on artistic grounds that Hdt.
postpones the account of the Makedonian
kings to the personal entrance of
Alexander on the scene; but the alternative
explanation also accounts for the
phenomena, and is confirmed by so
many other indications that it rises to
the dignity of proof. Cp. Introduction,
§§ 8, 9.</p>
<p>Were these <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)/ggeloi</lem></app> mere ‘messengers,’
or were they envoys, ambassadors,

negotiators? Was no attempt made by
the Greeks to detach Alexander from
the Persian, or to induee him at least to
play the Persian false in his passage of
the mountains? If the Makedonians
could have been induced to cut off the
Persians from behind, to assail them in
the rear, while the Greeks and Thessalians
attaeked, or defended, in front, what
might not have been effected? Alexander
was <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/cenos</foreign> of Athens (cp. 8. 136).
Alexander was manifestly well disposed
to the national cause (<foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)/noos e)fai/neto e)w\n
o( *makedw)n</foreign> just below): the absurd
message here put into the mouth of his
envoys was hardly of his dictating.
Themistokles may well have endeavoured
to obtain the co-operation of Maked on;
the loyal co-operation of Makedon might
have rendered Hellas and Thessaly
secure. We can hardly suppose that
Alexander took his cue from Argos; but
his Persian connexion was strong (8.

disposed towards Athens and Sparta
than towards the Thessalians.</p></div>

Greek expedition to Thessaly is represented
as a purely land-force, though
conveyed thither by sea. The Persian
fleet, if unopposed, would assuredly
have rendered the position at Tempe
quite untenable, even if no other pass
into Thessaly had existed. But it is
hardly conceivable that the Greeks were
ignorant of the naval preparations on the
Asiatic side; and only discovered, on
their arrival at Tempe, and through the
message from Alexander, that the king
had a great fleet in motion. It is, however,
conceivable that they were not
yet fully assured that the king's fleet
was all coming round by the north
Aegean route. The Persian fleet might
have been expected to follow the old
island route, by Delos, and to strike
direct at Athens. It was only after the
rendezvous at Doriskos that the Greeks
could feel quite sure that the king's
forces might not act independently, and
compel them likewise to separate fleet
and army, if they were to defend
Thessaly, or even northern Greece.
The assurance that the king's land-and
sea-forces were to act in strict concert.
advance by one route, and remain in
touch, Themistokles probably obtained
by his visit to Tempe, and perhaps
through the medium of Alexander.
These considerations would, however,
tend to throw some doubt upon the
exact date of the expedition given in
the next c.</p></div>

<pb n="254"/>
from Upper Makedonia could not issue
by Gonnos, and a pass by Gonnos could
not lead into Upper Makedonia. Gonnos
is itself in the pass of Tempe, and the
starting-point, or terminus, of a difficult
mountain ronte, between the land entrance
of Tempe and Lower Makedonia,
or Pieria, and stands in the same
relation to Tempe as Anopaia to Thermopylai;
but it is hardly credible that
‘the army,’ or even any part of the
army, of Xerxes actually traversed this
difficult route. It was not by this route
that Alexander in 336 B.C. turned the
position of Tempe: he led his army
past the gorge, cut steps up Ossa, and
descended into the plain behind the
enemy. Cp. Bury, <title>Hist. of Greece.</title> ii.
329. The only pass leading from Upper
Makedonia into Thessaly is the Volustana,
or Servia, from the upper valley of the
Vistritza (Haliakmon) down to Elassóna:
it is quite possible (and probable) that
one of the Persian columns used this
pass. The third main pass neither starts
from Upper Makedonia nor ends at
Gonnos, or anywhere near it; but it
may nevertheless, as Rawlinson (iii. 142
n.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>) suggests, be the one here intended
(so far as Hdt. can be said to intend one).
The Petra pass starts (like the Tempe
route) from Dion, and crosses the
Olympic range (deserving especially the
title <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( e)sbolh\ h( *)olumpikh/</foreign> c. 172) by
Petra to Doliche (<title>Dúklista</title>), descending
to Pythion and so to Oloosson (Elassóna).
From Oloosson the plain of Larissa
would still have to be gained by various
passes through the lower range of
mountains, which now form the political
frontier of Greece, and leave Thessaly
strategically at the mercy of the Turks;

The real reasons for the evacuation of
Thessaly were, (1) the failure to secure
the co-operation of Makedon; (2) the
manifest divisions among the Thessalians,
so that even a united Thessaly was too
much to hope for; (3) the assurance
that the Persian fleet was advancing
side by side with the Persian army,
rendering Tempe untenable by a landforce
alone; (4) perhaps the discovery
that there were several other passes by
which Thessaly could be entered from
Makedon, or at least the assurance
that the Persians were so numerous as
to make a diversion of that kind
easy to them. The difficulty, indeed,
is not to understand why the Greeks
abandoned Thessaly, but to explain how
they ever came to think of defending it.
They must have hoped for the co-operation
of Makedon, or at least for an
absolutely united Thessaly; they must
have under-estimated the land-force of
Xerxes, and also, probably, have believed
that the fighting fleet was not accompanying
the land-army. The visit to
Tempe enlightened them on the attitude
of Makedon, the condition of Thessaly,
the magnitude of the Persian forces, the
king's plan of campaign. But the expedition
had probably not been in vain.
It was an earnest of the resolution of
the Confederates to draw the first line
of defence as far north as possihle: it
enabled Themistokles to take stock of
and to survey the north Euboian channel
and Thermopylai: it assured him of
the king's exact designs. He returned
to the Isthmos—the Athenian ships and
men will presumably have put in to
Phaleron or Peiraieus—with a perfectly
clear view of the right plan of defence.</p></div></div>

This index of time is probably not

To have occupied Tempe when the king
was still in Asia, at Abydos, would
have been an unnecessary providence.
Moreover, it was only after the rendezvous
at Doriskos (<cit><quote xml:lang="greek">e)ntau=qa metepe/myato

assurance about the king's fleet could
have been conveyed to the Greeks (see

<pb n="255"/>
will more probably have coincided with
the king's arrival at Eion, at Akanthos,

immediately to the last words of

at Alos in c. 173 can hardly be the
‘Hellenes’ who discuss the plan of

hoplites are too many, and the two
strategoi are too few! But the question
arises whether by the ‘Hellenes’ here
are designated the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/bouloi th=s *(ella/dos</foreign>
left apparently sitting in c. 172, or a new
body, a new entity, the strategoi, or the
synedrion of strategoi. The following
reasons decide this question in favour of
the probouloi. (i.) The plan of defence
is too important a matter to have been
decided except by the Council of the
Confederacy, especially as it involved not
merely strategic but political interests
and issues. (ii.) There is no such thing
as ‘the synedrion of strategoi’ (<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign>
Busolt, ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 667; cp. <title>Lakedaimonier,</title>
407 f.). There appears in the story of
Salamis subsequently a Council of
Strategoi, that is, of Admirals; but where
then were the strategoi of the landforces?
There appears in the story of
Plataia something approaching to a
Council of War in the camp of Pausanias;
but where are the admirals?
Nowhere does a single Board or Council
of Strategoi make its appearance determining
the general plan of campaign.
(iii.) The Councils of War which do
appear are advisory, not executive. This
is true even of the story of Salamis in
which ‘voting’ is talked of, for Eurybiades
is clearly supreme to act according
to his own judgement. Equally certain
is it that Pausanias acts as commanderin-chief
at Plataia, Leotychidas at
Mykale; and at Plataia and Mykale the
plan of campaign has been settled long
before. The discnssions in the fleet (9.
106, 114) practically lead to a schism;
but Leotychidas may be considered to
have acquiesced in the action of the
Athenians. (iv.) The formal hegemony
of Sparta in the war favours the view
that no single Board of Strategoi met to
decide the strategy of the campaigns.
Either Sparta decides the plan at home
and leaves her commander and her
navarch to carry it out (with such
advice as each may take separately in
emergencies from a Council of War), or
else the general plan of campaign, embracing
the operations by sea and by
land, is discussed and settled by the
‘Hellenes,’ i.e. by the probouloi of Hellas
(who may of course in many cases be
strategoi too), and the hegemony of
Sparta is restrieted to the actual conduct
of operations subject to the general
scheme agreed on. The latter view
seems to suit the facts and stories best.
What, for example, but the <foreign rend="ital">dogma</foreign> of
<pb n="256"/>
a general Synod of Probouloi could have
decided the Athenians, who had resolved
<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n ba/rbaron de/kesqai th=|si nhusi\ pandhmi/</foreign>
(c. 144), either to send 5000 hoplites to
Thessaly in 480 B.C. or 8000 hoplites
to Plataia in 479 B.C.? See further,

The introduction of these words has the
effect of making it appear that the
Greeks had no plan of campaign before
their visit to Tempe. Yet the subject
must surely have been considered before
the expedition to Thessaly, perhaps by
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/bouloi th=s *(ella/dos</foreign> who are
brought to the Isthmos, or detained there,
in the spring of 480 B.C. according to
the previous story (c. 172), if not by the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/bouloi</foreign> at the meeting in the previous
autumn. It may be that these words
are a clever piece of Herodotean dovetailing
introduced by him, after the
insertion of the Tempe story (cc. 172-174),
to rationalize the perspective, with
the result that the discussion on the
first line of defence has perhaps been
thrown out of gear, or at least brought
down to a later point than was explicitly
fixed in the first draft of the work. Cp.
Introduetion, § 9.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tt=| te sth/sontai to\n po/lemon kai\
e)n oi(/oisi xw/roisi</lem></app>. This is the fundamental
question of the defence. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th=|</lem></app> is
not a simple locative (making <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n oi(/oisi

(Schweighaeuser) <foreign rend="ital">instituri sint bellum?</foreign>
The locality would to some extent depend
upon the mode, and the mode upon the
locality. There was plainly an obstinate
contest on these cognate problems, for
the plan adopted is a ‘victorious’ one
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">h( nikw=sa gnw/mh e)gi/neto</lem></app>), not, indeed,
over the Persians, but over an opposition
in the Council or Synod. Whose was
the victorious plan? Doubtless the
Athenian's.</p></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th\n e)n *qermopu/lh|si e)sbolh\n

for the plan, in which Artemision is as
vital a point as Thermopylai. Hdt.
thus unwittingly heralds the Spartan
prejudice which dominates the story
of Thermopylai. The rationale for the
decision betrays the same obsession.
The despatch of the fleet to Artemision
is added as an independent item, recommended
by the consideration that
Thermopylai and Artemision were near
enough to admit of information passing
from one to the other. In reality, of
course, the defence of the line ArtemisionThermopylai
is strategically one and
the same operation, conditioned by the
fact that the attack is directed simultaneously,
interdependently, and unilineally
on sea and land.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">steinote/rh <gap/> th=s e)s *qessali/hn</lem></app>.
This would seem to compare the relative
widths of Thermopylai and Tempe: the
comparison seems to imply that the
occupation of Tempe was in debate,
and was rejected on the ground that
(1) it was a wider pass than Thermopylai,
(2) further from their home-bases, (3)
liable to be circumvented, (4) out of
touch with the fleet. On all these points
Thermopylai had the advantage, and
therefore Thermopylai-Artemision was
chosen as the first line of defence in
preference to Tempe. There would have
been no sense in mentioning ‘the pass
into Thessaly’ in this connexion unless
its merits had been discussed in comparison
with Thermopylai. It would
follow that the discussion here indicated
arose before the decision to occupy Tempe.
It is possible that the plan (for
Artemision-Thermopylai) represents the
original plan of campaign; or that the
plan was to defend Thermopylai, and
the station of the fleet at Artemision
was only determined on after it became
known that the king's fleet was accompanying
the king's army, i.e. after
the occupation and abandonment of
Tempe. In that case, what was now
decided was not so much to defend
Thermopylai as to defend Artemision in
connexion with Thermopylai.</p>
<p>But <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th=s e)s *qessali/hn</lem></app> is capable of
another interpretation: it might refer,
not to the pass from Makedon into
Thessaly, but to the pass from the
south, across Othrys, into Thessaly; not
to the Tempe but to the Phurka. The
<pb n="257"/>
Othrys-line was a possible line of defence,
which is nowhere contemplated in Hdt.,
and indeed plays a curiously small part
in ancient warfare, perhaps from the
very proximity of Thermopylai, but
which yet might have had to be
considered on this occasion. The debarkation
at Halos, instead of Pagasai,
c. 173 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> seems to relate itself more
naturally to a reconnaissance at Thaumakoi
(Domoko) than to a reconnaissance
at Tempe, to a defence of Pharsalos than
to a defence of Larissa.</p></div>

For the description of this path see c.
212 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> The statement here is one
of those very hard to stomach. On
general principles, the Greeks, of all
peoples in the world, would have known
that there is always a second pass, or a
way round a mountain, sooner or later;
and even if they knew nothing of the
existence or character of this particular

would surely be able to turn Thermopylai.

is narrowest it is but 50 ft. wide, but
that there are two other spots in the

may be guilty of this error in common
with all his commentators hitherto.
Certaiuly his description is confused and
obscure. But it is just possible that
he intends to say what he probably
ought to have said: ‘the pass <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign>
Trachis is in its narrowest part less
than 50 ft. wide, but the pass <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Thermopylai

<p>The immense change in the contour

of Hdt.'s description to the pass
of Thermopylai as it presents itself to
the eyes of the modern traveller (e.g.
<foreign rend="ital">ipsius mei,</foreign> 9th April 1899); but the
inner wall of the pass, so to speak, the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/ros a)/bato/n te kai\ a)po/krhmnon, u(yhlo/n</foreign>,
has altered but little in two thousand
years; it is the sea which has ficd, vastly
extending the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tena/gea</foreign> and allnvial deposit,
allowing the lowland to advance,
altering the courses of the rivers, and
largely destroying the picturesqueness
of the scene. Yet, thanks mainly to
the inner frame of rock, it is possible
to think away the accretions and alterations
and to restore the physiographical
conditions as they were in 480 B.C., and
now more easily than ever before, thanks
to the map based upon the accurate
survey of Dr. G. B. Grundy. See his
<title>Great Persian War.</title></p>
<p>The description of Hdt., though incorrectly
‘oriented,’ reproduces the main
strneture and featuies of the scene, as
it was in his time. The pass of Thermopylai
then lay between a precipitous
mountain and the land-locked sea—such
was its peculiarity, like the Klimax in
Pisidia (cp. Arrian, <title>Anab</title> 1. 26, Strabo
666), but, unlike the Klimax, it was at
no time rendered actually impassable
by tide - water. The pass consisted,
further, of three parts or sections: the
western gate, the eastern gate, both
extremely narrow, and a wider amphitheatre,
or rather two half-amphitheatres,
lying between them. The western gate
is formed by the projection of a mountain
ridge, or spur, which descends with
an accessible slope towards the sea, its
extreme point being abruptly cut off
(perhaps in part by human ageney) so
as to form a sheer but not lofty cliff,
below which curved the road, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(macito\s
mou)nh</foreign>, for some considerable distance.</p>
<pb n="260"/>
<p>The ‘city’ of Anthela may have been
situate on the slope, or lower plateau
(no/wadays crowned by the remains of a
Turkish barracks), commanding this
passage, though the words of Hdt. rather
suggest a site for Anthela outside the
passage or the Gates proper. The
Phoinix certainly flows just beyond
the gate, now into the Spercheios, at
one time formerly into the Asopos
(Strabo 428). Beyond, or west of this
river, the plain extends, ringed round
on the left by a great circle of cliffs,
and hills and mountains (as not badly
described c. 198 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). This western
gate, however, is ill to defend, as the
projecting spur of mountain forming it
might easily be attacked and crossed
from the west or Trachinian side.</p>
<p>At the other or extreme eastern end,
distant about four E. miles or more by
road, the cliffs and mountain wall again
sweep forward and decline to the sea,
and form another ‘gate,’ a little in
front of the probable site of Alpenoi, as
narrow of yore as the western (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a(macito\s
mou/nh</foreign>), perhaps even narrower, and
probably in itself more defensible, being
backed rather than fronted by the hill,
and only to be turned by a force that
should have made its way right round
behind the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/ros a)/bato/n te kai\ a)po/krhmnon</foreign>
on the left, inland. A path, however,
ascends in front (W.) of this gate, and
strikes across the projecting ridges or
spurs of the mountain to join the
Anopaia route, to and from Aipenoi;
and this ascent (which might enable a
force attacking the Eastern Gate in front
to turn the position) must be reckoned
with in any reconstruction of the story
of Thermopylai.</p>
<p>Between the Western and Eastern
Gates lies, and lay (to a less extent), a
double amphitheatre, between the mountain
and the sea, roughly comparable to
a double U (W). It is here, along the
chord of these two rough arcs, that
there is most room for doubt in regard
to the ancient line of coast. Dr.
G. B. Grundy contracts the interval
between sea and mountain-spurs about
half way between the Eastern and the
Western Gate, and recreates for 480 B.C.
a third, i.e. Middle Gate, or rather low
pass, the road deserting the level and
rising over the slopes, in order to avoid
the sea, which here for a longer space
than at the western or eastern ends is
made to wash the very skirts of the
hills. This is a feature of which no
clear account is taken in Hdt.'s description
of the pass as a whole. The West
Gate he recognizes (making it north), the
East Gate he recognizes (making it south),
but the Middle Gate, or Passage, he
does not well describe; it is, however,
at this middle gate that he apparently
locates the name Thermopylai, and so
the expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( e)n *qermopu/lh|si e)sbolh/</foreign>
may be taken to signify, in the strietest
sense, not the whole road from the
western to the eastern ends, or gates,
but the col, just about half way between
them. (But in no sense could this be
called <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( dia\ *trhxi=nos e)/sodos</foreign>, cp. l. 6

more general sense, perhaps, the mountain
above Thermopylai (Kallidromos)
might be regarded as belonging to the
Oitaian group. So Strabo 427-8 regards
Oita as extending from the Ambrakian
Gulf to the Malian (Thermopylai) and
cutting the range of Pindos-Parnassos at
right angles, the name ‘Oita’ belonging
particularly to the eastern portion of
this (rather schematic) range. Strabo's

The ‘Thessaloi’ are absolutely unknown
to ‘Homer,’ or more completely ignored
than the ‘Dorians’ themselves. (A
Herakleid ‘Thessalos’ appears in the
Catalogue, B 679, as father of Pheidippos
and Antiphos, the leaders of thirty ships
from Kos, Nisyros, Krapathos, Kasos,
Kalydnai, i.e. Asianic islands (afterwards)
occupied by ‘Dorians.’) Their migration
from Epeiros (a term first expressly found
in Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 6. 1. 7), into (historic)
Thessaly was therefore dated after the
Trojan war; and there the historic
‘Thessaliotis’ (cp. 1. 57), with its capital
Pharsalos (not mentioned by Hdt.), may
naturally be regarded as one of the chief
seats of the conquerors. The ‘Thesprotia’
from which they come was not merely
the restricted territory bearing that
name in the days of Hdt. and Thuc.
(cp. 8. 47 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), but probably coextensive
with southern Epeiros, in which
region ‘Homer’ already locates Thesprotoi
ou the sea-coast, and only clearly there
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 14.315"><title>Od.</title> 14. 315</bibl>, etc. As the Molossoi (unnamed
by Homer) are the dominant
element in S. Epeiros during the historic
period, we may infer that the Molossian
invasion (from Illyria?) burst up the
Thesprotians from the mountain to the
sea, and that the Thesproto-Thessalians
under this pressure went across Pindos
into historic Thessaliotis and Thessaly.
(To speak of Homeric ‘Thessaly,’ with, for
example, Buchholz, <title>Homerische Realien,</title>
i. 88, etc., is rather misleading, though
of course none knows better that it is
not a Homeric term; cp. i. 97 ff.)</p></div>

1. 12. 3; but he has nothing
to tell us of the local antecedents of the

apparently that the land ‘now called

‘Thrakians,’ 2. 29. 3. The Homeric

natural to bring the historic ‘Phokians’

date of the voluntary communication

(either already at or <foreign rend="ital">en route</foreign> for
Artemision), and the immortal obligation.
(iii.) <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ de\ tau=ta</foreign>, the date of
the erection of the Altar of the Winds
at Thyia, and the institution of the
Cult; but how loug after? Before

<p>That the Cult of the Winds at Thyia
dated from, or after, the Persian invasion
is plainly asserted in this passage; but
<pb n="266"/>
this new departure can hardly have
been the first institution of Windworship,
but was rather an attempt to
give Pan-hellenic significance, or at least
Delphic sanction, to much more ancient
practices. The sacrifice of the Magi to
the Wind in c. 191 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> is connected
indirectly with Ionian, or rather ‘Aiolian’
legend, and the Wmds of ‘the Thrakian
sea’ (cp. c. 176. 2 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), Boreas and
Zephyros, are Homeric personalities in
the <title>Iliad</title> (9. 5, 23, 229 f.), while in the
<title>Odyssey,</title> if they are treated with less
respect, yet Aiolos, their keeper, is a
decidedly supernatural person (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 10.1"><title>Od.</title> 10.
1</bibl> ff.). It is not, however, in the
Olympian direction that the <foreign rend="ital">origines</foreign> of
the cult is to be found: the winds,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/nemoi, a)/ellai</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">qu/ellai</foreign>, are primitively
connected with the dead, the departed
‘spirits,’ the chthonian cults. Thus
even in the <title>Patrokleia</title> Acbilles invokes
Boreas and Zephyros, <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ u)pi/sxeto i(era\
kala/, polla\ de\ kai\ spe/ndwn xruse/w| de/pai&lt;*&gt;
lita/neuen</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.195"><title>Il.</title> 23. 195</bibl> f.), and in the
legend of Menelaos preserved by Hdt.
2. 119 the winds are propitiated by
human sacrifice (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ntoma: kuri/ws ta\ toi=s
nekroi=s e)nagizo/mena</foreign> Schol. Apoll. Rhod.
quoted by Wiedemann, <title>Herodots Zweites
Buch,</title> ad l.), and though the sacrifice
of Iphigeneia is not Homeric, and is,
in its earliest litcrary form, a homage
not to the Winds, but to Artemis, yet
the Vergilian formula, <cit><quote xml:lang="la">Sanguine placastis
ventos et virgine caesa, etc.,</quote> <bibl n="Verg. A. 2.116"><title>Aen.</title> 2. 116 ff.</bibl></cit>,
probably comes nearer to the primitive
idea and cult. The intention of the
Herodotean stories seems, at first sight,
not to go much beyond raising (or
quelling) a storm, and so, indirectly,
causing a destruction of the enemy, or
<foreign rend="ital">vice versa</foreign>; but the terminology nevertheless
snggests a chthonian cult (c.
192), and the notion that the Winds are
summoned to dissipate or carry to the
underworld the ghosts of the combatants
is not to be wholly rejected. (The
chtbonian origin of the Wind-cult has
been detected and developed by three
scholars: Stengel, <title>Hermes,</title> 16 (1881),
349 ff.; Rohde, <title>Psyche,</title> 1890-4; Tumpel,

between this passage and c. 131. It is
more probable that the king was in
Therme than in Pieria until the actual
march began; and this view is supported
by cc. 128, 130, where Therme is made
his headquarters. Such discrepancies
are easily to be explained by a difference
of sources, and an indifference of the
author.</p>

Figures and facts are (in a sense) different

in regard to an immense armyservice
train in the Persian war. Had the
force of Xerxes been really composed of
Libyans, Aithiopians, and all the other

no doubt the combatants would have
had to wait on themselves; nor does
Hdt. mean that each particular combatant
had a body-servant, but that the
commissariat and service generally outnumbered
the combatants. That seems
a sound view; the absurdity and impossibility
come in with the extravagant
exaggeration of the numbers of combatants.

to obtain the number of medimnoi, the
answer is 110,067 medimnoi 4 choinikes,
which is the problem as worked by Hdt.
so that his result gives an excess of 272
medimnoi 36 choinikés. Is this error
intelligible, explicable? Schweighaeuser
perceived practically the source of the
error: Hdt. did not quite fully work
out the sum. 528 myriads of choinikes
amount to exactly 110,000 medimnoi:
so far then the first item in Hdt.'s
calculation is correct. There remain
3220 men, or rather ‘choinikes,’ to be
reduced to medimnoi. This figure divided
by 48 gives a quotient of 6 and a fresh
dividend of 340, and instead of proceeding
further with the sum and obtaining
a final quotient of 671/12, Hdt. at this point
must have substituted the dividend for
the quotient, and added it to the preceding
quotient. The source of the
error being thus revealed, the text is to
be regarded as correct: in any case
Sitzler's emendation (cp. App. Crit.)
does not benefit Hdt.</p></div>

Xerxes was unworthy his position.
Still less does he wish to pour scorn on
the myriads of men who followed the

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a(/te ga\r tou= <gap/> ou) mega/lou</lem></app>: why
is the beach so small? Perhaps merely
because the Homeric beach, in the
passage (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.33"><title>Il.</title> 14. 33</bibl> ff.) upon which
Herodotus has based this description,
is so. Evidently not the smallness of
the beach, but the tactical disposition
of the Persian fleet, kept the ships
bunched up in relatively close order.
To have formed one line along the miles
of Magnesian coast might have proved
salvation, when the unforeseen storm
burst upon them; but that line would
have left the greater portion of the fleet
further and further from their objective,
Artemision, or Aphetai. The night,
according to Hdt. himself, was a perfectly
calm one, succeeding a day evidently
as calm: the storm was a surprise,
a miracle.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pro/krossai</lem></app>: a much debated word.
at least since Schweighaeuser and Reiske
started the idea that the word here means
<foreign xml:lang="greek">klimakhdo/n</foreign>, <foreign rend="ital">par e/chelons,</foreign> ‘in quincuncem,’
‘cuneo.’ According to their idea the
Persian fleet is to be pictured as a huge
equilateral triangle, pointed out to sea
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s po/nton</foreign>) in eight rows, each row being
one ship less than the previous one
nearer shore (how many each or any one
row contained is not stated; but 1204
(1207) shipsarrangedin this fashion would
give a base of 154 and an apex of 147).
The hypothesis of so strict and elaborate
an arrangement is, upon the face
of it, improbable, and the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/krossos</foreign>
does not carry the meaning.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">kro/ssai</foreign> are projections, projecting stones,
(<bibl n="Hom. Il. 12.258"><title>Il.</title> 12. 258</bibl>), which apparently might
serve for steps (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> 444), as in Hdt. 2.
125 (of the pyramids: courses of stones,
projecting certainly one beyond the
other); but the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/krossos</foreign> seems
to be connected rather with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ko/rsh</foreign>=
<foreign xml:lang="greek">kefalh/</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kro/ssh</foreign> itself a variant), and to
mean ‘head-foremost,’ or ‘projecting’
(as in Hdt. 4. 152); and of ships, stemforemost,
which may well be its meaning
in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.35"><title>Il.</title> 14. 35</bibl>. So Portus interpreted it
here, “naves quarum prorae obversae
erant,” and was followed by Wesseling,
Larcher, Baehr, and others. He, however,
supposed that <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai( prw=tai</foreign> bad their
stems to the shore, and that there were
nine rows in all. This appears to me
to be an error. The first row was moored
close to land (probably with ropes to
shore), others rode at anchor, but all
alike <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/krossai o(rme/onto e)s po/nton</foreign>, and
there were but eight rows in all. If
the fleet is supposed to number 1200
(1207) that would give 150 vessels to
each row. Hdt. has indeed recruited
an additional squadron of 120 in Thrace,
c. 185 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>; but that is a somewhat
hypothetical figure, and would not, perhaps,
more than replace wear and tear
up to this point, even if the figure 1200
were not itself an exaggeration. Taking
the fleet at a nominal 1000, there would
of course have been (a nominaI) 125 in
each row, supposing the rows all equal,
which they need not have been. The
disposition of the fleet would be determined
partly by ethnical considerations.</p>
<p>Stein observes that the influence of
the Homeric original (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.33"><title>Il.</title> 14. 33</bibl> ff.) is
seen not merely in the use of the word
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/krossos</foreign>, but in its being made of
three terminations, while in 4. 152 it
is of only two. The smallness of the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)gialo/s</foreign>, above noticed, is an equally
telltale effect.</p>

this story in no relation to the Delphic
story, c. 178 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> which is there reported
without the least hint of misgiving.
Nor does he say that the oracle
which ‘came’ to the Athenians (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)/llou</lem></app> in
contrast to the response in c. 140, or even
that in c. 141) is the oracle ‘announced’
by the Delphians; nor could it be, for
the terms are different: <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n gambro\n
e\pi/kouron kale/sasqai</foreign> this, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)ane/moisi eu)/xesqai

that the genuine and true oracle and
story; this, an afterthought and fiction.
But the reverse is probably the truer
view. (1) The Athenian story is based
on the precedent of Athos. (2) The
terms are more oracular: the Athenians
had several sons-in-law, Tereus for example
(<bibl n="Thuc. 2.29.3">Thuc. 2. 29. 3</bibl>), or Xouthos
(Euripid. <title>Ion</title> 57 f.), not to say Apollon
himself (<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign> 10 f.), or possibly Ion, or
any hero, who had ever led or misled an
Attic bride. Thus the Athenian oracle
is sure to turn out well! The Delphic
is much blunter. (3) The Delphic oracle
is compromised by its too obviously
apologetic purpose, and by the attitude
of Delphi in the war, which was so sorely
in need of apology afterwards. (4) If, as
seems probable, this is not merely not the
Delphic publication mentioned above in
c. 178, but not a Delphic oracle at all
(rather an utterance of Bakis, 8. 20 etc.),
produced and interpreted for the occasion,
then it has all the more a ‘genuine’ ai&lt;*&gt;,
and the Delphic story all the more
appearance of an express reply to this
Attic story: Delphic  <foreign xml:lang="greek">*qui/a</foreign> besting Attic
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)wrei/quia</foreign>. Hdt. was a good friend to

3000 mares, attended by youthful fillies,
of whom Boreas becomes enamoured, and
in likeness of a dark-maned steed, the
sire of twelve (other) filhes, who could
skip over the coin-field without bending
the ears, and over the waves without
breaking the foam. The Attic mythologists
have improved on that, but
Oreithyia, ‘daughter of Erechtheus’
(Poseidon), still betrays her Nereid origin.
The etymology of the name is obscure.
It can hardly be participial. The similarity

that ‘a misfortune by which a child of

there must have been a more extensive

the doer, Hdt. would surely have put
the point clearly, and not represented
him as passive. If a madman, again,
Hdt. would not have shrunk from saying
so (cp. 6. 75). In any case we are in

That is a <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> to Hdt. as much as the

Ionians on the fleet (and not Dorians, or
‘Aiolians,’ who might have been the
best authorities of all). With Thetis,
Peleus, the Nereides, we step within the
circle of Homeric, or Homero-Hesiodic
theogony (cp. 2. 53). Thetis in Homer
is a goddess united to a mortal Peleus,
and the <title>Mater dolorosa</title> of Achilles; but
the union does not appear there to have
been effected by <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(rpagh/</foreign>: Hera sanctions
it, and the gods all attend the weddingfeast,

by the ‘Ionians’ to the Persians different
in that respect (and more like the myth
of Boreas and Oreithyia)? The Nereids,
if not Thetis herself, seem to represent
the calmer and more gracious aspects of
the sea. On the Homeric points see

As the Greeks had been praying to the
Winds to intervene in their favour (c. 178
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), Hdt. only means to express a
doubt as to the efficacy of the Persian
sacrifices and incantations, and on this

or scientifie, in his scepticism, for in
the very expression of it he manifests
an intensely anthropomorphic idea of

this passage is coneerned it might have
shifted down ehannel, or just rounded
the NW. point of Euboia (Cape <title>Lithada</title>)

in c. 183 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> the Greek fleet has

Herwerden's reading clears this point,

the Greek fleet return to Artemision

is the first actual arrival at Artemision
chronicled. Yet here ‘the second’
advent is elaborately recorded, <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)pei/gonto
e)pi\ to\ *)artemi/sion, to\ deu/teron e)lqo(ntes
ktl</foreign>. Was there any retreat at all from
Artemision? Why should the Greeks
have done more, in order to avoid the
fury of the storm, than draw up their
ships on shore? They doubtless had a
laager on shore. When the storm abated
they would launch the ships again: perhaps
the <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">nauloxe/ein</lem></app> (cp. c. 189) implies
that the ships are afloat.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="2">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*poseide/wnos swth=ros <gap/> nomi/zontes</lem></app>:
this is a very curious and glosslike
remark, standing where it does:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">nomi/zontes</foreign> does not really apply to the
same persons as <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)lqo/ntes</foreign>, nor to the
same date as <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)naulo/xeon</foreign>. The religious
service in honour of Poseidon has been
recorded, and apparently was celebrated
elsewhere than at Artemision, and before
their return thither: their return to
Artemision, and their occupation or reoccupation
of the station there is then
recorded: next, these words are added
<foreign rend="ital">à propos</foreign> of the prayers and libations
to Poseidon (at Chalkis?). The shift
of scene, the lapse of time, the change
of persons, the then and the now, throw
the gloss out of gear. Its occurrence
here would be less unnatural if the
whole scene had really been laid at
Artemision, and the Greeks had never
quitted it (but simply drawn up their
ships). The remark may be from the
writer's own hand, perhaps a later insertion,
but it is very clumsily made.</p>
<p>An actual cult of Poseidon <foreign xml:lang="greek">*swth/r</foreign> does
not appear to be here asserted, but only
a customary title, ascribed to this
occasion, though just before worship
is recorded. Even the title is not otherwise
attested, for Hom. <title>Hym.</title> 22 can
hardly be regarded as in point (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dixqa/

are we justified in crediting Hdt. with
an aceurate knowledge of the peeuliar
formation of the coast in that region,
and in particular with a clear and correct
conception of the inner landscape of the
gulf of Volo? What evidence is there
that Hdt., e.g., was aware how the eoast
lay from Sepias to Aphetae, or even
knew of the existence of the peculiar
promontory which extends SW. from
Magnesia and forms the lower side of
the Pagasaian gulf, separating it from
the Euboian channel? Hdt. appears to
think that the king's fleet rounded the
Magnesian <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/&lt;*&gt;h</foreign> and sailed right into
the gulf leading towards Pagasai. But
Aphetai was probably outside that
gulf, although Hdt. distinctly loeates
it inside. (Cp. note  <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>) Ptolemy
3. 13. 16 distinguishes <foreign xml:lang="greek">*magnhsi/a a)/kra</foreign>
and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*shpia\s a)/kra</foreign>, but this does not carry
us beyond Hdt. except that, as Prolemy
mentions also <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ai)a/ntion</foreign>, we cannot identify
the Magnesian promontory with the
point on the R. (east) as you enter the
gulf of Volo (Cape Kavulia, close to
Trikeri).</p>
<p>Hdt. does not take the Persian ships
to Pagasai; but as he takes them round
the Magnesian promontory into the gulf
leading towards Pagasai, before getting
to Aphetai, we may fairly suspect that
he coneeived the Pagasaian gulf to open
further east than is the aetual case;
and if we are to maintain the distinction,
in his case, between C. Magnesia and
Aiantion, the former might perhaps be
identified with Cape <title>Anaphu,</title> the most
prominent projection on the south coast
of Magnesia (not far from Ohzon).</p></div>

‘Pelasgiotis’ puts Pagasai in ‘Phthiotis’
—3. 13. 16, 17. (But Ptolemy does not
recognize any district of ‘Magnesia.’)
Strabo 436 (<foreign rend="ital">locus classicus</foreign>) seems to
reckon Pagasai to ‘Magnesia’ (and perhaps
Magnesia itself to Pelasgiotis), and
puts it 90 stades from Pherai (of which
it is the port) and 20 from Iolkos.
Skylax, <title>Peripl.</title> 64, 65, reckons Pagasai
under <foreign xml:lang="greek">qettali/a</foreign> and Iolkos under <foreign xml:lang="greek">*magnh=tes</foreign>,
which amounts to saying that
Pagasai is not a ‘Magnesian’ city. Considerable
remains in the neigh bourhood

According to the later, or prevalent,

Mysia, having gone to look for &lt;*&gt;s,
who had been sent for water: Apo&lt;*&gt;on.

mentioned; or possibly, without the
local specification, ‘the isthmos’ might
have suggested some place in the
neighbourhood of Artemision. Or, lastly,
it is a mere matter of sources; and if
Hdt. here follows an Asianic source the
specification is natural. Cp. Introduction,

version of the story was current at
Orchomenos, or in Boiotia, where there
was an ‘Athamantian’ plain, a shrine
of Zeus Laphystios, and various Athamanian
or Athamantian settlements (cp.
<bibl n="Paus. 9.34.5">Pausan. 9. 34. 5</bibl>). Perhaps the Boiotian
version had &lt;*&gt;ved most literary attention
before &lt;*&gt;, but it is not likely
that the Thessalian, or rather AchaioAthamanian,
was unreported until Hdt.
set it down here: the two, indeed, were
ultimately no doubt identical.</p>
<p>Aischylos, Sophokles, and Euripides
each wrote tragedies upon this theme,
and the first two probably before Hdt.'s
composition (cp. Nanck, <title>Trag. Gr. Fragg.</title>
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)aqa/mas, *fri/cos</foreign>, and the reference to
Sophokles <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 257">Aristoph. <title>Clouds,</title> 257</bibl>).
But the dramatists, of course, were not
the first to introduce the myth into
literature. The Boiotians, Hesiod and
Pindar among the poets, and Pherekydes
among the ‘logographers,’ had dealt
with the myths of Phrixos, Nephele,
Ino, Athamas. (Cp. Pherekydes, <title>Fragg.</title>
52-55, <title>F.H.G.</title> i. 86.) Hdt. does not
here agree with Pherekydes.</p>
<p>The myth, in its various forms, has,
of course, to be detached from the cult
of Zeus Laphystios, with which it has
been amalgamated, and from which it
may, in part, have been ultimately derived.
The permanent value of this
passage in Hdt. lies in its witness to
the cult.</p>

thinking that “the human offering”
was “probably not the primitive fact”
in “the Hellenic cults of Zeus.” This
view looks like a survival of the idealistic
tendency, but might be saved, even for
strict historical e&lt;*&gt;iticism, by discovering
that the  <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)aqama=nes</foreign> were not ‘Hellenes,’
and that the cult was ‘prae-Hellenic.’
Stein observes that Zeus <foreign xml:lang="greek">*lafu/stios</foreign> had,
“like the Jehovah of the Old Testament
and the Moloch and Melkart of the
Phoenicians, a right to all the first-fruits,
first-born”—mankind not excepted.
Zeus Lykaios was probably the wolt-god;
but what is there to show that Zeus
Laphystios was the ram-god? (except
perhaps the cult? cp. 1. 14 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), or that
in eaeh case the human victim is not as
primitive as the theanthropic animal?</p></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)aqa/mas o( *ai)o/lou</lem></app>: this genealogy
is Hesiodic (Fr. 25) but not Homerie.
The older tradition, or theory, made
Athamas a son of Minyas (cp. Thraemer,
<title>Pergamos,</title> 139, 141), i.e. not even an
‘Aiolian.’ Hdt. of course aecepts the
Hesiodic genealogy, by which Aiolos is
one of the sons of Hellen. (He need
not have gone direct to Hesiod therefor;
but he was not unacquainted with the
Boiotian; cp. 2. 53, 4. 32.) Escher is

<title>Gr. Personennamen</title><hi rend="sup">2</hi>, 419 (cp.

in historic times were a elearly recognizable
folk in S. Epeiros, on the western
side of Pindos, between the Molossi and
Thessaly, on the upper waters of the
Aeheloos or Inachos, who, like many of
their neighbours, enjoyed more importance,
at least for a time, during Roman
than during Hellenic history; cp. Bursian,
<title>Geogr. v. Griechenl.</title> i. pp. 39 f., Oberhummer,

According to Pherekydes, Phrixos offered

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)axaioi/</lem></app>: the significance of this

The ‘Aehaians’ in Thessaly are (in
Hdt.'s view) invaders, conquerors, newcomers
(cp. c. 196 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). This ‘Achaian’
proposition, or ordmance, therefore, represents
a new departure, and a duty
or obligation (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)/eqlos</lem></app>) imposed upon the
‘Aiolian’ stoek (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou= ge/neos tou/tou</lem></app>) for
the sins of its ancestor.</p>
<p>That Hdt. (in his source) has fully and
correetly understood the nature of the
‘Achaian’ ordinance for the ‘Aiolian’
clan cannot be admitted. Aeeording to
this aecount the Aehaians actually desire
the human sacrifice of Athamas himself
(cp. <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), and, at some subsequent
time, ordain a liability of the first-born
in the Aiolian, or Athaman, house to be
sacrificed. The truth has been inverted.
The new departure, made by the Achaians,
is plainly a limitation of human sacrifice,
not its institution; they make a way to
escape; if only a certain ‘taboo’ is
observed the victim is safe Perhaps
they go even further, and substitute a
‘pomp,’ a ‘ceremony,’ and a vicarious
sacrifice (of an animal) for the human
victim; but this is not quite clearly
indieated.</p>
<p>This eorrection of the Herodotean
account is justified (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) by the general
analysis of religious history, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) by the
myth of Phrixos and Helle itself, which
(i.) presupposes the earlier existence of
such human sacrifices; (ii.) eontains the
datum of the substituted animal (the
ram). The antitheses, however, between
Aiolian and Achaian we cannot accept
(any more than the antithesis between
Achaian and Hellenic); and though undoubtedly
Thessaly (and Boiotia) witnessed
the immigration of foreigners,
and various ehanges or mixtures of
population, the incomers will hardly
<pb n="294"/>
have been more civilized and humane
than the pre-existing population. In
any case we are not (at present) justified
in regarding the ameliorations introdueed
into the cult of Zeus Laphystios as proof
of race-differences, or as more than illustrations
of the general improvement of
ideas and institutions during the ‘Helleme’
period.</p></div>

than (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) the absence of any

visited Halos, and studied the cult
<foreign rend="ital">an Ort und Stelle,</foreign> one might expect a
less perplexing muddle.</p>
<p>Stein has found a way out of the wood.
He supposes that the first-born was bound
(if he wished to be recognized as a fellowcitizen)
to try to get in without being
caught (on his coming of age?) This
was the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)=qlos</foreign>. If he succeeded, well
and good; his franehise was secure.
But if he failed, and fell into the hands

was substituted, and the man allowed to

<p>&lt;*&gt; undoubtedly says that in certain
cases the man is saerificed, and says
nothing about the substituted ram.
Human sacrifice is well attested for
various parts of Greece in the historic
period: Ps.-Plato,  <title>Minos</title> 315 c, speaks of
the Athaman sacrifice as real and subsisting.

Rawlinson (against Larcher) denies that
there was any temple of Laphystian Zeus
at Alos, and refers this passage to the
temple in Boiotia, between Koroneia and
Orchomenos (<bibl n="Paus. 9.34.4">Pausan. 9. 34. 4</bibl>). Xerxes
heard the tale at Alos, and afterwards,
“on his passage through Boiotia,” spared
the shrine and grove in consequence.</p>
<p>Rawlinson probably is right in the
main, and that the words <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s kata\ to\

the Boiotian Laphystion. But it ean
hardly be maintained that such is Hdt.'s
meaning. He says not a word of a
Laphystion in Boiotia, and as far as his
text is concerned there is nothing to
suggest that <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ i&lt;*&gt;ro/n, to\ a)/lsos, to\ te/menos</foreign>,

Xerxes never was at ‘Alos’ (cp.

gloss: Hdt. has heard of Xerxes ‘sparing’
and ‘respecting’ the shrine of (Laphystian)
Zeus in Boiotia (cp. 8. 34, 50); he
himself associates the Athaman legend
with Halos, and has taken Xerxes thither
in order to relate it, and still more, to
deseribe the strange cult. But here he
does not speak of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ro/n</foreign> but only of an

in long measure, would amount to 420
(odd) miles, a manifest absurdity: therefore,
either the figure is wrong, or else
the measurement is square. After
<foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)ru/taton</foreign> one expects a simple measure
of length. Rawlinson challenges the
reading, and suggests <foreign xml:lang="greek">kb</foreign> (=22) as
possibly corrupted into <foreign xml:lang="greek">&lt;*&gt;k &lt;*&gt;b</foreign> (=22.000).
22 plethra would be less than half a mile.
That seems rather little even for antiquity.
Leake (so too Stein) took the
measurements here to he square: the
amount on this hypothesis would be
5025 acres. Rawlinson objects (1) Hdt.
never gives areas; (2) the particle  <foreign xml:lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>.
What <foreign xml:lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> has to say to long rather than
quadrate measure, I do not see. Stein
suggests that Hdt. gives the square
measure here, probably because the
Persian camp (c. 201) was pitched here.
This suggestion is acceptable; but
does it mean that the camp covered
5000 acres? If so, we have a kind of
criterion of the numbers of the Persian
host before Thermopylai. (Allowing
4 acres for 1000 infantry and 10 acres
for 1000 cavalry, 5000 acres would accommodate
1,250,000 infantry or 500,000
cavalry! or say, 1,000,000 infantry and
100,000 cavalry!)</p>
<p>At any rate, it leads to two further
inferences: (i.) Hdt. is here following
medizing sources (not the patriotic
southern Greek sources from which the
description in c. 176 was drawn); (ii.)
he has not obtained this measurement
from a source connected with the Spartan
foundation of Herakleia in 426 B.C.
The 5025 acres, for example, are not the
territory of the new colony (but they
might be the measurement of the

called ‘Thermopylai,’ or locally ‘Pylai’
(rather for the sake of brachylogy than
as denying the proximity of the hot
springs), than appears on the surface of
the narrative. But the term <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pixw/rioi</lem></app>
should imply ‘inhabitants,’ espe&lt;*&gt; in
distinction to  <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">peri/oikoi</lem></app>, or dwellers in
the neighbouring villages and towns.
This passage was originally quite independent
of c. 176, and of earlier composition
apparently; and the assertion of
a local variant, which ought to be the
more correct, not the less correct, name
for the place, is no proof of a personal
visit by Hdt. to the place. Is it even
quite certain that he has correctly reported
the use of the names? A third
name was certainly applied to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/odos</foreign>.
or to some part of it, viz, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ steno/n</foreign>, or
<foreign xml:lang="greek">stena/</foreign>: cp. Strabo 428 <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n me\n ou)=n pa/rodon
*pu/las kalou=si kai\ *stena\ kai\ *qermopu/las</foreign>.
The local names ought to show not less
but more precision than the language of
the Hellenes at large. The three names
admirably fit the three gates, which
local knowledge would be able clearly to
distinguish, though the Hellenes at large
could not be expected to do so. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pu/lai</foreign>
would serve for the western entrance to
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/rodos</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/odos</foreign>, a roadway winding
under the cliff for the best part of a mile:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*qermopu/lai</foreign> might be applied to the
middle gate (or <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/odos</foreign> proper), from its
greater proximity to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">qerma\ loutra/</foreign>:
while <foreign xml:lang="greek">*stena/</foreign> exactly suits the eastern gate,
which in antiquity was the narrowest
passage of the three. If this conjecture
is right, Hdt. has not fully or correctly
reported the nomenclature. The difference
is not primarily between a local
and a general usage, nor is it restricted
to the use of two terms. Full local
usage &lt;*&gt;nguished the three gates by
three &lt;*&gt;ent names. It is further
possible that for the pass as a whole,
while local usage contented itself with
the term  <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pu/lai</foreign>, Greece at large was
more apt to speak of it as <foreign xml:lang="greek">*qermopulai</foreign>.</p></div>

(ep. c. 176 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), hut this, the earlier
passage, whieh has in view simply the

does this message, or emhassy, emanate

from Leonidas, already at Thermopylai?
&lt;*&gt;rently the latter. The story seems
&lt;*&gt;t to assume that the Lokrians and
Pnokians had not been represented at
the Isthmian Congress, and were now
first summoned hy the Confederates to
their aid.  <bibl n="Diod. 11.4.6">Diod. 11. 4. 6</bibl> says definitely
that the Lokrians had given earth and
water, and were pledged to seize the
passes for the Persian; hut that on the
arrival of Leonidas at Thermopylai they
changed their mind and joined the
Greeks. The summons is highly argumentative:
the argument is thoroughly
Herodotean.</p>
<p>Three or four points in the message
or proclamation of Leonidas are notahle.
(i.) The Greek forces st Thermopylai are
only the vanguard of a large army that
may he expected any day. This item
seems relative to the idea that the forces
under Leonidas were small; without
the Phokians and Lokrians they certainly
were; and the tradition is incidentally
confirmed by 8. 40. (ii.) The sea is heing
guarded hy the Athenians, Aiginetans,
and naval powers: a point of which
the Lokrians would themselves have
ocular evidence, if this message only
dates from the arrival of Leonidas at
Thermopylai. (iii.) The invader was
human, mortal, not supernatural, not
a god—a strange point! Did the
humour of the Hellespont (c. 56 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)
require this solemn refutation? Or
would the Greeks take courage from the
consideration that ‘mortality is mixed
<pb n="304"/>
with evil, the greater the mortal, the

hut truly Herodotean. The change in
construction (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s <gap/> h(/koien, ei)=en, ei)/h</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">bis,</foreign>

the pedigree of ‘Leonidas,’ right up to

to the year 1180 B.C. The pedigree of
Hckataios was shorter (2. 143), hut the
<pb n="305"/>
sixteen generations would just take
Leonidas hack to Eurysthenes and the

<p>This pedigree is the <foreign rend="ital">ne plus ultra</foreign> use

these Herakleid pedigrees—the most
famous in Hellas—are first introduced

B.C.? Is it not because this portion
of Hdt.'s work is the oldest in composition?
Cp. Introduction, § 8. That
hypothesis would at any rate fully
sustain the fact. The Herakleid pedigree
of the Spartan kings compares
favourably with the Achaimenid pedigree
of Xerxes himself, as given c. 11 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign>
which runs, in the &lt;*&gt;t line, only into
seven generations. &lt;*&gt;ne names in the

for the succession of Leonidas: (1) he
was older than Kleomhrotos, (2) he had
the daughter of Kleomenes to wife (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=xe</foreign>).
Did Hdt. know, when he first wrote this
passage, that, according to one report,
‘Kleomhrotos and Leonidas were twins’
(5. 41)? Did he know the lady's name?
(cp. c. 239 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). The influence ascrihed
to the marriage here is remarkahie,
and the closeness of the relationship
But there is a suppressed prohlem, which
becomes apparent 9. 10 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Dorieus,
the elder hrother, had a son, Euryanax,
who must have had some pretensions to
succeed. Dorieus, indeed, had never
been king, and perhaps the ‘law’ reported
e. 3 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> was invented, or
invoked, on this occasion, though it was
far from heing of universal application
(cp. 8. 131). Anyway, there was plainly
a question over the succession on the
death of Kleomenes, hut rather, perhaps,
hetween Leonidas and Euryanax
than between Leonidas and Kleomhrotos.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pileca/menos</lem></app>: Hdt. speaks as
though Leonidas on this occasion selected
this Three Hundred men, <foreign rend="ital">ad hoc,</foreign> and
took care that they were <foreign rend="ital">pères de

is here understood by Baehr as
men ‘of mature age’ (so, too, K. O.
Mueller, Grote, and others). Larcher,
on the other hand (followed by Stein),
preferred “le corps fixe et permanent.”
The word <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pileca/menos</foreign> here looks like a
misunderstanding of <foreign xml:lang="greek">loga/des</foreign>, and also
like a heginning of the Thermopylai
legend, according to which Leonidas
went thither with his mind made up for
a <foreign rend="ital">devotio</foreign> (cp. c. 220 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), a point
further emphasized by the words next
annotated.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="9">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai\ toi=si e)tu/gxanon pai=des e)o/ntes</lem></app>:
if the previous words are understood
(with Baehr) to record correctly a special
levy or selection made hy the king on
this occasion, then these words occasion
no difficulty, as merely specifying one of
the most important conditions governing
his choice. If the Three Hundred ahove
are identified with the ‘Knights’ or
‘Cavaliers,’ then these words admit of
three explanations. (i.) It was one of
the ordinary and standing conditions of
appointment to the rank of ‘cavalier’
to have a son. This is not improhable.
The Cavaliers were the king's hodyguard,
and it was necessary that they
should die for him in extremities—which
they would he the more ready to do if
they had sons to succeed them in Sparta.
(ii.) Or it might he supposed that upon
this occasion, though the Cavaliers are
the <foreign rend="ital">corps d'élite</foreign> referred to, yet those
who were not <foreign rend="ital">patres</foreign> were on this occasion
weeded out, and their places taken hy
<foreign rend="ital">patres familiarum.</foreign> This compromise is
surely very unlikely, and objectionahle,
<foreign rend="ital">inter alia,</foreign> as a concession to the Thermopylai
legend above specified. (iii.)
The words do not refer to the Three
Hundred, hut to others, seleeted in addition
to them. This interpretation would
imply a larger number of Spartiates at
Thermopylai than Hdt. includes in the
army-list, perhaps the Thousand of
<bibl n="Diod. 11.4">Diodoros 11. 4</bibl>—not, indeed, in itself a
fatal ohjection. We should simply have
the Thermopylai legend still, in one
degree more developed towards its
&lt;*&gt;oreian form. But then  <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pileca/menos</foreign>
would apply only to the second set,
though that again is not a fatal ohjection.
The simplest interpretation is, however,
the hest. The Three Hundred in question
were the <foreign rend="ital">hippeis,</foreign> and went with the
king as a matter of course; hut Hdt. has
a little misunderstood the arrangement.

the Persian fleet and army were

The price is set upon his head by the
Pylagoroi when he is already in exile:
this act can best be connected with the
Lakedaimonian revival of the Amphiktyonic
League, which followed the
Athenian organization of the Delian confederacy,
and can hardly be dated before
476-475 B.C.; cp. c. 228 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Perhaps
the abortive proceedings of Leotychidas
in Thessaly were not unconnected with
the extradition of Epialtes (cp. 6. 72);
and the subsequent fates of Leotychidas
and of Pausanias, together with the
general depression of Sparta, which lasted
nearly a quarter of a century, may have
encouraged Epialtes to return to his own
land. His death may be dated some
years after his crime. He fell a victim
apparently to a private, or local, feud;
but the Spartans at least regarded him
as <foreign rend="ital">iure caesus,</foreign> and ‘hououred’ the
assassin. They did not, indeed, give
him the Spartan franchise (cp. 9. 35),
but perhaps they gave him a great reception
(cp. 8. 124), and saw that he was
paid the Amphiktyonic reward.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="7">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(po\ tw=n *pulago/rwn</lem></app>: the Pylagoroi
have been regarded as the Amphiktyonic
Board charged especially with the conduct
of political or secular matters, while the
<title>Hieromnemones</title> had charge of sacred or
hierarchic questions (cp. in modified
form K. F. Hermann's <title>Lehrbuch</title> i.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> p.
98 f.); but Cauer (<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Pauly-Wissowa i.
1922 ff.) has shown the untenable character
of this distinction, and assigns, at
least down to Aito&lt;*&gt;an times, the administration
of the Delphic temple to
the  <title>Hieromnemones,</title> but all the jurisdiction
of the League to the Pylagoroi.
The evidence for this conclusion is chiefly
from the fourth century, but the present
case would suit therewith. Anyway the
<title>Pylagoroi</title> were presumably the older and
the original Board, dating from a time
before the Amphiktyons had charge of
Delphi, and when their only meetings,
in spring and in autumn, took place at
Thermopylai. So naturally the Pylagoroi
were charged with thesacrifice for Demeter,
Strabo 420 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/quon de\ th=| *dh/mhtri oi( pulago/roi</foreign>).
The exact number of Pylagoroi
appears doubtful; Athens apparently
elected three in the time of Aischines (c.
<title>Ktesiph.</title> 115). That would give a total
of thirty-six, if each of the twelve
members had equal rights. The representatives
were perhaps appointed only

problem of Hdt.'s composition. The
work of Hdt. is certainly finished and
complete, and it might well be supposed
that he simply forgot this pledge. But
that supposition hardly meets the case;
for the promise itself appears to imply
that Hdt., when he wrote this passage,
contemplated bringing down his work to
a chronological point subsequent to the
assassination of Epialtes. He has not
done so; and yet his work is complete.
His original plan must, therefore, have
undergone some modification, for the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/pisqe lo/goi</foreign> here will scarcely have
designated a separate work, or supplement.
When Hdt. started his first work,
the history of the invasion of Xeixes, he
may have intended to bring the story
down into fully contemporary history,
or at least down to the death of Xerxes.
But this intention suffered a great change
when he determined to narrate, not the
sequel, but the antecedents, of the invasion
of Greece. He was thus led by
degrees to alter and extend his conception
and plan, so as to include finally
the treatise on Egypt, Bk. 2, which has
even less to say to the main argument of
his work than the promised but never
written <title>Assyrian Logoi</title> might have had.

as more attractive. Thorax the Thessalian,
and the two most important men
in Trachis, Kalliades and Timaphernes,

reasons are not conclusive. It is not
the action of the Pylagoroi (who mostly
came from medized states) so much as
the inveterate hostility of Sparta that
argues Epialtes the wretch who betrayed
Leonidas and his men; yet that might
have been a colourable excuse for a
hostility based on other causes. Hdt.'s
second argument is still poorer, for (1)
he has represented Epialtes' exile as
having preceded, at least, his condemnation
by the Pylagoroi (notwithstanding
Stein's emendation; cp. App. Crit.); (2)
he shows that Epialtes had a desperate
feud with another powerful man in

the fuller form in giving a deliberate

is remarkable to find deserters coming
over to the Greek side at this crisis.
They would report the despatch of the
force from the Persian camp. Their
arrival is dated during the night. No
doubt a council of war, if not already in
session, was instantly summoned (cp.
Diodor.), and not, as Hdt. might seem to

It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the
dramatic felicity of this triple warning;
but it is impossible to suppose that deliberations
in the Greek camp were postponed
until the arrival of the scouts.
Measures had been taken, or concerted,
or at least discussed, during the night.
Diodoros, indeed, 11. 9 (that is, Ephoros)
represents Leonidas as dismissing the
Greeks soon after midnight, retaining
only the Thespians, who raise his force
to 500. With this band he makes a desperate
night-attack on the Persian camp,
and effects great slaughter, penetrating
even to the tent of Xerxes; but with
the advent of light the paucity of the
foe is perceived, and the Greeks are surrounded
and overwhelmed. The last
day's fight is briefly and badly paraphrased
from Hdt. The night-engagement
looks like pure fiction; but the
force of Persians that has circumvented
the Greeks disappears at the critical
moment from the pages of Diodoros as
from the narrative in Hdt.</p></div>

state the facts in inverse order: some
(the majority) were for going, others
(the minority) resisted, opposed, and—
remained; for the ‘schism’ was not
apparently one merely of opinions or
plans. The facts that some remained
and were slain, that others departed, are
no doubt historical; but Hdt.'s report
of the council of war, of the division of
opinion, of the bare alternatives presented,
can hardly be regarded as final.
Surely some device, some proposal with
a definite bearing upon the general plan
of campaign, as well as upon the immediate
situation created by the prospective
circumvention, must have been discussed.
The path was known, and the possibility
of its being used by the Persians already
considered (cp. cc. 175, 217). The Greek
commander and officers must have already
thought on what was to be done, in case
the Persians attempted to force this path,
<pb n="324"/>
and succeeded; nay, they must also have
taken into account the possibility that
the Persians would circumvent them by

could not, indeed, supersede the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(gemoni/a</foreign>

lay with him. Hdt. plainly does not
know what the decision of Leonidas was,

death as an act of personal gallantry,
perhaps ‘devotion,’ with his own men.</p></div>

story explained the retreat of some of
the troops, the larger portion, and the
retention of others, the lesser portion,
or that there was any alternative explanation
possible, does not seem to
have occurred to Hdt. He appears to
think that Leonidas would have had
the whole forces under his lead stay and
share his inevitable fate; and the more
the better. The solid fact, that the

Leonidas perhaps sent the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*lakedaimo/nioi</foreign>
away, and only retained his own bodyguard,
together, of course, with the
Boiotian contingent, and possibly others
(Lokrians?). The heroism of the king's
decision is not cheapened if we suppose
it dictated not by mere blind loyalty to
the real or supposed maxims of Spartan
warfare, but by a well-considered plan
of action, designed to save the situation,
or at least to save as many fighting men
for Greece as possible. That the king
and the Spartans were bound to stay to
the last is obvious: their retreat must
have meant a panic flight for most of
the others.</p></div>

This appears to be a brief and
lucid explanation of the verses which
follow: rarely did Delphi put the future
alternatives so clearly before the consultants.
In this case both the verses
and the gloss appear to be <foreign rend="ital">ex eventu.</foreign>
They serve a double purpose: (1) Delphi
finds in this story a part of its apology,
or rehabilitation; (2) Sparta finds a
consolation, a justification for the
apparent failure at Thermopylai. The
story is intrinsically improbable, and
its historical eredibility is further
damaged by the preservation of a variant
in <bibl n="Diod. 11.4">Diodoros 11. 4</bibl>, which, however, only
puts the ‘devotio’ of Leonidas and his
men in its proper perspective, if any
such oracle had really been obtained by
Sparta before the war. There Leonidas
leaves Sparta, with full knowledge and
deliberate intention of incurring his
fate, in order to compass the prediction,
the Ephors being fully cognizant of his
purpose. The earlier and more tentative
form of the legend in Hdt. appears as
an alternative to the historical traditions,
which represent the defence of Thermopylai
as a serious undertaking, intended
and expected to succeed. Hdt.
has combined, or at least ‘contaminated,’
the two traditions, the fact and
the fable; but has preserved, or obtained,
neither in its full form. More might
surely have been ascertained of the true
story of Thermopylai-Artemision in his
day than he has either consciously or
implieitly presented: by a sort of
<pb n="326"/>

accepting the fact, shows a
curious wisdom in saying: “The
Thespians were perhaps excited <gap/> by
the hope of becoming <gap/> the head of the
Boeotian confederacy.” What &lt;*&gt; the 700,
from little Thespiai, who remained to
die? If so, they were nicely fooled!
But if 700 men of Thespiai remained
with Leonidas, and died side by side
with the 300 Spartans, history and
poetry ever since have failed in their
duty to these heroes of the city of Eros.
However deeply Hdt. has drunk, directly
and indirectly, of Spartan sources, however
partial the legend of Thermopylai
to the gallant leader and his guard, these
Thespians could not be such mere ghosts
and supers on the stage of Thermopylai
had their action and their fate been such
as Hdt. here records in a parenthesis.
The reconstructed story of Thermopylai
must take account of this consideration:
cp. Appendix V. § 5. Diodoros gives no
Thespians in the army-list (<bibl n="Diod. 11.4.7">11. 4. 7</bibl>),
but afterwards mentions that Leonidas
retained the Thespians with him, an act
which only raises his total force to 500
(<bibl n="Diod. 11.9.2">11. 9. 2</bibl>).</p></div>

Leake in one place seems to contravert
the truth of this statement (<title>N.G.</title> ii. 54).
Rawlinson (<foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>) replies that if the
descent by <title>Ai Janni</title> (a monastery) be
taken as the track of Hydarnes instead
of the more circuitous one preferred by
Leake, Hdt.'s statement is correct. But
Leake himself (<foreign rend="ital">ej op.</foreign> p. 39) recognizes
that ‘the summit’ was nearer to the east
end of the ridge than to the Asopian
plain, whence (according to him) Hydarnes
had begun his march; so that
Hdt.'s assertion is true, whatever the
precise route followed from the summit
(of the pass) to Alpenoi. Dr. Grundy's
map unfortunately does not display
the path ‘Anopaia’; his report, too,
leaves some doubt as to the relative
distances from the Asopos to the summit,
and from the summit to Thermopylai,
<title>G.P.W.</title> p. 302f. The whole distance,
which Leake (<foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> 54) estimated at not
less than 12 miles, Grundy puts at not
much less than 17. The matter is a
small one, and not a point on which
anything important here turns. The
actual time occupied by Hydarnes in
descending from the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)krwth/rion</foreign> in c. 217
—which it had taken them all night to
reach—to his arrival at the Middle Gate
in c. 225 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> would not be more than
5 or 6 hours. But it is not to be

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ eu)ru/teron tou= au)xe/nos</lem></app>. The
phrase is obscure. <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)xh/n</foreign> suggests rather
a convexity than a concavity, rather a
hill than a hollow, rather an isthmus
than a tunnel; cp. 1. 72 (neck of Anatolia),
6. 37 (of Thrakian Chersonese).
But Hdt. also uses the word in applica<pb n="330"/>
tion to waterways, 4. 85, 118 (Bosporos),
4. 89 (Istros). So here the neck might
stand (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) for the pass as a whole, connecting
the head and body of Hellas.
But in this case Hdt. would be (erroneously)
representing the Hellenes as
advancing beyond the West Gate. Or
again (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the term might be applied to a
section of the pass, to wit, ‘the Middle
Gate’ itself, at which the Greeks were
posted, and which they were defending.
What then was the ‘neck’ of the Middle
Gate? (i.) If the Gate is correctly conceived
as a col, the road rising here up
over a projecting spur of the mountain
(Kallidromos), it would not be by nature
the narrowest, or even a very narrow
section of the pass, hence, indeed, the
wall built across it (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ e)/ruma tou= tei/xeos</lem></app>,
cp. c. 176). But this ‘spur,’ or the
‘saddle’ itself, might perhaps be called
a ‘neck’; or again (ii.) the road here, as
connecting the two semicircular theatres,
behind and before ‘the Middle Gate,’
might perhaps be so designated. In
either case the Spartans are here to bc
thought advancing down the slope in
front of the Phokian wall. But more
probably (iii.) ‘the Middle Gate’ may be
held to include a narrow stretch of roadway
below the hill, and between Kallidromos
and the sea, which, as Dr. Grundy
has fairly shown (<title>G.P.W.</title> p. 286), connected
in ancient times the hill, on which
he places the Phokian wall, with the
more open ground in the neigh bourhood
of the hot springs. If so, that passage
to the west, below the hill, might be
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)xh/n</foreign>, the hill itself being presumably
the head. (Dr. Grundy himself uses
the term ‘neck’ of the ridge connecting
the mound of the Middle Gate with the
mouutain side, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 288 <foreign rend="ital">bis,</foreign> p. 289
<foreign rend="ital">bis,</foreign> and also carries the ancient road
over this very ‘neck.’) If the <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)xh/n</foreign> is
this stretch of straight road below the
mound or col, and flanked on the south
by Kallidromos, on the north by the sea,
then the Lakedaimonians must be conceived
as advancing not merely beyond
the wall and down the hill, but through
this ‘neck’ into the more open theatre
about the hot springs (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ eu)ru/teron</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/cw
tw=n steinw=n</foreign>). But in this case <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ eu)ru/teron</foreign>

that the sentence <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/pipton <gap/> a)pollume)nou</foreign>

the land-forces of Xerxes. Taking 300
as a poetic license for 30, or ‘myriads’

Plutarch's arguments are not
all equally convincing, but those which
arise from the admissions of Hdt. and
the nature of the case are sufficiently
strong, apart from the conflict of evidence
as to matters of fact. They may be
enumerated briefly: (i.) Leonidas would
not have kept with him men suspected
of medism or treachery at the supreme
hour; (ii.) he would have given them
‘as hostages’ to the departing Greeks;
(iii.) he could not, with 300 men,
have detained them, 400 strong, against
their will; (iv.) their detention would
have been inconsistent with his object,
as reported by Hdt. (c. 220), to secure
the glory for the Spartans alone; (v.)
the battle-field was no place for such an
appeal as that made by the Thebans
(weak!); (vi.) the Thebans would not
have asked support from the Thessalians.
with whom they were at enmity, had
just been at war (a question of evidence!
the ‘silence’ of Hdt. does not disprove
Plutarch's statement); (vii.) the <foreign rend="ital">stigmata</foreign>
would have been an honour to the
Thebans: the bodies of Leontiades and of
Leonidas were alike despitefully used by
Xerxes; (viii.) as a matter of fact, Leontiades
was not the commander of the
Thebans on this occasion. See below.</p>

Plutarch says that Hdt. was the first
historian to record the branding of the

of necessity extend to the whole
anecdote, the whole chapter. Even if
the source of the scandal against the
The bans is an Athenian or atticizing
(e.g. Plataian) one, there was plenty of
bad blood all along, and there were even
special occasions, during the <title>Pentekontaeteris,</title>
to account for the story of the
Theban conduct at Thermopylai, without
supposing that the whole story dates
after the surprise of Plataiai in 431 B.C.
by Eurymachos, son of Leontiades.
Plutarch indeed (<foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) asserts that the
commander of the Thebans at Thermopylai
was not Leontiades at all, but
Anaxandros; and as he quotes the
authority of Aristophanes (of Boiotia)
and Nikandros of Kolophon for the fact,
it cannot be easily discredited; but the
insertions in Hdt. might easily extend
to the name of Leontiades in this
chapter, and in c. 205 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> It is
more certain that Eurymachos, son of
Leontiades, commanded the Thebans at
Plataiai in 431 B.C. (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.2.3">Thucyd. 2. 2. 3</bibl>),

The figure 8000 is obviously a round
number. It represents here the total
sum of adult citizens for 480 B.C. It
may represent Hdt.'s estimate for his
own time; cp. 5. 97. It accords with
the army-list for Plataiai, to whieh
Sparta furnishes 5000 citizen-soldiers
(cp. 9. 10, 28) on the assumption that
the levy <foreign xml:lang="greek">pandhmi/</foreign> is to be reckoned at
two-thirds (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.10.2">Thuc. 2. 10. 2</bibl>); that figure
thereimplies a total of 7500-8000 citizens.</p>
<p>Beloch, <title>Bevolkerung</title> 131 ff., has challenged
this figure, and rejected the belief
in a material reduction of the total
number of Spartan citizens during the
fifth and fourth centuries. He takes
2500-3000 as a constant maximum for the
Spartiate militia; he thinks the 5000
Spartans at Plataiai include 2500 Perioikoi;
he regards all higher estimates as
exaggerations; the supposed diminution
in the number of citizens he explains as
itself an exaggerated inference from the
growth of the class of Spartan ‘inferiors’
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pomei/ones</foreign>) by transfers from the class of
‘Peers’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/moioi</foreign>). Thus, to take an extreme
case, he sees the ‘Peers’ in the
700 Spartans of Plutarch, <title>Agis</title> 5, although
Plutarch adds <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ tou/twn i)/sws e(kato\n
h)=san oi( gh=n kekthme/noi kai\ klh=ron</foreign>. Could
a Spartiate be a ‘Peer’ without possessing
a <foreign xml:lang="greek">klh=ros</foreign>?</p>
<p>Beloch's analysis of the data for the
Peloponnesian war and the subsequent
periods is illuminative; but his reduction
of the Spartan totals to 3000 or less, and
his denials of any serious reduction in
the number during the fifth and fourth
centuries, are not convincing. The only
express text which supports his contention
is Isokrates, <title>Panath.</title> 286 (§ 255),
where the rhetor reduces the original
militia of Sparta to 2000 men, for rhetorical
purposes: the passage, however,
implies a larger figure for the writer's
own day.</p>
<p>The following considerations are adverse
to Beloch's theory:—</p>
<p>(i.) The strong tradition of higher
figures, in Herodotus, Aristotle, Plutarch.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) Would Hdt. have assigned 8000
citizen soldiers to Sparta, if such a total
was from three to four times too large?
The Spartans may have been as discreet
in warfare as the Japanese, but the Greek
world could hardly have blundered so
grossly as to acquiesce in a trebled estimate.
Nor is Demaratos dramatically
‘pulling the king's leg’ on this occasion
to make sport for Hdt.'s audience: the
<pb n="345"/>
Plataian army-list would refute that
suggestion.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Aristotle, <title>Pol</title> 2. 9. 16=1270 A, records
a tradition that the Spaitans had
once numbered 10,000. The figure is
obviously conventional, but it is not
irrational, and it stands quite out of
relation to 2000-3000.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Plutarch's 9000 (<title>Lyk.</title> 8) no doubt
represents a theory in the days of Agis
IV. (cp. Grote, ii. 314), but a theory
may be good or bad. As the number of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">klh=roi</foreign> in a Lykourgean land-assignation
the figure is no doubt unhistoric; as a
regulative maximum for Sparta's citizens
it may deserve more respect. Beloch
admits that Agis and Kleomenes III.
raised the number of citizens to 4500,
some 1500 above his own normal maximum
for the fifth and fourth centuries.
Sparta never had so many citizens as in
the decadence!</p>
<p>(ii.) The position achieved by Sparta
in Lakonia, in Peloponnese, in Hellas,
coupled with her political constitution
which restricted the franchise to the
Spartiatai, would be inexplicable on the
supposition that the privileged few
numbered only some 3000 men.</p>
<p>(iii.) The evidence for a great and
growing reduction in the numbers of
Spartan citizens cannot be explained as
merely the reflexion of the relative and
changing numbers of ‘Peers’ and ‘Inferiors,’
both alike accounted Spartan
citizens. Moreover, the losses experienced
in the fifth and fourth centuries
(notably by the earthquake and Helot
rising in 464 B.C., and by the emancipation
of Messenia in 370 B.C.) go far to
explain a reduction in the actual numbers
of Spartiates, to say nothing of natural
decline in a close aristocracy, never reinforced
or recruited <foreign rend="ital">ab extra.</foreign></p>
<p>It is unnecessary here to discuss the
cognate question concerning the whole
census for Lakonia, the figures for which
must in large part be inferred from the
total for the citizen body: enough if
reason has been shown for a pause and
further retractation of the whole evidences
available, before discarding the
Herodotean figures for the Herodotean
period. Aristotle's verdict that the
land could have supported 1500 cavalry
and 30,000 hoplites (<title>Pol.</title> 2. 9. 16=
1270 A) should be carefully considered.</p></div>

of Lakedaimon, contemporary with

(about contemporary, that might be,
with Solon and other sages), who gives
some advice to the Athenian, which is
not taken. In 6.65 there is a Chilon
son of Demarmenos, whose daughter,
Perkalos, is wife to Demaratos. The
contemporary of Solon cannot be the
father-in-law of Demaratos; perhaps the
two Chilons were grandfather and grandson;
but which was the sage? Probably
the elder.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)/fh</lem></app>. The observation of Chilon
obviously means that Kythera, from the
opportunity it offered to an enemy (especially
a maritime power) as a base of
operations against Lakonia, was more of
a curse than a blessing to ‘mesogaian’
Sparta. Was this strategic observation
as old as the days of Solon, or as young
as the Archidamian war, and moreover
the eighth year thereof (424 B.C.)?
Stein, without venturing to date the
composition of this passage as late as
424, argues that the comparison of this
place with Thucydides, 4. 52 ff., appears
to prove that the notion of occupying
Kythera had been cuirent since the
beginning of the war (431 B.C.), i.e. he
appears to think that this passage was
written after the outbreak of the Archidamian
war in the light of an idea first
started in or about 431 B.C. But <bibl n="Paus. 1.27.5">Pausan.
1. 27. 5</bibl> preserves a completely acceptable
record of the occupation of Kythera by
Tolmides, on his great <title>Periplous,</title> which
is also recorded, without much detail, by
<bibl n="Thuc. 1.108.5">Thuc. 1. 108. 5</bibl>, though he mentions the
burning of Gytheion. The date of that
exploit is 456-455; cp. Busolt, <title>Gr. Gesch.</title>
iii. 1. 325 f. This earlier date for the
inception of the idea suits far better any
rational view of the composition of Hdt.'s
history, and especially of the provenience
of his sources, as here the Demaratossource,
than Stein's indication. But is
the perception of the strategic aspects of
Kythera only as old as Tolmides and
the exploit of the <title>Pentekontaëteris</title>? It
figures here, in the first instance, as a
virtual criticism on a profound error or
shortcoming in the Persian plan of campaign:
it is repeated substantially in
Bk. 9. 9 as the sagacious criticism, not
of Chilon the Spartiate but of Chileos the
Tegeate! and referred not to the Persian
fleet in 480 B.C. but to the Athenian
fleet in 479 B.C. There was one man at
least at that time who will have understood
perfectly the best use of a fleet
against the Peloponnesos, to wit, Themistokles;
and the veiled critique in 9. 9,
as here, might safely be carried back to
the great Athenian. That reference
would at least safeguard this passage as
part of Hdt.'s original concept and draft
of his work (cp. Introduction, § 9); but
is it even necessary to stop there? The
use of such islands generally, and of
Kythera in particular, was probably
understood in the Peloponnesos; and
ages before the Persian war (cp. 5. 125)
Kythera itself had been a bone of contention
(cp. 1. 82). It is dramatically
appropriate for Demaratos to point out
the obvious advantages of Kythera to
Xerxes, but we may be astonished at his
moderation in fathering the mot upon
even the elder Chilon; it might go back
to the days of the Phoenicians, or even
of Minos (to whom might be ascribed
the introduction of the Aphrodite cult:
is not the Snake-goddess of Knossos (cp.

allies constantly striving to push

kept Lakedaimonians within the Isthmos.
They could not help Kroisos or Ionia

conquered and incorporated in the Persian
empire (as Makedon and Thrace

surely it was Achaimenes. These repeated

is to stultify Achaimenes. But the
remarks in themselves are so painfully
true, the formula below (c. 237 <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ti

intention can hardly have been to stultify
Achaimenes. It is perhaps out of the
abundance of his own heart, and the
bitterness of his own experience, that
Hdt. here speaks in the person of
Achaimenes. Strange, that with this
clear perception of the viciousness of
envy as practised on earth, he should
have thought it pious and ethical when
transferred to heaven, and made a law
of the divine nature! Cp. c. 10 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>;
Introduction, § 11.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">nenauhgh/kasi tetrako/siai</lem></app>. Achaimenes
remembers the loss of 400 ships,

estimate’; but he has forgotten, or
ignores, the loss of 200, recorded in 8.
13, though it has taken place at least
forty-eight hours before the time of this
conversation, and he equally ignores the
losses in the three days' naval engagements
(8. 11, 12, 14 ff.), which have
preceded this conversation, on Hdt.'s
own showing. Either the conversation
is quite imaginary, or it is misdated.
It is certainly in part imaginary, and it
is probably, as presented, a fiction; but
the fundamental principle laid down by
Achaimenes, that the fleet and the land
forces must advance <foreign rend="ital">pari passu,</foreign> may be
rightly associated with his name, and
certainly represents the Persian plan of
campaign as pursued and maintained
from Doriskos to Salamis. The Greeks
in the suite of Xerxes, and especially
the European Greeks, and of them
perhaps Demaratos, may have criticized
this plan adversely, especially after the
relative success of the Greek fleet at
Artemision; and may have suggested
raiding the Peloponnesos. Perhaps this
advice was given rather at Phaleron
than in Trachis; cp. 8. 67 ff.</p></div>

are a long way from the Peloponnesos;
they have just annihilated Leonidas and

be regarded as a device to break up the
Greek fleet; for that purpose a <foreign rend="ital">mise en

These words are an absurdity placed here
immediately after the fall of Thermopylai,
i.e. immediately after the three days
fighting off Artemision. They are dated
either too late, or more probably too
soon, and would be more appropriate on
the eve of the battle of Salamis as an
argument against breaking up the fleet
at Phaleron. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)rxh/n</lem></app>, ‘originally, in the

<div type="commline" n="15">

as conducted on the boards of the
comic opera. It amounts to this: there
are three points of which a good general
takes no account: first, the enemy's line
of defence; secondly, the enemy's course
of action; thirdly, the enemy's forces
and resources. One has known wars
conducted, alas! at least in their earlier
stages, apparently upon this fashion; but
no military authority, except the
Achaimenes of Hdt., has ever laid it
down as a deliberate maxim. It might
then be suspected that Hdt. is dramatically
conveying a criticism on the Persian
plan of campaign; but if so, it is a
grossly unfair one, and indeed refutes
itself—for has not Achaimenes just
protested against reducing the number

This inspection of the dead comes in here
curiously in view of 8. 24, in connexion
with which this passage must be read.
The original draft of Hdt.'s work would
seem not to have contained the (Athenian)
story of the fighting off Artemision at
all, or not at all in the form in which
we now read it. The previous conversation
with Demaratos and Achaimenes
completely ignores it. Apparently in
the original draft the Hellenes retired
from Artemision without, or almost
without, striking a blow (this was,
perhaps, as the Asianic Greeks liked to
tell the story); cp. Introduction, §§ 9, 10.</p></div>

<div type="chapter" n="239">
<p>The whole chapter is athetized
by Krueger on grounds which may be
classified as follows:—(i.) The anecdote
of Demaratos is here introduced as
though it were part of the main argument,
resumed after an episode, or
digression; whereas it is this anecdote
which is the digression. (ii.) The
formula for the digression, or rather the
return (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/neimi <gap/> e)ce/lipe</foreign>), is not Herodotean.
Hdt.'s formula is <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/neimi</foreign>, or
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pa/neimi e)pi\ to\n pro/teron lo/gon</foreign>, as c. 138
<foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> 1. 140. (iii.) This episode is
badly introduced here, and without
excuse in the context. If it had come
in anywhere, it should have been in
c. 220 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> (iv.) The asyndeton <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pu/qonto
*lakedaimo/nioi</foreign> is intolerable. (v.)
The argument is badly conducted: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>)
the description of the wonderful discovery
is postponed to a disquisition on the
motives of Demaratos; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the motive
is asserted to be ill-will, and then left
an open question. (vi.) The language
of the passage is not Greek, and not
Herodotean, but late: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ce/lipe</foreign>,
‘broke off,’ ceased, was interrupted, is
bad (but cp. <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>); (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ e)s *delfou/s</foreign>
for <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ e)n *delfoi=s e)s *delfou/s</foreign> will not do;
(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">tro/pw| qwmasi/w|</foreign> is not a genuine
Greek expression; (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">summa/xetai</foreign> should
be <foreign xml:lang="greek">summaxe/ei</foreign> (cp. 1. 98); (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> for
what follows, instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/de</foreign>; (<foreign rend="ital">f</foreign>)
these are late or rare words—<foreign xml:lang="greek">delti/on,
e)kkna/ein</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/pac l.</foreign>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">e&lt;*&gt;pith/kein, o/dofu/lac</foreign>.
Van Herwerden regards Krueger's argu<pb n="353"/>
ments as good, and brackets the whole
chapter. Stein obelizes only the first
sentence, which is genuine, if the rest of
the chapter is genuine. Krueger's arguments
are not all sound, nor all equally
unsound. (ii.) The formula does not
mean, ‘I resume my story, the thread
of my story, where it was interrupted,’
or ‘broke off’; it means, ‘I will here
return to a place in the story, where on
the former occasion (in the former draft)
I was guilty of an omission’ (or, where
the former narrative made an omission).
Thus (i.) the anecdote is not ieally
introduced here as a resumption of the
main thread, or current, of the story,
but as a <foreign rend="ital">casus omissus,</foreign> as an appendix
and supplement. That being so, the
formula could not be identical with that
for resuming the interrupted current of
the main narrative, and the very variation
of the formula is itself significant.
The appendix has not, indeed, much
justification in the context, but it has
some. (iii.) Stein, who accepts all the
chapter except the first (and indispensable)
sentence or <foreign rend="ital">junctura</foreign> as genuine,
points out that the preceding passage
has contained a striking evidence of the
loyalty of Demaratos to Xerxes and the
Persian cause. The forger (it must be
admitted), equally with the author, might
see to that. (iv.) The <title>Asyndeton</title> is no
more intolerable here than in the preceding
chapter (Stein's acceptance of all
but the first sentence verily makes the
<title>Asyndeton</title> intolerable). (v.) Badly conducted
arguments are not really unHerodotean;
there are heaps of them in
the genuine work. (vi.) The arguments
from language are overdone: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)klei/pein</foreign> is
a word used by Hdt. in a variety of
senses; in 4. 33 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)klipei=n *)/andron</foreign> is to
‘skip’ Andros; c. 83 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> contains a
very strange use of the word; <cit><bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 513">Aischyl.
<title>Pers.</title> 513</bibl> <quote xml:lang="greek">polla\ d' e)klei/pw le/gwn</quote></cit>, ‘I
omit a great deal in my report.’ (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) a
textual emendation would set right.
(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Is it <foreign xml:lang="greek">tro/pos</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">qwma/sios</foreign>, or the combination
of the two, which is barbarous?
The expression certainly is not happy,
or even true; but why not Greek? (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">summa/xesqai</foreign> is used by Xenophon, Plato,
etc., but not apparently earlier. (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> seems paralleled in c. 152 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tau=ta le/getai w(s ktl.</foreign> The <title>Testimonia</title>
for this chapter do not prove its
authenticity, but they date the text
a long way back, and the anecdote
still further. Thus Pollux cites ‘Herodotos’
for words found only in this
passage, and so carries it far beyond any
extant MS., and perhaps to the Aichetype:
<title>Onomast.</title> 4. 18 <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(hro/dotos me\n
le/gei delti/on di/ptuxon</foreign>: 10. 58 <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(hro/dotos
me\n ga\r khro\n ei)/rhken</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">th=? pinaki/di e)no/nta</foreign>).
Again, Aeneas Tacticus (<foreign rend="ital">circa</foreign> 350 B.C.)
has the anecdote without names, places,
or date: <title>Poliork.</title> 31. 14 <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/dh de/ tis e/n
de/ltou cu/lw| gra/yas khro\n e)pe/thce</foreign> [v.l.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pe/qhke] kai\ a)/lla ei)s to\n khro\n e)ne/grayen,
ei\=ta o)/te h)=lqe par' o(\n e)/dei, e)kknh/sas to\n
khro\n kai\ a)nagnou\s o(motro/pws a)ntepe/steilen</foreign>.
This text is apparently genuine,
and possibly based upon the passage here
in question; at least Valckenaer was
hardly right in thinking Polyainos 2. 20
derived from Aeneas as alternative to
Hdt., for the anecdote is there told
without the use of a single notable word
from this chapter (except the proper
names): <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dhma/ratos, e)piste/llwn *spartia/tais
peri\ th=s *ce/rcou stratei/as, e)s ptu/xa
a)kh/rwton th\n e)pistolh\n gra/yas e)pekh/rwsen,
i(/na w(s a)/grafos dia\ tw=n fula/kwn
komisqh=|</foreign>. If it is too much to say that
Polyainos here owes nothing to Hdt.,
yet Trogus Pompeius had told the
anecdote in an alternative version, in
which the ‘sister of Leonidas’ figures
unnamed, a ‘slave’ is introduced as
messenger, and the action of Demaratos is
ascribed to patriotism. Either Trogus,
i.e. his source, is contradicting Hdt., or
an interpolator of Hdt. is contradicting
the <foreign rend="ital">amicitior patriae post fugam, quam
regi post beneficia</foreign> of the rival source (cp.
Justin 2. 10. 12-17). The existence,
perhaps pre-existence, of the variant is
adverse to the authenticity of the text.
In fine, there are four principal counts
against the passage.</p>
<div type="commline" n="1">
<p>The linguistic or styhstic pecnliarities
in the chapter throw doubt on its
Herodotean authorship. The late words
are most suspicious; the accumulation
of an omalies betrays a forger.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="2">
<p>The extremely unfavourable impression
of Demaratos conveyed by this
chapter conflicts with all the other
passages in which he figures in the
work of Hdt. (but cp. 6. 61).</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="3">
<p>This chapter supplies the name of
the wife of Leonidas. It appears, in
fact, as a combination of c. 205 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>
with 5. 48.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="4">
<p>The existence of the discrepant
version (Trogus), and what may be called
<pb n="354"/>
the ‘tentative’ version (Aeneas), suggests
that this anecdote is a gradual and
relatively late fabrication, and cannot
be traced back to the sole authority of
Hdt. in this passage, which might have
commanded more general assent from
the first.</p>
<p>But if the student of Hdt. should still
prefer <foreign rend="ital">errare cum Steinio</foreign> (quem ne hic
quidem nisi summa cum laude nomino&lt;*&gt;)
he must see, with Stein, in this chapter
evidence of at least one retractation of the
work by its author. Stein regards this
passage, though “irreproachable in contents
and language” (<foreign rend="ital">nach Inhalt und
Sprache unverdachtig</foreign>), as a later addition
from the author's hand—with the exception
of the first sentence, which he
regards as a spurious and therefore still
later addition. Here then is a recognition,
<foreign rend="ital">quantum valeat,</foreign> of the three drafts!

the army-list given above 7. 202. The

not (with Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi>) to a lacuna (<title>Ausfall

insertions, in the text by author and by

original continuity. The abruptness
has been at once emphasized and obliterated
by the division into books, made (by
some anonymous Alexandrian), naturally
enough, just at this point. The result
has been still further to divorce the
synchronous and inter-related operations
on land and sea, the stories of Thermopylai

Hdt., on which point see further, Introduction,

Blakesley argues that the verb implies

‘Kleruchs’ (5. 77, 6. 100)? or natives of

acutely remarks that 4000 men represent
just the complement for 20 triremes;
and it is possible that there is a relation
between the 20 here and the 4000 there
(<foreign rend="ital">ll.c.</foreign>). But if so, the 4000 is probably
an inference from the 20, and this passage
is the older of the two (whether Hdt.
himself or his authorities made the
combination and drew the inference).
This observation further strengthens the
suspicion with which the figure 4000 is
to be viewed (cp. my note to 5. 77),
seeing that here the crews of these
triremes may well have been natives of
Chalkis and the Athenian Kleruchs
serving merely, or mamly, as <foreign rend="ital">epibatai</foreign>

Perioikoi; and perhaps there were few,

Epibatai and officers. The Lakedaimonian
contingent looks miserably small
for the hegemonic power; but the service
at Thermopylai is concomitant. Even
at Salamis the Lakedaimonians muster

doubtful sense, this whole sentence is
naturally suspect. The verb <foreign xml:lang="greek">parei/xonto</foreign>,
too, is unfortunate, repeated, as it is,
just below. Yet the <foreign xml:lang="greek">moi</foreign> makes for
authenticity, and there is a sufficient
reason for the introduction of the

to justify the <foreign rend="ital">order</foreign> in which the
ethnic names have been given, as corresponding
to the relative strength of the
respective contingents. A. G. Laird in
<title>Class. Rev.</title> xviii. 1904, 97 ff. suggests,
on the analogy of an Ionic inscription
<foreign rend="ital">circa</foreign> 400 B.C., that Hdt. might have
intended <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/rhtai</foreign> ( = <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)re/atai</foreign>) as a plural;
a <foreign rend="ital">corruptela</foreign> might seem the simpler
alternative. The difficulty in the
sentence appears to arise less from the
use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s</foreign> to signify the order of the
list than from the presence of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/</foreign>
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign>). The sentence would certainly

The article, however, may be referred

The aorist (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/fasan</foreign>) may here have
temporally the force of a pluperfect, and

It may have been of long standing,
though of little importance, before the
Persian war (cp. 3. 39). Eurybiades
was not (perhaps) elected in view of the
Persian war, but in the ordinary course
of business; he is credited, by tradition,
with little aptitude for the post, and in
the two ensuing naval campaigns the
command is entrusted to men of royal
standing, Leotychidas, Pausanias.</p></div>

there is no ehange of subjeet, if the
subject of all the final verbs (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)=kon,
e)de/onto, die/decan, e)poieu=nto, a)pei/lonto</foreign>)
is ‘the Athenians,’ then the passage
contains a distinetly unfavourable judgement
upon the conduct of Athens, thereby
conflieting not merely with the general
Atticism of Hdt., but with the immediate
context, wherein their patriotism, their
pan-Hellenism, has been commended.
‘The Athenians, however, made these
coneessions only so long as they were
badly in need of them (the allies? or
the Lakedaimonians? in preference the
latter); for as soon as they had repulsed
the Persian, and were carrying the war
into the enemy's country, they deprived
the Lakedaimonians of the lead on pretext
of the violence of Pausanias.’ But
there is something to be said for a change
of subject. The repulse of the Persian,
and the war in Ionia or Thrace, were not
simply the doing of the Athemans:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">w)sa/menoi, e)poieu=nto, a)pei/lonto</foreign> should
hardly be referred exclusively to the
Athenians, but rather to ‘the allies,’
or ‘the Hellenes’, in which ease <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)tw=n</foreign>
will refer to ‘the Athenians,’ and the
meaning will be: ‘the Athenians gave
way and yielded, until such time as they
(the allies, the Greeks) had sore need
of them (or possibly ‘petitioned them’),
as they showed: for the Greeks, after
repulsing the Persian, etc.’ The words
<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s die/decan</foreign> are in any case against the
alternative rendering of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)de/onto</foreign>, for it
would be intolerably harsh' to take ‘the
Greeks’ as the subject of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)de/onto</foreign> and
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)poieu=nto</foreign>, but resume ‘the Athenians’
as the subject of the intercalary <foreign xml:lang="greek">die/decan</foreign>.
If, however, the subject of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)de/onto</foreign> is
<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( su/mmaxoi</foreign>, there is some confusion of
thought in the passage, as the allies,
or Hellenes, who deprived the Lakedaimonians
of the naval hegemony at
Byzantion in 477 B.C., were quite different
persons and states from the allies who
refused naval hegemony to the Athenians
in 481 B.C. The story of the transfer
is told, from an Attic point of view,

<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( strateuo/menoi e)p' *)artemi/sion</foreign> of c. 2,
or again <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( e)s to\n nautiko\n strato\n

<foreign xml:lang="greek">stratei/a</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/picis e)p' *)artemi/sion</foreign>, are
successive epochs in the operations of
the fleet, the last of which is here more
precisely defined by the sight of the
enemy's fleet already in position at
Aphetai, albeit whether the occupation
of Artemision by the Greeks here involved
precedes or succeeds the occupation
of Aphetai by the Persians is not
quite clearly indicated in this context.
A problem at once arises as to the relation
of this narrative to the narrative
in Bk. 7. There the occupation, or first
oecupation, of Artemision by the Greeks
precedes by some time the appearance
of the Persian ships at Aphetai (ep. 7.
177, 183, 195). The Greek fleet, in fact,
apparently occupies Artemision before
the Persian fleet has quitted Therme,
and actually retrcats from Artemision to
Chalkis upon news of the Persian advance
signalled from Skiathos (7. 183). But
the three days' storm detains the Persian
fleet <foreign rend="ital">en voyage,</foreign> and not until the fourth
and last day of the storm (7. 191), that
is, the fifth day after leaving Therme,
at earliest, could the Persian fleet have
steered into Aphetai (7. 193). The
Greeks have already resumed their station
at Artemision on the third (or fourth)
day of the storm (7. 192), and consequently
it is the Persians on their way
to Aphetai who lose fifteen ships to the
Greeks already stationed, for the second
time, at Artemision (7. 194). To harmonize
this passage with that it must
be inferred that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/picis e)p' *)artemi/sion</foreign>
here in question is the second occupation
of Artemision by the Greek fleet which
in Bk. 7 precedes, not merely the arrival
of the Persian ships at Aphetai, but
apparently even their departure from
the Magnesian strand. This harmony,
indeed, Hdt. himself has apparently
attempted. Stein finds a proof of this
in the otherwise superflnous <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kai/</lem></app> in this
passage: a still clearer proof lies in the
sentence <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pei\ au)toi=si para\ do/can ktl.</lem></app>,
which clearly resumes the statement in
7. 192, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)lpi/santes o/li/gas tina/s sfi a/ntico/ous
e)/sesqai ne/as</foreign>. The attempt is clear;
not so the harmony itself. For (1) the
Greeks here on arriving at Artemision
(for the second time) apparently discover
the Persians before them at Aphetai;
(2) the Greeks at once project a second
retreat. But such a retreat at this point
is out of the question, as inconsistent
with the whole plan of defence for
Thermopylai-Artemision, and also inconsistent
with the brilliant success they
have just achieved (according to 7. 194)
in the capture of fifteen of the king's
vessels. The conclusions are forced upon
us that the two passages are in the main
from different sources (the one here probably
of European, the other, that in
Bk. 7, of Asianic origin), and that Hdt.
has been ill-advised in his attempt to
harmonize them, especially in his duplication
of the retirement, or supposed retirement,
of the Greek fleet from Artemision.
The doubling of his sources has also
apparently doubled the storms, and complicated
other episodes in the naval operations,
for the reduction of which to the
simpler issues see further, Appendix V.</p></div>

might explain the hostility of Athens
to the memory of Adeimantos, were it
not that the stories to the discredit of
Adeimantos are surely far older than
the exploits of Aristeas his son. The
account of the bribery of Adeimantos by
Themistokles at Artemision is, indeed,
not merely absurd in view of the strategic
necessities of the position, and obviously
‘pragmatic’—to the discredit of Themistokles
too; but it is flagrantly inconsistent
with the stories of the relations
between The mistokles and the Korinthian
admiral just before the battle of Salamis.
It is thus donbly significant that the
version of the story followed by Plutarch,
<title>Themist.</title> 7, omits Adeimantos altogether.
If there is any truth in the tradition of
the employment of money by Themistokles
to proeure a halt, to promote a
battle, the scene must be laid at Salamis,
not at Artemision, where the Peloponnesians
could no more have thought of
retreating than the Athenians themselves,
as long as Leonidas was holding Thermopylai.

of the Korinthian strategos are here

<p>The construction (and sense) of the

verb simply as = <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/dh</foreign>, but always as
reinforcing a temporal adverb, generally
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/teron</foreign>, and so in its normal (comparative)
force of ‘still’—the point of departure
being the latest date, and the
point of arrival not ‘already’ but ‘still’
and ‘still’ earlier. In c. 62 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k

the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti</foreign> may have its true (temporal)

separate, or connect, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti pro/teron</foreign>.
The very pecuhar ease in 9. 102 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti kai\

<foreign rend="ital">ad l. infra</foreign>). The <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> here therefore
remains a problem, most simply resolved
by understanding it as intensive ‘still
even’ (or ‘even still’) earlier, and
taking the phrase as quahfying <foreign xml:lang="greek">puqo/menoi</foreign>
(c. 69 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>, quoted above, favouring
this, as well as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/te de\ au)toi\

be taken with <foreign xml:lang="greek">nauloxe/ein</foreign>, then <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> is
disjunctive (‘still as before,’ referring

they might have some time to wait for
the signal that the circumnavigating
squadron had arrived (in the Euripos?
or where?). But where was such a
signal to come from? No part or point
of Euboia was as yet in Persian hands.
The signal was to be given from the
mainland — an unconscious indication
that the circumnavigating squadron was
directed rather against Thermopylai than
<pb n="368"/>
against Artemision. This conclusion
supports the theory that 200 ships were
detached from the Persian fleet off the
Magnesian coast—or earlier. The voyage
from Skiathos to the Euripos, round
Kaphereus and Geraistos, could not be
less than 200 (E.) miles; sailing night
and day, under favourable circumstanees,
the squadron could hardly arrive at
Chalkis, not to say at Thermopylai, in
less than thirty-six hours (cp. 4. 86, where
a ship is supposed to perform 1300 stades
in a <foreign xml:lang="greek">nuxqhmeron</foreign>; but we have here 200
ships to move together, and a difficult
channel to negotiate). It was, perhaps,
hoped that the flying squadron would

according to Hdt. Skyllias reported
to the Greek admirals (1) the
storm, its origin and effects; (2) the
despatch of the 200 ships round Enboia.
The Greeks knew all about the storm
already, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/nta ta\ geno/mena peri\ th\n
nauhgi/hn</foreign>, from their sconts, 7. 192, and
they had also, apparently before the
arrival of Skyllias, captured fifteen of

their prisoners, 7. 194 f. It is
possible (with Stein) to emphasize the
construction <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s ge/noito</lem></app> as referring not

seems to make the report on the storm
(off Pelion) the chief point of Skyllias's
communication; while, upon the face of
it, his report on the flying squadron was
newer and more startling and important
tidings for the Greeks. But what did
he report of the 200 ships? Simply
that they had been despatched? Or
that they too had been, must have been,
wrecked? (<foreign xml:lang="greek">w(s nenauhgh/kasi</foreign>).</p></div></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">oi( *(/ellhnes</lem></app>: sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( strathgoi\ tw=n

a squadron round Euboia the Greek
admirals held a council of war (<foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gon
sfi/si au)toi=si e)di/dosan</foreign>). So far the statement
may be historical; what follows is
<pb n="370"/>
inconsistent with itself, and unintelligible.
The Greeks debate various alternatives
(not stated); they decide upon one,
and that one an absurdity, a strategic
inconceivability; and they proceed to
act in defiance of their decision. For
obvious reasons the Greeks at Artemision
could not abandon that position, so long
as Thermopylai was held by Leonidas;
they cannot have determined at this
point to retreat. Nor was any such
move demanded by the Persian <foreign rend="ital">periplous</foreign>
of Euboia; a few ships would be sufficient
to hold the narrow channel at
Chalkis, and, if that were held, the fleet
at Artemision, the army at Thermopylai,
had little to fear from the <foreign rend="ital">periplous.</foreign>
But a real source of anxiety may have
lain in a doubt as to the true objective
of the Persian flying squadron. What
if the 200 vessels were making, not for
Chalkis, but for Oropos, for Phaleron,
for the Isthmos? The storm may have
reassured the Greeks, convinced that
a squadron on the high sea could not
weather it, even if Skyllias had reported
only the despatch of the Persian vessels.
The actual resolution taken by the
Greeks is to be inferred from their
action; they must have decided to remain,
and to attack the Persian fleet, or
perhaps the rear-guard thereof. Possibly
the account here of the fighting on the
‘first’ day, resulting in the capture of
thirty ships, is an unconscious doublet
of the account given in 7. 194 of the
capture of the fifteen ships, that being
from an Asianic, this from a European

this day witnesses (1) the arrival of the
Persian fleet at Aphetai, (2) the arrival
of Skyllias at Artemision, (3) the council
of war, (4) the first engagement at sea,
whether this be, or be not, identical
with (5) the capture of the fifteen ships
described in 7. 194; to these items
must apparently be added (6) the first
day's fighting at Thermopylai, and, as
Hdt. would have us believe, (7) the
despatch of the squadron to circumnavigate
Euboia. It is, however, possible
that these events are unduly accumulated.
The despatch of the squadron to circumnavigate
Euboia is, as above shown, to
be dated before the Persian fleet passed
Skiathos and the <foreign rend="ital">myrmex,</foreign> that is, before
the storm. The interval (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n de\ tou/tw| tw=|
xro/nw|</foreign> c. 8 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) between the despatch
of the squadron and the arrival of Skylhas
at Artemision may have comprised not
hours, but days; or again, his arrival
at Artemision may have anticipated the
Persian arrival at Aphetai by some days,
and not, as apparently implied by Hdt.
here, have succeeded it by some hours.
Again, the further chronological indication
just below (<foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ de\ tou=to</foreign>) is of little
or no value, the interval being entirely
vague. If Skyllias arrived in the Greek
camp before the storm, before the Persians
had passed Skiathos, in fact days before
the capture of the fifteen Persian vessels,
or the first engagements at Artemision
and Thermopylai, then, indeed, the
Greek admirals may have decided, on
the strength of his information, to detach
a portion of their own fleet (cp. c. 14
<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) to guard, or to reinforce the ships
guarding, the Euripos channel, while
themselves remaining on the spot (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">au)tou=</lem></app>),
as a matter of course, with the larger
part, to cover Thermopylai and the
northern channel (of Oreos) from the
advance of the Persian navy.</p></div>

It is, however, possible that these early

<pb n="371"/>
Aphetai, to say nothing of the subsequent
numbering, was not to be accomplished
in the twinkling of an eye; the only
synchronism to which we may cling
with desperate tenacity is the coincidence
of the three days' fightings at
Artemision and at Thermopylai, this
being grounded, though not absolutely,
in the strategic and tactical necessities of
the case. The use of <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">fula/cantes</lem></app> is made

<p>Blakesley suggests that the Greeks
timed their attack so as to have the sinking

further revision, for Aphetai is, if
anything, west of Artemision.</p></div>

cp. <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 395">Aischyl. <title>Pers.</title> 395</bibl>. The Greek
manœuvres are proceeding with the

ships are conglobated, and with their
sterns centred on one point (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s to\ me/son
ta\s pru/mnas sunh/gagon</foreign>): this position
is assumed at the first signal, for
previously they were rowing forward
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pane/pleon e)pi\ tou\s barba/rous</foreign> c. 9
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); at the second signal (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">deu/tera
de\ shmh/nantos</lem></app>) they shot forwards,
although by that time they were surrounded,
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri/ploos</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ku/klwsis</foreign> of
the enemy's more numerous fleet having
now developed itself: the Greek ships
charged the enemy bow to bow (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
sto/ma</foreign>). This account looks at first sight
plausible; reflexion shows it to be
deficient. Was the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ku/klwsis</foreign> indeed
complete? Was the Greek fleet completely
surrounded, and the individual
vessels radiating from a centre, like
spokes from a wheel, all round? Could
271 galleys really be arranged for practical
or tactical purposes on such a plan?
Or was the formation, perhaps, but in
a crescent or arc? And again, were the
Persian ships advancing <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ sto/ma</foreign>, or
<pb n="373"/>
were they rowing round and round the
Greeks in the attempt to compress them
into a small space? In the first of the two
engagements, afterwards so celebrated,
between Phormion and the Peloponnesians,
<foreign rend="ital">anno</foreign> 429 B.C., the Athenian
admiral, with but twenty ships, succeeded
in rowing all round a fleet of
47 sail, which the incompetent Knemos
had drawn up in a hollow circle, their
prows outwards, round their tenders and
convoys. If the Peloponnesian ships
on that occasion <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/rgou ei)/xonto e)n o)li/gw|
per a)polamfqe/ntes</foreign>, they might have
struck Phormion's ships, but not <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\
sto/ma</foreign>, bow to bow, but much more
advantageously, amidships or broadside.
As it was, the result of Phormion's
manœuvre was to compress the fleet of
Knemos into an ever-narrowing space,
and finally to throw it into complete
confusion (Thucyd. 2. 83 f.). But the
case here is different. A vastly superior
force is encircling an inferior number:
possibly in this case the ships advanced
<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ sto/ma</foreign>, prow to prow, albert ramming
on that system was not likely to result
in a Greek victory. Hence the suspicion
arises that there is something confused
and inaccurate in Hdt.'s description of
this engagement: the capture of the
thirty ships by the Greeks certainly
ensues with surprising rapidity. If
these thirty ships were cut off in some
way from the main fleet, the result would
be more intelligible. And again, if the
story (in 7. 194) of the capture of fifteen
ships, owing to a misunderstanding, be
the Asianic version of this first engagement,
we have to seek for a <foreign rend="ital">tertium quid,</foreign>
between that account, which reduces the
engagement to a mere contretemps, and
this account, which magnifies it into a
pitched battle and a glorious victory, as
the real event.</p></div>

remarkable that they settled this
‘Lemnian’ in Salamis rather than in
his native place. His exact status in
Lemnos, in Salamis, and in Athens, is
not quite clear. Was he an Athenian
citizen? Had he been so all along?
Had he been a citizen and forfeited his

when the ships are dashed ashore,
and cp. c. 7 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> As Rawlinson
remarks, it is not perfectly certain
what exact reach of Euboian coast is
denoted by ‘the Hollows.’ Strabo, 445,
makes it the tract between Geraistos
and the Euripos: <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s *eu)boi/as ta\ *koi=la
le/gousi ta\ metacu\ *au)li/dos kai\ tw=n peri\
*geraiston to/pwn: kolpou=tai gar h parali/a</foreign>.
The statement would have been more
convincing if the reason had not been
added, for the outer coast of Euboia,
tacing the high sea, is also hollowed
(in contrast, for example, with the
Magnesian coast), even if not sculptured
into such a remarkable series of
bays as the Paralia from Geraistos to
Chalkis. The Epitomator of Strabo
places the Hollows between Geraistos
and Kaphereus, a location preferred by
Leake (<title>Demi</title> 247); but the absence of
the requisite physical features to justify
such a nomenclature is fatal to this
identification. Not so the extension
of the term to the Paralia between
Kaphereus and the promontory Chersonnesos—a
coast the general trend of
which is more truly concave than the
line of coast west of Geraistos, which
is, in fact, a convex, broken by a series
of superficial recesses or cavities.
Possibly the term ‘Hollows’ was applied
to the whole of the southern scimitarshaped
section of Euboia, and so ships
wrecked on either side might be said
to have come to grief on or off the
Hollows. But if Strabo is right in restricting
the term as above explained,
and that not merely for his own day,
in that case Hdt. is almost certainly
wrong in making the Persian ships pass
Geraistos. They would hardly then
have been <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n pela/gei+</foreign>, and to wreck them
there we must conjure up an improbable
storm from the south or west in the
teeth of the Hellespontias and Boreas
which have been raging (at most a
day or two before) off Pelion. The
ships in Hdt. (<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign> Strabo) must have
been wrecked long before they rounded
Geraistos, or even Kaphereus, for they
are wrecked during the night following
the day upon which they have been
despatched. As above shown the
squadron of 200 sail, detached to circumnavigate
Euboia, was really detached
from the main fleet off the Magnesian
coast on the day or evening before
the great storm, and passing ‘outside
Skiathos’ rowed south a whole quiet
midsummer's mght (7. 188) before being
overtaken by the great storm. Hdt.
has apparently duplicated the storm,
the more easily as the stories there
and here are from different sources:
his chronology, as well as the causal
sequence, being dislocated thereby.</p></div>

the Greeks at Artemision were covering
Leonidas, and that Leonidas was making
it possible, yea, necessary, for the fleet
to remain at Artemision. On which of
the two correlated points the Greeks
desired the more stress to be laid is a
further question. less easy of solution;
perhaps they were not quite at one on
this matter. So much is clear, that a
really decisive victory off Artemision
might have saved Thermopylai and
Athens to boot. On the first two days,
according to their own account, the
Greek sea-dogs assumed the offensive

This phrase cannot mean that the Greeks

side of the king's fleet (<foreign xml:lang="greek">strato/s</foreign>). But
if the forces were still unequal, ‘they
came to be on an equality,’ because the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">me/gaqos</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign> turned rather
to the disadvantage of the barbarians,
as Hdt. explains. The obvious tendency
of the passage is apologetic, and
apologetic in the Greek interest, for in
view of their derring deeds of the two
previons days (and, it might be added,
in view of the sequel at Salamis), surely
a crowning victory was now to have
been expected. No such victory conld
be claimed for Artemision; but with
great subtilty the argument is converted
into an explanation of the failnre of the
larger and more numerous force to effect
the complete discomfiture of the smaller!

this passage the intention of an Asianic
source to explain the failure of the king's

Kleinias, son of Alkibiades, is, of
course, the father of that better known
Alkibiades, the pupil of Sokrates, and
the author of so much woe to Athens
from 421 B.C. onwards. The name
‘Alkibiades’ is probably rather a Spartan
than an Athenian favourite (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.6.3">Thuc.
8. 6. 3</bibl>), and the elder Alkibiades, a
member of the great clan of the
Eurysakidai (Petersen, <title>Hist. Gent. Att.</title>
1880, p. 126), or rather of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*eu)patri/dai</foreign>
(cp. Toepffer, <title>Attische Genealogie,</title> 1889,
pp. 175 ff.), had been at one time Spartan
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/cenos</foreign> in Athens, but had renounced
the office (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.43.2">Thuc. 5. 43. 2</bibl>), perhaps in
consequence of his relations with Kleisthenes
and the Alkmaionidai, a daughter
of which house, Deinarete by name, he
espoused, Alkibiades the younger, their
offspring, being thus related to Perikles
the son of Agariste (6. 131) on the
spindle side. The elder Alkibiades
had probably (with Aristeides, Xanthippos,
and others) opposed the naval
policy of Themistokles, and had suffered
ostracisin (see Appendix III. § 4), but,
if still alive, would have returned with
Aristeides (cp. c. 79 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>): that his
son Kleinias here defrays the expenses,
and more than all the expenses of a
<foreign xml:lang="greek">trihrarxi/a</foreign>, seems to show that the father
was no longer alive in 480 B.C. (or that
the son had an independent fortune?).
A further question arises whether the
said Kleinias was alive or dead when
this passage was written by Hdt. But
alas! this passage is consistent with
either alternative, and cannot be used
as conclusive of the date of composition.
Kleinias fell in the disastrous battle of
Koroneia in 447 B.C. (Plutarch, <title>Alkib.</title>
1), and the fact that his death is not
here mentioned might be taken to prove
that this passage was originally written
during his lifetime (cp. <foreign rend="ital">per contra</foreign> the
case of Sophanes 9. 75); but, on the
other hand, (i.) this record might well
have been taken from a sepulchral
monument; (ii.) the disaster at Koroneia
might better he passed over in silence;
(iii.) Hdt. might easily have inserted
a reference, had he wished to do so, in
the final revision of his work; (iv.) he

This fresh anecdote is less discreditable
but hardly more credible, at least in its
details and surroundings, than the other.
Themistokles here assumes an initiative
which belongs to Eurybiades (cp. c. 2
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). Moreover, he summons the
Strategoi to a council, when a council is
already sitting (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)bou/leuon</foreign> just above,
cp. c 21 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). Further, he treats the
question of retreat as settled, though
that is just the question at issue—or
rather, we may say, though Themistokles
eannot have dreamt of retreat, so long
as Leonidas held out; nor is it likely
that Eurybiades and the Peloponnesian
admirals committed themselves blindly
to Themistokles. In the speech put
into the Athenian's month two or three
different devices with different objects
are confusedly combined, and there is
a suggestion of deceit and unscrupulousness
imparted to the words and acts of
Themistokles, quite in the style of the
partisan legend. But that there is
something historical at the back of this
anecdote is likely enough. After retreat
became inevitable, Themistokles and the
Athenians perhaps volunteered, or were
detailed, to cover the retreat (cp. c.
21). All along Themistokles (and the
Athenians) will have been hoping and
planning to detach the Ionians from the
king's forces, perbaps to foment a new
Ioman ‘Revolt’; and Themistokles
may have made or left appeals, addressed
to the Ionians, behind him at Artemision
(cp. c. 22 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) The treatment of the
Euboians and their flocks requires no
justification; but the fires were not,
we may suppose, merely sacrificial or
<pb n="382"/>
culinary, but intended to deceive the
Persians into the belief that the Greeks
were still encamped at Artemision long
after they had cleared out: a common
stratagem (cp. Livy 22. 43. 6).</p></div>

navy-list in Bk. 7. 89 ff.; the IonioKarian
(+ Dorian) in the stricter sense
to exactly 200. Ariabignes was admiral
of this squadron, but whether the IonioKarian
division strictly corresponded to
its title may be questioned. In either
case the detachment of these contingents,
especially after the losses of the king's

The figures and the farce are alike incredible:
20,000 men cannot have fallen
at Thermopylai, still less could 19,000
have been so speedily interred; nor is
it by any means certain that the Persian
king would have caused them to be interred
at all—exposure being perhaps
the Persian custom; cp. 7. 117—though
doubtless he would have permitted the
various nations concerned each to follow
its own rite. Nor, had the king
attempted such a fraud, could he have
hoped to silence men's tongues, or befool
their eyes. It is likely enough that a
good many of the slain had been interred
before the visitors from the fleet made
their appearance at Thermopylai; for
the rest, the anecdote seems to be part
of the comic Nemesis which Greek
anecdote-mongers inflicted upon Xerxes

apparently means that the king had
caused all the Greek bodies to be collected
in one place. It is possible that something
of the kind had been done; in
any case the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xwri/on</foreign>, the spot where the
Greek dead would be thickest piled, was
no doubt the hill ou which the last
stand had been made; 7. 225 ff. Around
the hill might well be lying the corpses
of the king's men, where they had fought
and fallen. Stein thinks the object (of
the king—or the story-teller?) was to
make it appear that 4000 Greeks had
been slain by 1000 Persians, 4 Greeks
by each Persian (<foreign rend="ital">je vier von einem</foreign>); but,
really, neither Hdt., nor in the last resort
Xerxes, can well have expected any one
to believe that the 4000 dead Greeks had
been slain wholly and solely by the dead
Persians! The trick was devised, or
supposed to have been devised, to exhibit
the proportional losses on each
side. The figure 4000 for the Greek
dead comes no doubt from a misapplication
of the epigram in 7. 228, which
gives 4000 as the number of <title>Peloponnesians</title>
who <foreign rend="ital">fought,</foreign> not the number of
<title>Greeks</title> who <foreign rend="ital">fell,</foreign> at Thermopylai. Stein
here seems to overlook <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k *peloponna/sou</foreign>
there and makes the 4000 inelude
Thebans and Thespians. 3100 Peloponnesian
Hoplites are accounted for in
7. 202; but there were probably 1000
‘Lakedaimonians’ to boot, even not
including the Helots; or the 4000
might less probably be made up of 3100 +
900 Helots, 3 for each Spartiate. The

Thermopylai, first and last, far exceeded

that Carya had joined the Persians

the policy of the Peloponnesians during
the war; but does this anecdote go
beyond a mercenary adventure? Even
so, it is significant of the miserable lack

<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Xenoph. Platon. <foreign rend="ital">et al.</foreign> shows that

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)olu/mpia a)/gousi</lem></app>: the general
synchronism of the invasion with an
Olympiad is indubitable, and a cornerstone
for the chronology of the war;
but the exact comcidence of the festival,
or any of its five(?) days (Pindar, <title>Ol.</title>
5. 6), with the defence of Thermopylai
(7. 206), or with the Arkadian application
to the king, is very doubtful, all the
more as these two supposed synchronisms
conflict with each other! Stein's
note, however, on this passage still
remains as written under the exploded
hypothesis that the Olympiad coincided
with the first full moon after the summer
solstice, the last day of the festival in
480 B.C. being June 25. He therefore
transfers the scene of the Arkadian reception
to Therme, maintaining its
synchronism with the Olympiad, while
rightly dating the defence of Thermopylai
to the end of August or beginning
of September. But if the synchronism
of the Olympiad with the defence of
Thermopylai is to be abandoned as an
anachronism, why is the Olympiad in
this anecdote to be maintained as good
chronology? It is surely much more
probable that the Arkadian application
(assuming the anecdote to have any
truth in it) is correctly located at
Thermopylai, and correctly dated after
the Spartan fiasco there, than that the
very substance of the conversation, including
the Olympiad synchronism, is
precisely and exactly reproduced. However
that may be, and not to press the
distance from Arkadia to Macedon, the
revised calculation for the Olympiad
celebrations (Unger, <title>Philol.</title> 30, 1874,
227 ff.; A. Mommsen, <title>Ueber die Zeit der
Olympien,</title> 1891; cp. Busolt, ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 708)
makes the approximate synchronism of
Ol. 75, with the scenes laid at Thermopylai,
a sufficiently reasonable yet elastic
date to cover both cases. Cp. Appendix

neither quite complete nor perhaps quite

the Phokians over the Thessalians, the
more recent one apparently on Parnassos,
a <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezomaxi/a</foreign>, a <foreign xml:lang="greek">nuxtomaxi/a</foreign>, and apparently
a sortie of a besieged force, resulting in
a great victory, due to a ruse or stratagem
devised by their Eleian diviner Tellias.
This great victory is commemorated,
according to Hdt., by splendid offerings
at Delphi and at Abai. The other victory,
in the pass by Hyampolis, and at
a previous date, where they discomfit the
Thessalian cavalry, also by a stratagem
or ruse, the authorship of which is not
specified (c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), appears of less
moment, and is not espeeially commemorated
at Delphi, or even at Abai,
in the immediate neighbourhood; otherwise,
despite Hdt.'s assertion, we might
have been tempted to conjecture that
the <foreign rend="ital">anathema</foreign> at Abai was in reality a
commemoration of the victory at Hyampolis.</p>
<p>Polyainos
6. 18 narrates the two Phokian
stratagems against the Thessalians
in the same order as Hdt., without
adding any point, and even omitting
the Eleian <foreign rend="ital">mantis.</foreign> Pausanias in the
<title>Phokika</title> (10. 1) gives a much fuller
aceouut of these transactions. According
to the <title>Periegete</title> there were four battles,
the second and third of which are not
represented by anything in Hdt., while
the first and fourth correspond to the
two engagements in Hdt., restored to
their proper order. Pausanias reeords
first (i.) the battle by Hyampolis, and
the disaster to the Thessalian cavalry
caused by the eoncealed jars (c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>).
It appears, however, to be an indecisive
affair, for (ii.) the Thessalians at onee
prepare to invade Phokis on a far larger
scale (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sunele/xqhsan a)po\ tw=n po/lewn
pasw=n</foreign>), a project which strikes terror
into the Phokians, especially as the
cavalry is chiefly in evidence. After
eonsulting the Delphic oracle they
despatch, under cover of night, 300
picked men, led by Gelon, to reconnoitre;
but this force is trampled and cut to
pieces by the Thessalian eavalry. (iii.)
This disaster leads to a desperate resolve:
the Phokians determine to conquer or
to die, after devoting withal their wives,
children, and all their properties to the
flames. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nti\ tou/tou me\n a(/panta ta\</foreign>
<pb n="394"/>
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/lghta bouleu/mata a)po/noia u(po\ *(ellh/nwn
o)noma/zetai *fwkikh/</foreign>. The Phokians
march out under two generals, an
Ambrosian named Rhoios and Daiphantes
of Hyampolis, the former in command
of the infantry, the latter of the horse.
This expedition is accompanied by Tellias
of Elis, on whom the hopes of the
Phokians were fixed. The result of their
desperate courage was a brilliant victory,
and the oracle was justified; but where
exactly the battle took place, and what
service on the occasion Tellias performed,
is not specified. The same story is
told, with some important additions, by
Plutarch, <title>Mor.</title> 244; see notes to c. 29
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> (iv.) Subsequently, when the
two armies were laagered opposite each
other, <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\ th\n e)s th\n *fwki/da e)sbolh/n</foreign>,
the stratagem of Tellias came off. Taking
advantage of a full moon, 500 picked
men, their arms and persons whitened
with chalk, surprised the Thessalians,
and slew an immense number. Pausanias
describes two monuments at Delphi as
records of these events. One he connects
with the great but anonymous Phokian
victory, (iii.) <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)po\ tou/tou de\ tou=

<p>Assuming that the first group here
mentioned was identical with the <foreign rend="ital">anathema</foreign>
previously described, there were,
aceording to Pausanias, at Delphi only
two groups commemorating Phokian
victories over Thessalians. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) There was
the work of Aristomedon of Argos, which
represented Tellias, Rhoïos, Daiphantes,
and possibly other <foreign xml:lang="greek">strathgoi/</foreign> (Gelon, for
example?), together with certain local
Phokian heroes. This eommemorated
the great victory over the Thessalian
cavaliers, numbered (iii.) above, but not
recorded by Hdt. at all: these figures
were apparently of bronze. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) There
was the group, various figures in which
had been wrought by Diyllos, Amyklaios,
and Chionis, all Korinthians, to
commemorate apparently the success
enumerated as (iv.) above, and identical
with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezomaxi/a</foreign> of Hdt. in which
the ruse of Tellias the Eleian was
brilliantly successful. This anathema
represented a contest between Herakles
and Apollon for possession of the divining
stool or tripod, Leto and Artemis
supporting Apollon, and Athena backing
Herakles. To this group Hdt. apparently
refers.</p>
<p>Though Pausanias is more explicit
than Hdt., it by no means follows that
we are to adopt his account of the war
<foreign rend="ital">simpliciter;</foreign> nor is a partial harmony
between the two out of compass. Hdt.
records two Phokian victories over the
Thessalians and but one Delphian monument,
the work apparently of the
Korinthian school, and commemorating
the night battle, which, though he
describes it first, he has previously
introduced as <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ u(/staton trw=ma</foreign>. On
this point, then, Hdt. and Pausanias
are at one. For the victory which he
records over the Thessalian cavalry Hdt.
mentions no monument. Pausanias,
however, also, on his own showing, is
a monument short, for he records three
Phokian vietories over the Thessalians,
two of them victories over the cavalry,
and has but two monuments to describe,
the one commemorating a victory over
the Thessalian cavalry ‘in a second
engagement’—plainly the one numbered
(iii.) above—a victory, the story of
which is, on the face of it, as above
indicated, full of improbabilities. The
solution lies near, that Pausanias (or
his source) has duplicated the vietory
over the Thessalian cavalry. There was
only one victory over the cavalry, as
<pb n="395"/>
described by Hdt. and by Pausanias
himself, (1.) <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> it was in honour
of this victory that the group by Aristomedon
of Argos was dedieated, and we
may fairly conjecture that the stratagem
by whieh the cavalry was discomfited
was due to the ingenuity of Tellias.
The error in Pausanias ean even be
explained. As Hdt. had recorded this
engagement without assigning a monument
to it, a victory had to be invented
in order to account for the presenee of
a second monument at Delphi. The
omission by Hdt. of any mention of
the monument is no doubt a diffieulty;
but a monument there was.</p>
<p>The only crux remaining is the occurrence
in Pausanias of the disaster to the
Phokians under Gelon, omitted by Hdt.
This episode has an air of verisimilitude,
and need not be dismissed as merely a
set-off to the victory of the ‘Six Hundred.’
Its omission by Hdt. is easily aceounted
for by the eonsideration that he is
merely describing the grievances of the
Thessalians against the Phokians, a list
from which Thessalian victories might
fairly be omitted. A combination, then,
gives a more complete and a more correct
view of the war than either source taken
alone. The war comprised three great
episodes: (i.) A Phokian victory over
the Thessalian cavalry, commemorated
at Delphi by the group above described
as the work of the Argive, Aristomedon.
(ii.) A Thessalian victory over the
Phokians, under Gelon; probably a
much more extensive affair than the
record suggests, (iii.) A second Phokian
victory, due, like the first, chiefly to
a stratagem devised by Tellias, and
commemorated at Delphi in the group
wrought by the Korinthian school.</p></div>

Stein sees in this phrase a possible reference

Euryloehos the Aleuad, played a promment
part; the reference would be
absolutely unique, for nowhere else in
the work of Hdt., not even in the
passages on Kleisthenes of Sikyon, the
Alkmaionidai, Solon, is there the slightest
hint of the great subject. One must
ruefully acquiesee in the alternative that
the reference is, at most, to the general
superiority of the Thessalians to the
Phokians in the Delphic or Pylian
Amphiktyony—albeit that would unconseiously
eover the case of the Sacred

not very effieient, according to his
showing. Hdt.'s attitude towards the
Thessalians appears in contrast strongly
favourable: according to him they, in
the first instance, espoused the Greek
cause, and only afterwards ‘medized’
under ‘necessity’; cp. 7. 172. <bibl n="Paus. 10.1">Pausanias
10. 1</bibl> contradicts Hdt. by representing
the Phokians as in the first
instance compounding with the Persians,
and afterwards reverting to the national
cause. This representation of the case
might be due to an inference from the
conduct of the Thessalians, as reported
by Hdt., coupled with the judgement
of Hdt. in the present passage. Or
could there be any connexion between
the conduct of the Phokians and the
policy and fortunes of Delphi? The
Phokians at least talked big, or reported
themselves as so doing; but their positive
services to the Greek cause are not
very clear. If Delphi escaped their
fate, its escape may have been due to
the very different attitude of the
Thessalians (and other medizing states)
to Phokis and to the Amphiktyonic
shrine. Considering how decidedly Hdt.
‘atticizes,’ his attitude towards the
Phokians is the more remarkable.

incidentally, c. 28. This western pass
(running north and south) led over
from the plain of the Spercheios and
the Asopos to the upper plain of the
Kephisos, and so to Delphi, and further.
It has been identified above, 7. 176,
notes, with <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( dia\ *trhxi=nos e)/sodos e)s th\n

apparently (mis)applies to Thermopylai.
However that may be, in the present
context Hdt. undoubtedly carries the
whole Persian land-forces by this route,
and by this route alone, from the banks
of the Spercheios to the banks of the
Kephisos. That is a manifestly absurd
proceeding. One Persian column, of
course, marched by Thermopylai, Kleonai,
Hyampolis, and so forth. But what we
have here to be thankful for is the
clear indication that another column
(probably more lightly equipped) made
its way direct from Trachis into Doris.
The cavalry may all have passed by
the easier route to Hyampolis (cp. the
Thessalian case c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). There is
no clear indication of the continued
tripartition of the Persian forces (unless
c. 34 contains it obscurely), but probably
the system was maintained (unless
one whole <foreign rend="ital">corps d'armée</foreign> had remained
behind in Makedon and Thrace). Perhaps
while one column crossed by the
Asopos gorge or Trachinian pass, and
another followed the coast-route and
then turned inland to Hyampolis, a
third may have made its way across the
hills, between the two, by the modern
<title>Boudonitza</title>—then, as now, a sufficiently

easy route (as I found to my own

bringing all the Dorians in the Peloponnesos
from this ‘metropolis’ (and

questions, too large to discuss here in

The fact that the name of the Dorians
attaches itself to this Dryopis, and to
this place alone on the whole map of
Greece, is at least proof of a genuinely
Dorian character in the folk of that
place. In 457 B.C. the Phokiaus invaded

Its site is identified (Leake ii. 82, Bursian

the outlet of the pass of Hyampolis
(c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). Its strategic importance

actual scene of the Thessalian defeat
(cp. Plutarch, <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) a little
higher up the pass, was presumably a
dependency of Hyampolis; remains of
Hyampolis are identifiable (Leake ii. 167,
Bursian i. 165, Frazer v. 442). The
city would be the first exposed to the
attack of a force coming from Thermopylai,
and probably in 480 B.C. (with
Abai) was destroyed, not by the Persian
column which had crossed from Malis
into Doris, and then worked down the
Kephisos valley, spreading ruin and
death wherever it came, but by the
main column, which must have advanced
from Thermopylai along the coast, and
through the pass of Hyampolis.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*parapotami/ous</lem></app>. Parapotamioi
appears in Pausanias' list of the Phokian

The more careful modern <foreign rend="ital">periegetai</foreign> have
improved upon this. The site has been
identified in the narrow strait, between
Mounts Philoboiotos and Hadyleion,
through which the Kephisos passes from
the plain of Elateia to the plain of
Chaironeia (Leake ii. 97, Bursian i. 164,
Frazer v. 418). The order in which Hdt.
names Hyampolis, Parapotamioi and Abai
is not geographical in either direction.
Abai is probably placed last, because
there is a note to add to the name.
<pb n="404"/>
Hyampolis and Parapotamioi are then in
the order in which they would have been
visited by a force coming from Opûs.
Cp. also next chapter.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="5">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)/abas</lem></app>: Abai was plainly situate
lower down the (Assos) valley than
Hyampolis, <bibl n="Paus. 10.35.1">Pausan. 10. 35. 1</bibl>. Its
site is clearly identified (Leake ii. 164,
Bursian i. 165, Frazer v. 436 with plans).
Hyampolis, the city of the Hyantes, was
also known as Hya: and it is possible
that Abai was the city of the Abantes;
Abantopolis! But the statement of
Aristotle <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Strabon. 445 that the old
name of Euboia, viz. Abantis, was traceable
to Thrakians, who crossed over into
the island from Abai, in Phokis, is not
convincing. The chief claim of Abai
to renown was no doubt its Apolline
oracle.</p></div>

of Kroisos, 1. 46. It is a little remarkable
that Hdt. does not specify this point
here, especially in view of the notice in

this passage originally he was not yet
acquainted with the story of the Trial
of the Oracles, in other words, his silence
here makes for the earlier composition

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">diakrinome/nh h( stratih\ au)tw=n

there was a new departure. Hitherto
the army has advanced, according to
him, in a single column, from Thermopylai,
<foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Doris, and the upper valley
of the Kephisos, through the pass at
Parapotamioi, to Panopeus. At this
point, however, a division of the forces
takes effect. One column, the smaller
one, is detached for service against
Delphi; the other, and larger portion
of the army, advances with Xerxes into
Boiotia, and so to Attika. It has been
already shown that from Thermopylai
the Persians must have advanced in at
least two, and possibly even in three,
columns; cp. cc. 28, 31 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Two of
these columns would naturally have reunited
at Parapotamioi, or at Panopeus, unless
indeed the left column in the advanee
crossed the mountain direct by the road
from Hyampolis and Abai to Orchomenos
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( e)pi\ *)opou=nta lewfo/ros h\ e)c *)orxomenou=</foreign>
of <bibl n="Paus. 10.35.1">Pausanias 10. 35. 1</bibl>). As the main
baggage-train and cavalry probably came
by the coast route from Thermopylai,
this alternative seems the less probable.
Parapotamioi, then, may be looked upon
as the probable <foreign rend="ital">rendezvous</foreign> of the two
columns from Thermopylai, that which
devastated upper Phokis, and that which
visited Hyampolis and Abai (and possibly
other places on Mount Knemis). The
columns thus reunited may have passed
from Parapotamioi to Panopeus. From
Panopeus too a column may have been
detached to visit Delphi, as here narrated;
but the story of the visit to
Delphi is in itself open to the gravest
suspicion (see further below), and it is
even possible that, if the Persians ever
visited Delphi at all, Panopeus was not
the point of departure, but the point of
reunion, for the forces. The start for
Delphi might have been made from
Trachis, or from Doris, and the route
followed might have been by Amphissa
to Delphi, and from Delphi down to
Panopeus. The specification of Amphissa,
c. 32 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> as the chief refuge for the
Phokians, is against this hypothesis,
though the exeellence of the route is in
its favour. Or, again, the Persian
column, operating in the upper Kephisos
valley, might have detached a force at
Lilaia—so curiously omitted by Hdt.—
to go straight across Parnassos to Delphi.

<bibl n="Paus. 10.33.3">Pausan. 10. 33. 3</bibl></cit>. The Persian force
would then have rejoined the main body
at Daulis, or Panopeus. One admission
the Heiodotean story makes: it shows
a vague consciousness that through
Central Greece the Persian forces had
not moved all along in one single mass,
on one single route.</p></div>

the designation of the whole,
followed by the designation of the part
(ep. c. 23 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). From Panopeus one
road led west to Daulis (cp. next c.)
and so to (or from) Delphi; another
east to Chaironeia, little more than a
couple of miles (twenty stades) distant.
The actual frontier between
Phokis and Boiotia must be sought in
this interval; Bursian (<foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> i. 167)
finds it in the bed of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*mo/los</foreign> or
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*mw/rios</foreign>, a small torrent descending from
the north-western portion of Helikon
aud emptying into the Kephisos at the
foot of Mount Hadyleion (Plutarch,
<title>Sulla,</title> 17, 19). Hdt. does not mention
Chaironeia, which was not at this time
politically an important place, nor even
an independent member of the Boiotian
Confederacy (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.76.3">Thuc. 4. 76. 3</bibl>), but
stood, probably, to Orchomenos in much
the same relation as that between Kleonai
and Hyampolis in Phokis (cp. c. 33
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). Orchomenos was still no doubt
the chief city in the western (or northwestern)
plain of Boiotia, though fallen
from its high estate in ‘Minyan’ times,
and now inferior in politieal importance

the political significance of this statement
is ambiguous; is <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa=n to\ plh=qos</foreign>,
<foreign rend="ital">plebs universa,</foreign> in distinetion to the
aristocracy? Or is it merely <foreign rend="ital">universa
multitudo,</foreign> the vast majority, independent
of social rank, or political privilege?
Again, what is the force and value of
the contrast between <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ plh=qos</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s
po/lis</foreign>? Is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign> wholly outside the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/leis</foreign>? Is it merely the <foreign rend="ital">plebs</foreign> or <foreign rend="ital">multitudo
rustica?</foreign> Or is there any emphasis
on the distinction? Or are the <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/leis</foreign>
specifically the citadels?</p>
<p>Baehr understands <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos</foreign> here as
<foreign rend="ital">plebs,</foreign> and takes the point to be that the
rustic population, which was ‘plebeian,’
joined the Persians, while the cities, inhabited
or held by the upper classes,
were anti-Persian, but were saved from
Persian vengeance by the good offices of
the Makedonians. But this use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\
plh=qos</foreign> is hardly Herodotean (even 3.
80, 81 <foreign xml:lang="greek">plh=qos a)/rxon, e)s to\ plh=qos fe/rein
to\ kra/tos</foreign> not quite justifying the supposed
political and social connotation of
the word, as used in this passage). And
again, that interpretation would not
square with the points in the PlataioTheban
argument in Thuc. 3. 53-67 (<foreign rend="ital">ex
hypothesi</foreign> 427 B.C.), where the Plataians
represent themselves, and that to the
oligarchic Spartans, as the only Boiotians
who had not medized; while the Theban
reply is not that only the democratic
multitude medized, but that the medism
of Thebes was due to the inner ring of
oligarchy (<foreign xml:lang="greek">dunastei/a o)li/gwn a)ndrw=n</foreign> 3.
62. 3).</p>
<p><foreign xml:lang="greek">*boiwtw=n pa=n to\ plh=qos</foreign> here is, therefore,
to be understood ‘the Boiotians
without (or with hardly) an exception.’
But Thespiai and Plataia were, of course,
exceptions: perhaps, however, they were
not truly ‘Boiotians.’</p></div>

the absence of the patronymic is to be
observed. Alexander is treated as a
known quantity; the article is equally
absent, for he has not been named
recently; but this passage could not be
his first introduction: cp. 7. 173, 175.
These Makedonian garrisons appear to
have been sent on ahead.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th=|de</lem></app>, ‘for this purpose.’ Hdt.
ascribes to the men (<foreign xml:lang="greek">boulo/menoi</foreign>) what
must have been the wish and policy of
their master. This good understanding
between Alexander and the Boiotians,
i.e. primarily the Thebans, throws considerable
doubt upon the loyalty of
Thebes and Boiotia to the national cause
in the first instance. But the precautions
taken to save them from
pillage, if necessary, would show, either
that the Persian forces were getting out
of hand, or that the Boiotians had really
made a stand at Thermopylai, and
provoked the enemy.</p>
<p>It is, however, quite possible that
here, as elsewhere, while the <foreign rend="ital">act</foreign> is
historical, the <foreign rend="ital">motive</foreign> is fictitious.
Makedonian garrisons may have been
introduced into the Boiotian cities, not
for the purpose of saving them from the
Persians, but for the purpose of saving
the medizing factions from the loyal or
‘hellenizing’ party. The curious turn
of phrase, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ti ta\ *mh/dwn *boiwtoi\ frone/oien</foreign>,
‘that there were Boiotians of the Medes'

geographical position of Delphi hardly
requires elucidation, in general: situate
on a sloping edge, or shelf of rock, 2000
feet above the sea, backed by sheer cliffs
of Parnassos, with the gorge of the Pleistos
immediately below walled in by the
ridge of Kirphis, with the fertile plain of
Amphissa, of Kirrha, beyond, in full view
of the Krissaian bay, and sighting the
Arkadian mountains that tower beyond
the Korinthian gulf, Delphi yields in
natural charms and grandeur of aspect
and prospect to no landscape in Hellas!
It is accessible from three directions:
(i.) The easiest route comes up from the
sea, across the plain, and the steep spu&lt;*&gt;s
of Parnassos, half a day's journey. (ii.)
Behind Delphi, up over the western
heights and glades of Parnassos, runs
the path to Lilaia (<title>Agoriani</title>) in the
valley of the Kephisos, cp. c. 33 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
(iii.) Away to the east goes the better
route, first rising and then descending,
from Delphi to Boiotia, forking after a
while (the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sxisth\ o(do/s</foreign>!), the right path
running on to Lebadeia, the left to
Daulia, Panopeus, and so on into
Boiotia, cp. l. 4 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> It is by this
last route that Hdt. would have us conceive
the Persian column approaching
the shrine. <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ i(ro/n</foreign> was of course the
fabric of the Alkmaionidai: 5. 62. On
all that concerns the topography and
archæology of the place cf. Frazer's

into Doris, and then marched down the

if accepted as final, not merely the
advance on Delphi by the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*puqia/s</foreign> or
sacred road from the north, <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Amphissa,
but also an advance from Lilaia across
Parnassos, by which the highest points
of Parnassos would still have lain to
the left. Hdt., believing Panopeus to
be the point of departure, naturally says
they marched with Parnassos on their
right, and, he might have added, with
Helikon and Kirphis on their left.</p></div>

<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=nde ei(/neka</lem></app>. The political position
and relations of the oracle at the
time are of vital importance as bearing
upon the story of the Persian visitation
in 480 B.C. In the <title>Iliad</title> Pytho, or
Python, is apparently as much a Phokian
city as Daulis or Panopeus, Hyampolis
or Lilaia (2. 517 ff.), which proves, <foreign rend="ital">inter
alia,</foreign> that the <title>Catalogue</title> is older than
the First Sacred War. That war, waged
by the ‘Amphiktyons’ on behalf of the
Delphians, raised or secured the panHellenic
significance of the oracle, and
donbtless emancipated it completely from
Phokian leading. Whether an Ionian
(Athens-Sikyon) or a Dorian (Sparta)
or a Thessalian influence thereafter predominated
may be matter of dispute;
but the Phokians at least were but one
among the Amphiktyonic folks. The
war with the Thessalians, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) polloi=si
e)/tesi pro/teron tau/ths th=s basile/os strathlasi/hs</foreign>
c. 27 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> may have had something
of the character of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ero\s polemo/s</foreign>,
although never so described. It cannot,
however, be supposed that on the eve
of the Persian war the Delphic oracle
had sunk again to be a mere member
of the Phokian League, or a mere organ
of Phokian policy; the continuous notices
of the oracle's action and utterances,
from the date of the destruction of the
temple in 548 B.C. to the Persian war, forbid
that hypothesis. Or even if Phokian
influence had been predominant, at least
as against Thessalian, would the Thessalians
have aimed at the destruction of
the Amphiktyonic shrine, and not rather
at the re-establishment of their own influence
in Delphi, as commissaries and
protégés of the Persian? The national
Phokian oracle was at Abai; hence its
treatment, c. 33 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Delphi was the
concern of twelve peoples, of whom nine
were now on the king's part, the Thessalians
<foreign rend="ital">imprimis.</foreign> Clearly the Thessalians
cannot have taken the Persians to Delphi

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)pode/caien ta\ xrh/mata</lem></app>, ‘might
exhibit, display, the objects of value’
(not merely money). The assumption
appears to be that they would pillage
the temple, bring away the things, and
exhibit them to the king—when they
had overtaken him. Some of the things
would have been rather difficult to
transport, especially by that route!
And would the king have been content
merely to be a spectator of the show?
If so, his best way was to go to Delphi
in person and see for himself. The
phrase might suggest that course as the
one actually taken; but as in the sequel
the Persians were utterly discomfited
and routed, and no such disaster was
or could be reported of the king himself,
did the Delphic apologist discreetly
suppress the visit of the Persian king?</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pa/nta d' h)pi/stato <gap/> e)/lipe</lem></app>:
this assertion would read less like a
gross exaggeration if Xerxes had, indeed,
visited Delphi, and seen the temple and
its treasures with his own eyes. Otherwise
the statement is a frigid absurdity,

the cautious asseveration <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s e)gw\ punqa/nomai</lem></app>.
Where could Hdt. have convinced
himself by inquiry of this absurdity if
not in Delphi itself? The Delphian
visitation is obviously from a Delphian
source, and the story of it, a patent
apology for the attitude of Delphi in
the war, is an obvious insertion in the
main draft of the history. Cp. Introduction,

This temple has now been identified by

xxi. (1901) 347. It was the last of five
buildings on the left of the road from
Arachova to Delphi, which formed an
important group, or row, outside the
Pythian sanctuary itself, at a spot known
as the <title>Marmaria,</title> halfway between the
<title>Logari</title> and the <foreign rend="ital">gymnasium.</foreign> The first
of these buildings was in ruins at the
time of Pausanias, the other four he
mentions. The temple of Athene is now
identified, not with the Rotunda or
<foreign rend="ital">tholos</foreign> (as by Laurent), but with a
temple <foreign rend="ital">in antis,</foreign> built of local limestone,
the last of the five (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pente/loipos</foreign>!)

admire the courage with which Delphi,
when censured for its escape in the
Persian war, knew how to defend itself.
It is likely that the critique had been
mainly an Athenian one; if so, Delphi
called Athene Pronaia herself as chief
witness for the defence, and Athene
Pronaia, or Pronoia, was justified of her
children. Cp. Appendix III. § 4.</p>

The story is verily a test one; it is one
<pb n="415"/>
of the most transparent fictions in Hdt.,
though one that fully imposed on the
good man himself. The early Victorian
rationalists made sad work of it, of
whom the Rev. Professor Rawlinson
may in this case be taken as typical.
He (iv.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> 291) interprets the story as
follows: — (1) The fragments of rock
“were carefully prepared beforehand,”
and precipitated by the men on the
“peaks.” (2) In falling the rocks
made a noise, which was mistaken for
“thunder.” (3) The armour in front
of the temple was arranged by a priest.
(4) The war-cry was a shout from
another priest. (5) The heroes were
impersonated by “two men of unusual
stature,” or (6) may have been “a mere
excuse” made to Xerxes by his men.
Such is the last word of unhistorical
criticism upon uncritical history. It
may not be possible to determine exactly
what took place at Delphi in 480 B.C.,
or whether the Persians had any direct
relations with Delphi, or ever visited
it at all; but two points may here at
least be urged. (i.) The story just examined
(cc. 35-39) is evidently <foreign rend="ital">apologetic,</foreign>
i.e. told and devised in order to explain
the suspicious escape of Delphi in the
war. (ii.) It must not be isolated, and
considered merely on its own merits,
but must be brought into relation with
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the evidences in regard to the whole
attitude and policy and action of Delphi
throughout the great crisis, and even in
other similar crises; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the evidences
for the policy of the Persians towards
the Greeks, and especially towards the
‘medizers,’ who were as much interested
in Delphi as any others; (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) the accounts
preserved in Pausanias (1. 4. 4, 10. 23)
of the attack of the Gauls upon Delphi
in the year 279 B.C., and the part played
by the ‘divine’ in that second deliverance.
For an attempt to appreciate
the story from that point of view cp.

The Greek fleet might well

assumed that in the conception of
Hdt. and his sources the station at
Salamis was no part of the general plan
of defence, but an after-thought, and an
impromptu. To what extent is this
assumption binding? What event called
for an improvisation? The failure at
Thermopylai? Or the non-appearance
of the Peloponnesian forces in Boiotia?
Had the full levy of the land-forces
been, as was expected, already north of
Kithairon, or even of the Isthmos, where
better could the Greek fleet have halted
than in the straits of Salamis? What
appears to have taken the Athenians by
surprise was that a situation had been
allowed to arise in which the complete
evacuation of Attica had become at
least an open question. It is here that I
would insert the story of the consultation
of the Delphic oracle told, anachronistically,
7. 140-143 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=nde de\ ei(/neka</lem></app>. Hdt.'s motivation
in this passage is curious, and perhaps
involves a <foreign rend="ital">hysteron-proteron.</foreign> He treats
the evacuation of Attica as a foregone
conclusion, and the problem of the <foreign rend="ital">quid

all that and much more (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to/</foreign>, of course,

been in Boiotia (as was expected), the
evacuation of Attica would not have
been in question, but Salamis might still
have been the natural halting-place for
the fleet, covering, as it would have
done, the land-forces in Boiotia from
the rear, or flank. But so far from the
<pb n="416"/>
complete evacuation of Attica being a
self-obvious necessity, it was even now
not really adopted or fully carried out,
cp. c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Moreover, there would
be the question, even in the case of the

<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), to what place or places they were
to be conveyed. These are all matters
for separate deliberation by the Athenians
alone (it is not possible to refer <foreign xml:lang="greek">auu)toi\</foreign>

they leave the purely strategic plan of

news that the Peloponnesians, instead of
being in full force beyond Kithairon, are

required formal deliberation, and the

must have been good reason for this

more than the supposition that
the Peloponnesians might reasonably
have been expected to be on the march
for Thermopylai: <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu(rh/sein, pandhmi/, u(pokathme/nous</foreign>,
all go beyond that. The
participle here scarcely implies an ambuscade,
but it certainly implies a settlement
or resting-place; cp. 7. 27. The
adverb signifies the <foreign rend="ital">levée en masse</foreign> such
as afterwards fought at Plataia; the
verb may have an immaterial or purely
psychological force (as <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)=ron</foreign> just below),
i.e. ‘to find that the Peloponnesians’
etc., or a less figurative and more
material meaning (‘to find the Peloponnesians
posted in wait for the barbarian

The story told c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> makes
it probable that the evacuation of Attica

passage is not free from ambiguity. Are
we to understand that an actual majority
of Athenian households were sent across
to Troizen? Or, merely, that the
number at Troizen was larger than either
the number in Aigina, or the number in
Salamis? That any should have been
deposited in Aigina at all is remarkable,
in view of the recent war (7. 144) and
the present jealousies (c. 92 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>);
that any should have remained in
Salamis but fighting men would tend
to show that the Athenians by no means
despaired of victory. The historic connexion
between Athens and Troizen
went back to the days when both were
members of the Kalaurian amphiktyony
(Strabo 204), to which Aigina also had
belonged; and the mythic associations
were no doubt deepened by the Theseuslegend,
which was already fully domiciled
in Attica. No state in Peloponnese
was so closely connected with Athens
as Troizen, which even used the Attic
standard of weight; there too Athene
and Poseidon had contended for possession
and divided the spoil; cp. Head,
<title>H.N.</title> 371. Yet Troizen, like Aigina,
was Dorian; cp. 7. 99 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> 9. 28 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>

But how long had the cake remained
untouched? Did it generally disappear
immediately on oblation? The serpent,
as a religious symbol or cult-object, is
found broad-cast in Hellas and the
Mediterranean area; nor is it confined
to that region; serpent-myths were
“specially a bundant in Egypt and Babylonia”
(<title>Encycl. Bibl.</title> iv. 4395), and their
area may safely be extended so as to
include at least India on the one side
and Scandinavia on the other. Whether
it have a chthonian or an autochthonous
reference, embody an oracular mission,
or represent the heroic ancestor, be
intended to convey a phallic suggestion,
or be connected with the charm and
mystery of the lithest and subtlest of
animal forms; or whether, on the other
hand, it serve, in venomous kind, to
typify the powers of evil and destruction:
whatever its purpose and significance,
the serpent has played a long and
curious rôle in religious legend and
symbolism. Has it not everywhere
gained admission? Remarkably enough,
the serpent scarcely figures on the
monuments of ‘Mykenaean Tree and
Pillar cult’ collected by A. J. Evans
(<title>J.H.S.</title> xx. 1900, p. 52), but the
missing link has been recently supplied
(<title>Annual Br. Sch. Ath.</title> ix. 1902-3). At
Knossos snakes are now to be seen
brandished aloft by the Minoan goddess
in her star-chamber (is she not Aphrodite
Urania? cp. Hdt. 1. 105). At Delphi
the dragon (there, then, an evil being)
was slain, but immortalized, by Apollo.
At Athens the goddess received the
snake into her service; it curled round
the caducens of Heimes and the magie
<pb n="419"/>
or medicinal waud of Asklepios. The
serpent inspired the oracle of Tiophonios
at Lebadeia, and dominated the legend
of Kadmos at Thebes; appeared in the
ritual of Demeter at Eleusis, and contends
with the eagle of Zeus on the
coins of Elis. The god visited Olympias,
the mother of Alexander, in the
form of a snake (Plutarch, <title>Alex.</title> 2), and
twin-snakes led the son safely through
the wilderness to the temple of his
divine sire (Arrian, <title>A&lt;*&gt;ab.</title> 3. 3. 5). The
snake-symbol, the  <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gaqo\s dai/mwn</foreign>, preserved
the walls of Pompeii (and many
another city) from impurity; the serpent
figures on the monuments of Mithras,
with the bull, the hound, and the
scorpion, as a sacred mystery. The
bronze serpent which, raised upon a
mast, had stayed the plague in the
wilderness for the Israelites, was worshipped
till a reforming king destroyed
the idol, and an idealizing legend
identified the serpent's image with the
Evil One, who had seduced the mother
of mankind beside the tree of knowledge.
Henceforth, for Hebrew and for orthodox
Christian thought the snake-symbol is
<foreign rend="ital">nehustan;</foreign> but the earlier associations
of tree and serpent were apparently
beneficent. As round the world-ash
in the <title>Edda</title> twines the great snake,
Igdrasil, so the Attic serpent may have
coiled round the sacred olive of Athene
in the Erechtheion; cp. the remarkable

the ‘Makedonian’ title to the Pindosstation,
and the ‘Dorian’ to Diyopis
only.</p>
<p>There is thus a discrepancy between
the two passages, at least upon the
<pb n="421"/>
second point; the phrase just below,
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(/stata o(rmhqe/ntes</lem></app>, may be taken to
cover the first point implicitly; and if
the text is to stand, we must suppose
that Hdt. (as not infrequently) lapsed
from forgetfulness into a slight inconsequence;
for an inconsequence it is,
even if Mount Pindos and the town of
the same name marked two stations
(separated by a considerable interval
both spatial and temporal) in the
Dorian migration. But are the words
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*pi/ndou kai/</lem></app> here a gloss, an insertion,
a reminiscence, by a mere transcriber
of 1. 56? Sense and grammar would
be complete without them, and the
inconsequence would disappear from the
author's text. Failing that solution,
we might delete <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai/</foreign> and read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pi/ndou th=s
*druopi/dos</foreign>.</p>
<p>The question in any case remains of
the repetition, the quasi - dittograph.
The composition of the two passages
was evidently separated by a considerable
interval; but which was the earlier?
Probably the fuller and completer passage
in Bk. 1 is of later composition in
the work of Hdt. Had it stood in its
place originally, as it now stands, in
relation to this, a reference here backwards
would have been natural and
sufficient, and in keeping with Hdt.'s
practice. This passage, then, distinctly
supports the theory that Bks. 7, 8, 9
are of earher composition than the first
and subsequent Books. Cp. Introduction,
§§ 7, 8.</p></div>

presents itself. This Makedonian station
for the Dorians is in truth as far back
as the chart or the story of the wandering

previous stages not only involve a
pragmatic blunder (the confusion of
Histiaiotis with Pelasgiotis, in order
to purge the Dorians of all taint of
‘barbarism’), but are also obviously
designed to bring back the Dorians to
the true fold and cradle of Hellenism

Doris-Dryopis than the Lepreatai from
Lemnos, unless, indeed, they came with
the Dorians. The people of Kythnos
too are ‘Dryopians,’ c. 46 <foreign rend="ital">infra;</foreign> and
there were ‘Dryopians’ on the Asiatic
side (cp. 1. 146). Karystos in Euboia
was ‘Dryopian,’ <bibl n="Thuc. 7.57.4">Thuc. 7. 57. 4</bibl>, and
also perhaps Styra (<bibl n="Paus. 4.34.11">Pausan. 4. 34. 11</bibl>,

Dryopians. That the name Dryopis was

back into Thessaly, seeing in the geographical
order of the Dryopian stations
—Styra, Karystos, Kythnos—the links
between the Malian and the Argolic
gulfs. But geography is not history,
and the historic inference from geographical
distribution is just the fallacy
committed in the Herodotean legend of
the Minyai, 4. 145 ff. The Dryopians,

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">mou=noi</lem></app>: by themselves alone, i.e.
without the Plataians, as the next sentence
explains. There was evidently a
problem: why were the Plataians, who
had assisted to man the Athenian
squadron at Artemision (c. 1 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>),
absent from Salamis? The reason
appears to be somewhat conjectural (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dia\
toio/nde ti prh=gma</lem></app>). They had landed
opposite Chalkis in order to remove their
households. The fact of the debarkation
is plainly indubitable; the reason for
the act is more doubtful. It implies
that the complete evaeuation of Plataia,
and therefore of Attica, had already been
resolved on. In the light of c. 40 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>
it is possible that the Plataians landed
in Boiotia expecting to find the Peloponnesian
army ready to eover and
defend Plataia: they would naturally
elect, and indeed be bound, to join the
land-forces under such circumstances
The removal was then neeessitated by
the non-appearance of the Greek army.
But had the Plataians been especially
eager for further service at sea, they
surely might have found a way of rejoining
the Athenians at Salamis. Had
the evacuation of Attica been already
decided on when the Athenians and
Plataians parted at Chalkis, surely
<pb n="423"/>
Sa amis would have been given as the
rendezvous. The Plataians did not perhaos
escape some censure at Athens;
there is some trace of an apologetic note
in this passage. Athenian tradition
had its revenge: this <foreign xml:lang="greek">mou=noi</foreign> became so
emphatic that it was sometimes forgotten
that the Plataians had fought

cp. Introduction, § 9).</p>
<p>The epitome which follows is the
quintessence of primitive Attic history.
Hdt. has taken it from some predecessor
(possibly Hekataios), though there were
perhaps already native <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)atqidogra/foi</foreign> at
work, cp. 6. 137. But this passage is
hardly of strict Attic provenience, nor
does it represent the orthodox Athenian
tradition or theory. An Athenian would
not have admitted Pelasgianism, nor
allowed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ke/krof</foreign> a merely secondary place,
nor described Ion as <foreign xml:lang="greek">strata/rxhs</foreign> (but
rather as <foreign xml:lang="greek">pole(marxos</foreign>) of Athens. In
this passage, as in 1. 57, the Athenians
are Pelasgians, virtually from first to
last, for the changes they have undergone
are merely, or mainly, nominal—a
change of names; but Hdt. does not
here go so far as to assert that they had
changed their language too, or that time
was when the Athenians, yea the Ionians,
spake a non-Hellenic tongue. The early
history of Attica, or at least of Athens,
is resumed in four stages, of which the
Ionian (with the Ionian tribes, and so
forth) was but the last, and imposed <foreign rend="ital">ab
extra.</foreign> Before there were Ionians there
had been Athenians; the Athenian is
older than the Ionian name—in Attica.
But the names of Kekrops and Kekropidai
are older still than the Athenian. So
fai back the stages, the epochs, are
marked by proper names, Ion, Erechtheus,
Kekrops. Before Kekrops there is a
dim Pelasgian prime, and the forbears
of the Athenian people, seemingly one
tribe or section of the Pelasgian stock,
were hight Kranaoi. But here it is the
difference rather than the identity
between Athenian and Pelasgian that is
emphasized.</p>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pi\ me\n *pelasgw=n e)xo/ntwn th\n

single consistent view on the ‘Pelasgian
question,’ regards the Pelasgoi as the
fore-Hellenic and non-Hellenic population
of all the continuous area afterwards
invaded and occupied by the Hellenes,
and so hellenized. Thus (i.) he places
Pelasgoi in Peloponnese (1. 146, 2. 171,
7. 94): in Attica (1. 56, 2. 51, 4. 145,
6. 137): N. Greece (2. 52, 56): in the
Islands (2. 51, 4. 145, 5. 26, 6. 136, 140):
Asia Minor (7. 42, 95); (ii.) he makes
Pelasgia the older name of the Hellenic
peninsula (2. 56); (iii.) he believes that the
Pelasgoi spake a non-Hellenic language
(1. 57). On this view many or most of
the early tribal names are subdivisions
of the Pelasgic stock: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ai)giale/es *pelasgoi)</foreign>
(7. 94), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kranaoi) *pelasgoi/</foreign>, and so forth;
the Dorians become the Hellenes <foreign xml:lang="greek">kat)
e)coxh/n</foreign>, and the area occupied by Hellenic
or hellenized tribes in the historic
period has, <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi,</foreign> becn occupied
in the prehistoric by non-Hellenie tribes,
exterminated or absorbed and hellenized
by the invaders, leaving only a few
isolated survivals here and there (1. 57).
But the case of Athens, where there
was no record of a Dorian conquest, is
a difficulty on this theory, though
Herodotus, the Dorian, nevertheless, or
perhaps for that very reason, represents
the Athenians as Pelasgic, without ever
explaining their adoption of Hellenism.
Thucydides, the Athenian, represents
an opposite, or at least a corrective and
rival view. He nowhere commits himself
to the doctrine of the non-Hellenic
character of the Pelasgoi, or the nonHellenic
character of their language.
Hellene and Pelasgian are not with him
alternative or exclusive terms at any
period; the distinction is merely nominal
and verbal. The Pelasgic is indeed
older than the Hellenic, but the Pelasgoi
are but one, the most considerable, of
many tribes inhabiting the potentially
Hellenic area (1. 3). The Hellenic
name is a matter of fashion, culture,
exchange, adoption. The exact relation
of Athens to the Pelasgoi is not clear.
It is possible that Thucydides did not
connect <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ *pelargiko/n</foreign> (2. 17) with the
Pelasgoi; but if the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ *)aqh/nas</foreign> in
4. 109. 4 are authentic (to me they have
the air of a gloss), Thucydides admitted
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*pelasgoi\ *turshnoi/</foreign> as quondam inhabitants
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)khsa/ntwn</foreign>) of Athens: an
excursion into the rival hypothesis! In
any case he will hardly have regarded
the Athenians as Pelasgoi in his own time,
much less allowed the Dorian claim to
the flower of ‘Hellenism.’</p>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*ke/kropos basile/os</lem></app>: for Thucydides,
at least, Kekrops is apparently
the first king in the land, 2. 15. 1, and
the only one named by him previous to
Theseus, though others are implied.
Hdt. here adds Erechtheus, and in 1.
173 supplies the names of Pandion and
Aigeus. Whether these four names
would have comprised for Hdt. the
complete list of Attic, or even of
Athenian, kings before Theseus it is not
easy to determine. As pointed out in
the previous note, Kekrops can hardly
be the first king for Hdt. What exact
date he would have assigned to Kekrops
must also remain an open question;
but here at least the period of the
Kekropidai is post-Pelasgian and praeIonian,
nay, even prae-Athenian!</p>
<p>‘Kranaos’ appears to be an epithet
localized, and then converted into a
tribe-name and a tribe-ancestor. The
eponym has here been generated from
the epithet Is the case to some extent
similar with ‘Kekrops’? The etymology
and meaning of Kekrops are, indeed,
obscure. G. Curtins ccnnected the word
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">karp-</foreign>, fruit, fruitful (vid. L. &amp; S.),
in which case the  <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ke/kropes, *kekro/pioi,
kekropi/dai</foreign>—terms all used = <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)aqhnai=oi</foreign>—
would be the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/dioi</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">pediai=oi</foreign>, under
another aspect (and contrast well with
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kranaoi/</foreign> as above explained). But
is not <foreign xml:lang="greek">ke/kroy</foreign> a variant of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ke/rkoy, ke/rkwy</foreign>,
the beast, or man, with the tail? (cp.
7. 216 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). It was under such a
form that Kekrops was found and worshipped
on the Akropolis; and the
serpentine image was, or became, symbolical
of the autochthonous claim; cp.
c. 41 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> <bibl n="Apollod. 3.14.1">Apollod. 3. 14. 1</bibl> probably
gives the orthodox Attic theory: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ke/kroy

<div type="commline" n="12">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)erexqe/os</lem></app>: of the true essence of
Erechtheus there need be comparatively
little doubt; he is one with Poseidon
(cp. c. 55 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), although, of course,
tradition, i.e. early speculation, divided
them, and then multiplied Erechtheus
by two, or more, into Erechtheus, Erichthonios,
in order the better to harmonize
discrepant legends. Etymologically he
is ‘the Render’ (cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)re/xqw, *poseidw\n
e)rexqeu/s</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)nnosi/gaios</foreign> (?), though the connexion
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">xqw/n</foreign> even in Erichthonios
is pseudetymology). Like Kekrops, with
whom he was sometimes, reasonably
enough, identified (cp. Eustath. p. 283,
<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Clinton, <title>Fasti,</title> i. (1834) p. 62a),
Erechtheus is in Attic legend <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toxqw/n</foreign>.
But his divinity is even more incontestable,
and he had his temple on the
Akropolis, in close association with
Athene; cp. above all Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.547"><title>Il.</title> 2.
547</bibl>. This close association accounts
for the <foreign rend="ital">metonomasia</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kekropi/dai</foreign>
to <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)aqhnai=oi</foreign> here associated with his
régime; not but what <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)erexqei=dai</foreign> is
found in the poets as an equivaleut,
Pindar, <title>Isth.</title> 2. 19, cp. <title>Pyth.</title> 7. 10;

Yet it is perhaps a pity that Hdt. did
not complete his schematic history of
Athenian titles by employing the term;
so would he have had ‘Athenians’ all
through as the common element underlying
Pelasgians, Kranaians, Kekropids,
Erechtheids, Ionians! Cp. App. Crit.</p></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)/iwnos de\ tou= *cou/qou</lem></app>. The conventional
pedigree of the sons of Hellen,
for which our oldest authority is the
Boiotian Hesiod (<title>Frag.</title> 25 = Rzach 7),
is everywhere presupposed in Hdt.,
even though the Hellenic character
of the Ionians is thus guaranteed, in
conflict with his theory (1. 56) of their
Pelasgic descent. The insertion of
Xuthos does, however, put Ion (and
Achaios) one step further from Hellen
than Doros (and Aiolos); unless, indeed,
with Euripides we make Doros
also a son of Xuthos. In Attica
Ion (and the Ionians) are immigrant,
not autochthonous (though Enripides
places his birth in one of the holy caves
under the Akropolis), and no Attic
tradition gave Ion a place in the suc<pb n="426"/>
cession of kings, though he is recognized
here (as in <foreign xml:lang="greek">*aqhn. pol.</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">l.c. infra</foreign>) as
war-leader, war-lord. Was there never
an Ionian conquest of or in Attica?
The Ionian elements in Attica seem
closely welded with the native, and yet
distinct (the analogy of Great Britain,
with its Saxons and Britons, is perhaps
admissible). In Attica, however, the
Ionian can hardly have been the aboriginal
element, and the ‘Athenian’ the immigrant,
albeit snch complete inversions
of the truth, such <foreign rend="ital">hystera protera,</foreign> are
found in Greek legend (cp. 4. 145). One
thing is clear: there was no ‘Norman,’
no Dorian conquest of Attica (cp. 5. 76
and my notes); and the settlement of
population in Attica went back to a
much more primitive date than in Peloponnese,
or in the rest of Central Greece;
hence the relative continuity of Attic
history and culture, the priority and
scale of the ‘Theseian’ synoikism</p></div>

without any express recognition of the
‘metropolitan’ character of Epidauros—
a contrast at least compatible with the
hypothesis that this note is of earlier
composition. That Aigina was a Dorian
island in the historic period is indubitable;
e.g. the not very numerous tituli
Aeginetici, Cauer, <title>Delectus</title><hi rend="sup">2</hi> No. 65-70,
E. S. Roberts, <title>Gk. Epigraphy</title> i. (1887)
§§ 57-59, and the uniform literary and
historical evidences from Pindar to
Pausanias. The date and circumstances
of its occupation by the Dorians, and
the piecise starting-point of the colonists,
are items of doubtful tradition and
speculation. Hdt. here traces the Dorian
colonists no further back than Epidauros;
in 1. 146 he mixes up Dorians of
Epidauros with the Ionian migration to
Asia Minor; the Dorization of Epidauros
itself he does not record. <bibl n="Paus. 2.29.5">Pausanias 2.

more than the port of departure; and
notwithstanding the air of antiquity
lent to the traditions, we may reasonably
doubt whether the Dorization of Aigina
was much more aneient than the age of
Pheidon, o&lt;*&gt; the dependence of Aigina
on Epidanros (5. 83) more than a
misconception of the relations of the
island to the Argive power under the
last of the Temenid kings of Argolis.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="5">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">th=| de\ nh/sw| <gap/> *oi)nw/nh</lem></app>. The
statement would suggest that the name
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ai(/gina</foreign> was of Dorian coinage; but it
belongs to a class of names (beginning
with <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ai)g-</foreign>) that go back long before
the coming of the Dorians, and Aigina
was the name of the island apparently
in the days of the Kalaurian Amphiktyony.
So, too, the tradition that Zeus
carried the nymph Aigina to the desert
island Oinone, where she became mother
of the first inhabitant Aiakos (<bibl n="Paus. 2.29.2">Pausan.
2. 29. 2</bibl>), pushes the proper name back
as far as the earliest population. The
form of the name given by Pindar <title>Isth.</title>

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">se\ d' e)s na=son *oi)nopi/an fe/rwn e)koima=to

4. 46, 5. 15, 8. 7, <title>Isth.</title> 4. (5.) 35). Is
the supposed ancient ‘name’ of the
island much more than an epithet
deranged? As in the parallel cases of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*kalli/sth *qh/ra</foreign> (4. 147), or <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sxeri/a</foreign> =
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*ko/rkura</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 2.5.2">Pausan. 2. 5. 2</bibl>), the supposed
original is more indubitably Greek, or
at least more transparently significant,
than the name of supposed later origin
—a point fatal to the asserted priority.
‘Oinone,’ too is known as a nymph,
the bride of Paris (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.12.6">Apollod. 3. 12 6</bibl> <foreign rend="ital">et
al.</foreign>); and the syllable <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)n-</foreign> is as common,
but is it also as ancient, as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)g-</foreign> in the

<p>On the Athenian origin of the Ionian
Naxians cp. l. 8 above. Naxos was
and had been a much more important
island than Keos, and had been held
to Athenian interests in the days of
Peisistratos (1. 64). Its rivalry with
Miletos at the end of the sixth cent.,
and party feuds within the island itself,
had led indirectly to the conflict between
the Ionians and Persia in which Athens
had become involved (5. 28, 31); and
though Naxos had escaped the first
assault upon its liberties from the
Asiatic side (5. 33), it had succumbed—
with the rest—to Datis and Artaphrenes
(6. 95 f.) in 490 B.C. For the decade
previous to Salamis its history is a
blank; but evidently Naxos had resigned
neither its ambitions nor its
party feuds.</p>

To Hdt. the prae-Dorian population of
the Peloponnesos was mainly or largely
‘Achaian’ (cp. 5. 72), a theory no doubt
in part based upon the Homeric poems.
The Achaians of historic Achaia had
apparently concentrated in what was
previously an Ionian province on the
north coast, and expelled the Ionians;
cp. 1. 145. From that Peloponnesian
Achaia, Achaians had apparently subsequently
migrated to southern Italy,
and made of it a great or greater Hellas.
To the Greeks of the fifth century the
Achaians were undoubtedly the most
genuine ‘Hellenes’ at least of earlier or
prae-Dorian days, and the prae-Dorian
culture, the culture of the Homeric
poems, of the heroic age, was in their
eyes an Achaian culture. The Achaian
name is found actually attached to the
soil of historic Hellas in two places,
south Thessaly and north Peloponnese,
and Achaians are with certainty to be
found in Krete, in south Italy, and even
as far as Kypros. How that could be, if
the Achaians were not Greeks at all,
but ‘a small Celtic tribe’ (Ridgeway,
<title>Early Age of Greece,</title> i. 1901) merged and
lost in the Hellenic mass, is an enigma.
Prof. Bury, who in his <title>History</title> (1900)
appears somewhat to minimize the
importance of the Achaians, and even of
the Hellenes, in Hellenic culture,
nevertheless proved (to my mind) the
virtual identity of Hellenes and Achaians
originally, and explained thereby the
strange origin of the designation of
‘Great Greece’ for the south of Italy,
which could only have been so called in
distinction to the lesser Hellas from
which the Achaian colonists had come—
a mere district of Peloponnese, or it may
be of Thessaly; cp. <title>J.H.S.</title> xv. (1895)

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">trih/reas <gap/> penthkonte/rous</lem></app>.
The ‘pentekonter’ was a war-galley,
no doubt open throughout, with 50
oars (25 each side), and probably not
less than 100 feet long (120 feet, cp.
Torr, <title>Ancient Ships,</title> p. 21). Its construction
in Greece dated to the beginning
of the seventh century if Thuc. 1. 13
is to be trusted (see C. Torr, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign>
p. 4); the Phaiakians, however, in the
<title>Odyssey</title> (8. 34 ff.) had such a vessel.
It was in pentekonters, according to
Hdt. 1 163, that the Phokaians made
their long voyages in the west, and that
the Theraians crossed to Libya to found
Kyrene in 630 B.C.; and in pentekonters,
according to <bibl n="Thuc. 1.13.6">Thuc. 1. 13. 6</bibl>, the Phokaians
defeated the Carthaginians off Massalia
about 600 B.C. Even the Athenian and
Aiginetan navies at the beginning of
the fifth century were mainly composed
of pentekonters, according to <bibl n="Thuc. 1.14.3">Thuc. 1.
14. 3</bibl>, and he even declares that most
of the vessels in which the Athenians
fought at Salamis were not fully decked,
<foreign rend="ital">ib.,</foreign> a statement which ill accords with
the large number of <title>Epibatai</title> carried.
He does not, however, expressly deny
that they were triremes.</p>
<p>Triremes were the rule in 480 B.C.,
according to Hdt. in this passage. He
elsewhere reckons 200 men as the crew,
or complement of rowers; cp. 7. 184
<foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> (The actual number of oars used
on the thre banks(?) of an Attic trireme
was 170 to 74, cp. Torr, <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign> p 10 f.,
and there night be thirty in reserve,
or supplement; for the precise allocation
of the oars cp. <foreign rend="ital">op. cit.</foreign>) The trireme
was something less than 150 feet long,
and less than 20 feet broad (cp. Torr,
p. 22)—measurements which may not
be quite precise for 480 B.C. Cp. also
M. A. Caitault, <title>La trière Athénienne,</title>

Hdt. says the Melians were
from Lakedaimon; he does not expressly
say that they were Dorian. Thuc. 5.
84, 2. 89, 106, fully recognizes them as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*lakedaimoni/wn a)/poikoi</foreign>, and seems to give
1116 B.C. as an approximate date for
the colonization in c 112 (416 + 700).
Judging by the parallel case of Thera
(Hdt. 4 148), the genuinely ‘Dorian’
element in the emigration will have been
very small; yet, like Thera, Melos used
a ‘Dorian’ alphabet and dialect (cp.
<pb n="433"/>
Roberts, <title>Greek Epigraphy,</title> §§ 19-23), a
fact which no doubt would favour the
‘Lakedaimonian’ legend.</p></div>

and raised to 380 by the addition of the
Tenian vessel which joined at Salamis,

here is therefore certain. Yet it exceeds
the items, which amount only to 366,
by 12. There is therefore something
wrong with the items. Valckenaer
would have read 42 for the Aiginetans,
c. 46 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> this agrees with the statement
of Pausanias that next to the
Athenians the Aiginetans supplied most
ships. The repetition of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">trih/konta</foreign>
need not bar this emendation; if the
figure was once corrupted, it would be
corrected in the other case in the light
of the corruption. Moreover, this bolder
emendation is preferable to the insertion
of 12 for the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/llai ne/es</foreign>, first because
the list is not a list of all the ships in
commission, but only of those which
fought at Salamis; secondly, because 42
is rather a low figure for the absolute
sum of the Aiginetan navy, all told;
while if 42 were at Salamis, and 18 in
service at home, we get a total of 60
ships in commission, which is a more
probable figure for Aigina at this time.
If the Aiginetan 30 were to be maintained
for Salamis we should have to
tinker one or more of the other items.
K. O. Mueller, <title>Aeginetica,</title> p. 122, suggested
reading <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sikuw/nioi de\ pentekai/deka
parei/xonto pleu=nas</foreign>, i.e. 12 + 15, raising
the Sikyonian contingent from 12
(Artemision) to 27, which is less ingenious
than Gutschmid's compromise
to raisc Troizen from 5 to 7, and the
Aiginetans from 30 to 40.</p>
<p>Hdt. evidently finds it necessary to
account for the smallness of the Aiginetan
contingent by the remark that it was
by no means all the ships they had in
commission; but Rawlinson, in supposing
that they had 40 on guard off
their own island, while maintaining 30
at Salamis, seems to go too far; the
majority of the Aiginetan navy, like
that of every other Greek state, was at
Salamis. The variant 358 is quite
worthless; cp. App. Crit.</p>
<p>With Hdt.'s total of 378 (or 380) for
the Greek navy at Salamis is to be
compared Aischylos' 300 (<bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 339"><title>Pers.</title> 339</bibl>),
Thucydides' 400 (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.74.1">1. 74. 1</bibl>), Demosthenes'
300 (<foreign rend="ital">de cor.</foreign> 238). If Demosthenes did
not find this figure in his copy of
Thucydides (Stahl; “ex aliquot deterioribus,”
Hude) the two historians virtually
agree as against the poet and the orator.
Ktesias (ed. Gilmore, § 57), from the
Persian point of view, makes it 700 (of
which apparently only 110 are Athenian).
Tzetzes' 271 (<foreign rend="ital">ad Lycoph.</foreign> 1432) is surely
only a confusion with the numbers given
by Hdt. for Artemision.</p>
<p>The phrase repeated <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n *salami=ni

compiled not from documents drawn up

six Peloponnesian cities were each represented

others are anonymous. The Athenians,
Aiginetans, and Megarians may have
each been represented by one and only
one voice. Ambrakia and Leukas probably
were represented by Korinth; the

is obscure. The Council may not have

the sequel the only <foreign rend="ital">dramatis personae</foreign>
are Eurybiades, Adeimantos, Themistokles;
the rest are mutes—unless we

should perhaps be regarded as

it is evident that Eurybiades, in virtue
of the Spartan <title>Hegemonia</title> and his own

he puts the question to the vote, it is

narrative of the advance of the Persian
army, from <foreign rend="ital">c.</foreign> 39, or even from c. 34 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
There was perhaps a concentration of
the Persians in W. Boiotia (Koroneia?)
—to which point the centre would have
advanced by Parapotamioi and Chaironeia,
the left wing, from Abai, by Aspledon
and Orchomenos, the right wing, by Lilaia
— Delphi — Panopeus—Chaironeia, or
possibly even by Trachis—Amphissa—
Delphi—Lebadeia.</p>
<p><title>Thespiai</title> and <title>Plataiai</title> may have been
destroyed by an advance of the column
from Delphi; or by an excursion from
Thebes, where no doubt the Persian
force was concentrated: the Plataians
serving on the fleet had reached home
<pb n="436"/>
iu time to take part in the flitting to
Peloponnesos; cp. c. 44 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p>Hdt. evideutly thinks that the whole
land-forces of Xerxes entered Attica by
one and the same road; cp. c. 113 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>
This suppositiou is absurd. From Thebes
iuto Attica three routes would have
beeu available. I. Right, or west, by
Eleutherai—Eleusis (detaching a force
against Plataiai?): probably the best
and easiest route, theu as now. II. Ceutral,
by Pauakton—Phyle—Acharnai:
the most direct, and also the most
difficult. III. Left, or east, by Tauagra
and Dekeleia (cp. 9. 15 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), a cousiderable
circuit, but a good and much
frequented road. Probably the Persians
used all three, both goiug and coming;
doubtless also a cousiderable force was
left behind iu Boiotia, and garrisons all
along the kiug's route to the rear. The

the passage of the Hellespont is a mere
episode on the march from Sardes iu 480
B.C., aud the start is made from Sardes
with great pomp and circumstance (7.
37-40). Agaiu, in Bk. 7. 56 the passage
of the Hellespont occupies seveu days
and seven nights, just a week of our
reckoniug: here, a month is spent in
passing the Hellespont (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e(/na au)tou= diatri/yantes
mh=na e)n tw=| die/bainon e)s th\n
*eu)rw/phn</lem></app>). It might be possible to
‘harmonize’ the two statements by supposing
that the mouth covers all the
time spent on the Hellespout; but such
a harmouy is not convincing. The
month might as well cover all the period
from the start at Sardis: and in any
case the discrepancy remains, aud
suggests a difference of source. The
passages in Bk. 7 are probably from
Asianic sources. The passage before us
here is hardly less obviously from the
Europeau side, and presumably from
Attic authority, as the Archoutate
suggests. It is important to recognize
the <foreign rend="ital">insouciance</foreign> with which Hdt. writes
down in different contexts different data
from different sources, without troubling
himself to rationalize them; cp. Introduction,
§ 10. This acceptauce of the
local source for all it may be worth is of
the essence of Hdt.'s method, or unmethod;
it is half the secret of his
charm, and the chief cause of his value;
the unity of his work is a literary, a
poetic illusion, uot a scientific miracle.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="4">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n trisi\ e(te/roisi mhsi/</lem></app>. The meaning
is not so self-evideut as might be
wished. How are the ‘months’ computed?
By the calendar? Or purely by
the interval between start and arrival?
Are we to understaud that just uinety
days, or rather less, separated Sestos and
Athens on the Persian march? Or
are the months three months of the
Attic caleudar, Skirophorion, Hekatombaion,
Metageitnion, for example?
In either case the three months seems
an underestimate. The battle of Salamis
was fought about the 20th of
Boedromiou (cp. c. 65 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), and surely
within a mouth of the arrival of the
Persians iu Atheus. The fighting at
Artemision-Thermopylai approximately
synchronized with the Olympiad (7. 206
<foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> but cp. c. 26 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), i.e. could
not at the earliest have fallen before the
Attic uew year, which suits the date for
<pb n="437"/>
Salamis and the Archontate. But to
snppose that the battle of Salamis took
place only ninety days or so after the
passage of the Hellespont ascribes extraordinary
activity to the Persian advance.
Moreover, the start from Sardes will
probably have taken place at latest in
Elaphebolion (say March), and the
passage of the Hellespont in Thargelion
(say May). Taking the months here as
Attic months, and reckoning exclusively,
it might be correct to say that Xerxes
reached Athens three months after
leaving the Hellespont, i.e. in the fifth
month, reckoning inclusively.</p>
<p>There is an exactly parallel case in
Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 1. 4. 21, where Alkibiades
is said to have qnitted Athens <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/tw| mhni\
meta\ to\n kata/ploun</foreign> (407 B.C.). He had
landed on Thargelion 25 (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> § 12); he
left after Boedromion 20 (§ 20). This
would be at least four months after,
reckoning simply from arrival to departure,
or in the fifth month, reckoning
by Attic months, <foreign rend="ital">nominatim,</foreign> or after a
clear three months' interval, reckoned
exclusively. The word <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(te/roisi</foreign> here
might favour this last method (But
does <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/tw| mhni/</foreign> in Xenophon perhaps =
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*bohdromiw=ni</foreign>?) See further on the
chronology Appendix IV. § 2.</p></div>

Bnt as there were twelve months in the
year (and sometimes thirteen) this
chronological indication, though highly
acceptable on many grounds, leaves a
good deal to be wished: if but the day
of Xerxes' coming had happened to
engrave itself npon the records! Probably

Hdt. does not distingnish between the

Erechtheus’; he speaks of the temple
in a way as both existing and not existing—for
it had jnst been burnt down—
even on the day after the burning. It

whether the House of Erechtheus had

Kekrops was on the showing of this

interpretation of the myth is the
historical, which sees in it a transfigured
reminiscence of a struggle between two
cults, and the different worshippers
of two deities, Athene - worshippers,
Poseidon - worshippers, in Attica, in
which case, further, the Poseidonians
can be no other than Ionians, and the

shifts the scene back to Salamis, as in
c. 50 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> but what of the time? The
message there is not <foreign rend="ital">prima facie</foreign> identical
with the message here; and an appreciable
interval of time might be held to
occur between the news of the Persians'
arrival in Athens and the news of the
destruction of the Akropolis (cp. cc. 52,
53). But was it the news of the destruction
of the Akropolis, or only the news
of the blockade of the Akropolis, which
reached the Greek camp? Hdt. does
not here say clearly which. Would the
destruction of the Akropolis have required
to be reported? The conflagration
would have been fully visible from
Salamis. Whether reported or witnessed,
the capture of the Akropolis might form
a ground for reopening the question
whether the Greek fleet should remain
at Salamis or not. Perhaps the error in
Hdt. lies in his having recorded a debate
above, before the news of the Persian
arrival, or the evidence of the Persian
capture of the Akropolis, was conveyed
to Salamis. As long as the Akropolis
stood siege, there might be a hope that
the Peloponnesian army would advance
to its relief; and so long at least the
Greek fleet would of course remain at
Salamis. Once the Akropolis had been
captured, or surrendered, a new situation
did arise. The anecdote of Mnesiphilos
is transparently apocryphal; but the
notion that a debate on the next move
arose after the capture of the Akropolis
is not in itself so improbable.</p>

<p>The
speech here put into the mouth
<pb n="449"/>
of Themistokles is a brief and masterly
<foreign rend="ital">résumé</foreign> of the <foreign rend="ital">pros</foreign> and <foreign rend="ital">cons</foreign> of the case
between Salamis and the Isthmos as
the scene of the sea-fight, which (it is
admitted and agreed) must be fought
somewhere. The argument in the main
is presented in a series of six antithetical
considerations, which may be re-combined
into three antithetical or double-edged
assertions, followed by a peroration (iv.).</p>
<p>i The narrow water of Salamis is
in favour of the Greeks; the open sea
off the Isthmos would tell in favo&lt;*&gt;
the Persians.</p>
<p>ii. By moving to the Isthmos the&lt;*&gt;
will certainly lose Megara, Aigina,
Salamis; by remaining where they are
they will probably save them.</p>
<p>iii. They will defend the Peloponnesos
as well, or even better, by remaining at
Salamis; a defeat at the Isthmos will
be final. The reasons for this last assertion
are not quite fully given in the
speech; only it is suggested that the
Persian fleet and Persian army will be
brought unduly near to the Peloponnesos,
in which case a defeat would be very
serious, Mnesiphilos above, and Themistokles
himself, has taken the still more
alarming view that if they once quit
Salamis no battle will be fought at all.</p>
<p>iv. Finally, Themistokles adds that a
divine promise of victory has been received,
though they must not expect it
to be fulfilled if they deliberately choose
the less prudent alternative.</p></div></div>

he) offering us his advice.’</p>
<p>There seems to be no sufficient reason
for abandoning (with Stein) the normal
meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piyhfi/zein</foreign> so as to make it
mean ‘to allow a vote to’—an interpretation
which leads him to take
<foreign xml:lang="greek">gnw/mas sumba/llesqai</foreign> in the sense ‘mitzustimmen,’
i.e. to vote with (us). In
5. 92 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">gnw/mas a)mei/nonas sumbale/sqai h)/
per nu=n</foreign>) the meaning is clearly ‘to
advise.’ Against the normal interpretation
Stein asks: <title>Warum sollte der
Antrag eines heimatlosen Mannes nicht
Gegenstand einer Abstimmung sein
durfen?</title> The point of the story as told
by Hdt. appears to be that Adeimantos
wishes to find some pretext on which to
prevent the question being reopened.
He objects to Themistokles, who is now
a landless man, being allowed to propose
a motion or an amendment, as subject
for a vote in the council of war:
he takes exception to a man, who no
longer represents a state, having any
opinion or proposal submitted to a vote.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a radical flaw or
inconsequence in the narrative of Hdt.
in that, on the one hand, it implies
that the question of remaining or going
was to be decided by the votes of the
majority, while, on the other hand, it
no less clearly implies that the whole
and sole decision rested with Eurybiades.
But this inconsequence leaves the meaning
of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)piyhfi/zein</foreign> unaffected.</p>
<p>Stein quotes two late writers in
support of his interpretation. Lucian

formula that ‘so long as they have 200

the explanation that ‘no Hellenes whom

Nothing further is heard of the threat
in this sense; and it spoils the beautiful
crescendo of Themistokles' arguments,
being the most direct and brutal, if that
indeed was what he meant. He probably
meant something quite different: ‘Stone
walls do not a <foreign rend="ital">city</foreign> make.’ The seholiast

far beyond most Greeks of the fifth cent.
B.C., attained the eonception of the ideal
and spiritual character of the City,
and its independence of the particular
place and material conditions. Their
invention of the <foreign rend="ital">kleruchy,</foreign> in anticipation
of the Roman <foreign rend="ital">colonia civium opt. iur.,</foreign> is
an evidence of that. A great stage in
their education was doubtless the evacuation
of Attica in 480 B.C., and it bore
fruit sixty-eight years later, when in
412 B.C. the Athenian naval <foreign xml:lang="greek">strato/pedon</foreign>
at Samos preserved the continuity of
the Athenian Constitution, and formulated
the conception of a polity virtually
independent of place: <bibl n="Thuc. 8.76">Thucyd. 8. 76</bibl>.

Herakleia (Strabo 264); it was in the
neighbourhood of this river that Pyrrhus
fought his first engagement with the
Romans 280 B.C., Plutarch <title>Pyrrh.</title> 16.</p>
<p>The foundation legend is given by
Strabo, <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> Siris, originally a settlement
of the Chonians (i.e. native Italians
of that region, but cp. 9. 93 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), was
occupied by fugitive Trojans after the
fall of Troy (hence the worship of the
winking Athene in the city, Strabo <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>).
At a later time Ionians flying from
the Lydian conqueror (temp. Gygis?)
occupied the town. The Ionians were
apparently from Kolophon, and under
them the Ionian city, in the midst
of Achaian neighbours, rose to great
prosperity, and rivalled Sybaris and
Kroton in wealth and luxury. (Athen.

that the Achaian colonies, Metapontion,

Siris (Trogus Pomp. <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Justin. 20. 2.
3 ff.), and apparently accomplished their
purpose, notwithstanding the alliance of
the Sirites with Lokroi. Siris must have
continued to be inhabited, as ‘a member
of the Achaian confederacy’ (B. Head,
<title>Historia Numorum,</title> p. 69), and stood in
intimate commercial relation with the
town of Pyxos, a town on the Tyrrhene
sea, probably of Sybarite foundation,
and afterwards, perhaps, involved with
Siris in the ruin of that city 510 B.C.—
a catastrophe not inconsistent with the
dim record of a projected occupation of
Sirite territory by Samian adventurers
(cp. 7. 164 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), which may have
been an anticipation of the Athenian
project: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*sa/mioi, pleu/santes ei)s *su/barin

The dream of an Ionian restoration at
Siris was part of the heritage which
Athens accepted in placing, or replacing,
herself at the head of the Ionian race,
after the fall of Miletos; but there
shows no definite trace of an earlier
connexion between Siris and Athens.
The dream was not destined to be fulfilled.
Thurioi was, indeed, founded in
443 B.C., but at a considerable distance
from the Siris (330 stades, Strabo <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>),
nor was Thurioi a successful settlement
from an Athenian point of view (cp.
Busolt, <title>Gr. G.</title> III. i. 518-541). Somewhat
later, however (in 431 B.C.),
Tarentum succeeded where Athens had

<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta\ lo/gia le/gei ktl.</lem></app>: the formula
is noticeable, as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gia</foreign> in question
were no doubt in writing. This passage
may fairly be taken as evidence of the
antiquity of the idea at Athens of an
extension or colonization in the West.
To see in the speech of Themistokles,
more or less fictitious though it be,
nothing but the reflexion of ideas and
discussions current in Athens about the
date of the foundation of Thurioi is to
ignore the points above adduced as antecedents
of that very undertaking itself
There is also other sufficient evidence
to connect the name of Themistokles
with the conception of an expansive
policy in the West; cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.136.1">Thucyd. 1. 136.
1</bibl>, Plutarch <title>Themist.</title> 32 (names of his
daughters, Italia, Sybaris). Busolt's
defence of the claim of Themistokles in
this connexion against the adverse
critique of Beloch, <title>Hermes</title> 29 (1894), 604,
concedes perhaps too much in sacrificing
the antiquity of these <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gia</foreign> and seeing
in them mere products of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*qourioma/nteis</foreign>.
Athens had long been nursing
commercial relations with the West
(as Busolt well shows), and, moreover,
Themistokles and the Athenians would
probably have claimed as their own
<foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gia</foreign> which in the first instance might
have been intended to promote relations
between the Ionians and the West (cp. 1.
94, 163-167, 170, 3. 136-138, 4. 152, 5.
(42-47), 106, 6. 2, 21, 23-24, 7. 158, 163,
8. 22). Themistokles, if any man, was
likely to have taken into account the
Ionian precedents in the West. Whether
he used any such threat upon this
occasion, as is here fathered on him by
Hdt., is another question. It would
not have been easy to carry out, and
the threat of joining the Mede would
have been still more efficacious (cp. 9.
11). But the anecdote implies that
Eurybiades and the Peloponnesians were
on the point of withdrawing from
Salamis, and this implication is hardly
acceptable; cp. Appendix VI. § 1.</p></div></div>

21. 189</bibl> etc., but in Homer Aiakos is not
yet descended into hell, as Judge of the
Underworld). The best known sons of
Aiakos are Peleus, the father of Achilles,
and Telamon the father of Aias. From
Aias were further descended the Philaidai,
and Eurysakidai—two great Attic
clans—through their eponyms, his sons,
Philaios, Eurysakes. But Aiakos had
also a son Phokos (<bibl n="Paus. 2.29.7">Pausanias 2. 29. 7</bibl>),
whose tomb was shown in Aigina, where
he had been slain by his half-brother
Telamon, who was in consequence
banished the island. Hence the Greeks,
or Athenians, could invoke Telamon
and Aias in Salamis (where they had
resided), but had to send to Aigina
itself to invoke, or to fetch, Aiakos and
the other Aiakidai. But what others?
For Peleus and for Achilles they would
surely have had to send to their tombs
in Thessaly (?), in the Troad (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.80"><title>Od.</title> 24. 80</bibl>
ff.; Arrian, <title>Anab.</title> 1. 11. 12; cp. 5.

too, were to be sought in ‘Phokis,’
Pausau. 2. 29. 2. (It seems as if Aiakos

be found in Aigina.) In view of the
story in 5. 80, 81 it may fairly be argued
that this ship was sent to fetch actual
idols (<foreign xml:lang="greek">co/ana</foreign>), and not merely to perform
an invocation <foreign rend="ital">in loco;</foreign> cp. my notes to

<p>The names ‘Dikaios’ and ‘Theokydes’

‘Thucydides’ implies ‘Thucydes’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*qeoqou-ku/dhs</foreign>),
and, if fancy is to be the
order of the day, one might speculate
upon a possible connexion between the
father of Dikaios and the son of Oloros.
What was the name of the father of
Oloros, or Orolos? Considering the
Thracian connexions of Thucydides,
noting the extremely ‘superior’ manner
in which he disposes of medism and the
Median question, marking his tolerance
of the Peisistratidar and the Tyrannis at
Athens, one might amuse an idle halfhour
in elaborating the conjecture that
here, in this record of the unpatriotic
iôle played by a more or less distant
relative of his own, the Athenian historian
and exile scented a provocation
to the depreciatory estimate, both of
the subject selected and the methods

more catholic recognition, but the exact

<p>Six days are here accounted for,

second of which the naval forees were
occupied in getting back to Histiaia,
while the land-forces were getting under
way on their march through Phokis and
Boiotia to Athens. The previous day
had been devoted to sight-seeing at
Thermopylai; the day before that the
king's fleet was occupied in advancing
from Aphetai to Histiaia (c. 23 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)
Thus nine days in all are accounted for.
The first of these nine days is the day
immediately succeeding the fighting off
Artemision, which occupies three days,
exactly synchronizing <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> with
the engagements at Thermopylai: adding
these three days it would appear
that the Persian fleet arrived at Phaleron
on the twelfth day after its arrival at
Aphetai, both events included. The
fleet apparently finds the army in full
possession of Athens, but what interval
separated the arrival of army and of
fleet Hdt. does not specify. If Xerxes
occupied the Atheman Akropolis in less
than a week after leaving Thermopylai,
having in the meantime ravaged at least
Phokis, and destroyed Plataiai and
Thespiai, his advance was a tolerably
rapid one. In fact, it is hardly credible.
The log of the fleet may have been accurately
preserved; but the arrival of
fleet and army in Attica may have
synchronized, the apparent interval
being an illusion due to Hdt.'s method
in separating the accounts of synchronous
operations, and completing (relatively)
the story of one series before entering
on that of the other. He himself is here
more concerned with the material mass
than with the temporal motions of the
forces. Cp. Appendix VI. § 2.</p></div>

The judgement or calculation thus introduced
by the historian and claimed as
his own is not to his credit, being flatly
contradicted by his own previous narrative,
and in itself irrational. He judges
the forces of Xerxes by sea and by land
to have been as large, when they occupied
Attica, before the battle of Salamis,
as they had been at their arrival off
Sepias and at Thermopylai. It is not
quite clear, perhaps, whether Hdt.
means to exclude the losses in the storm
of&lt;*&gt; the Magnesian shore (as Blakesley
suggests); but even so, Blakesley finds
it impossible to conceive Hdt.'s statement
as “at all near the truth, unless
enormous exaggeiation is to be presumed
in the accounts of the engagements off
Artemision.” But the more natural interpretation
of this passage would refer
it back to 7. 183  <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> where the barbarians
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)canu/ousi th=s *magnhsi/hs xw/rhs
e)pi\ *shpia/da</foreign>—a statement at once followed
by the grossly exaggerated estimate of
the king's forces (7. 184-7), which is in
itself one of the greatest stumbling-blocks
in Hdt.'s historiography. His record of
the Persian losses at sea since that point
amount to upwards of 700 trinemes: of
his original total 1327, only about 600
remain at this point, according to the
narrative, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)cio/maxoi</foreign>. The notion that
these enormous losses could have been
made good by additions to the fleet
between Artemision and Phaleron is
patently absurd. The alternative presents
itself: that the losses, and that
the original numbers themselves, have
been greatly exaggerated. But the
navy-list, though not free from miscalculation,
is perhaps approximately
sound (cp. Appendix II. § 5). Hdt.'s
purpose is obvious, to identify the navylist
for Salamis with the estimate and
lists already given, and so to glorify the
victory. He may have been encouraged
by the fact that Aischylos had given,
virtually, the maximum for Salamis.
Hdt. not merely asserts that all losses
had been made good, but also assumes
that the whole fleet came to Phaleron.
Probably on neither point is he correct.</p>
<p>The case of the army is not identical
with that of the fleet. Losses had been
lighter, and the supplements far greater.
The Hellenic troops in the army of
Mardonios are estimated at 50,000 (9.
32 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). But Hdt. apparently makes
no allowance, in the case of army or of
fleet, for any guards or garrisons left <foreign rend="ital">en
route,</foreign> or for the ordinary wear and tear
of warfare. He assumes that the whole
land-forces of the king invaded Attica:
that assumption, if true, would render
more than ever incredible the gross
exaggeration of his estimates, 7. 184 ff.</p>
<p>In any case the deliberate calculation
of Hdt. in this passage, as in 7. 184 ff.,
shows that he takes himself seriously as
a historian, precludes our treating him
merely as an irresponsible <foreign rend="ital">raconteur,</foreign>
and goes far to justify the rigid application
of <title>Sachkritik</title> to his methods and

Artemisia too is credited
with the idea previously ascribed to
Demaratos, 7. 235 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> of an advance
on the Peloponnesos, but with a difference:
she appears to advocate a weak
blockade of Salamis and an advance by
the army (cp. below, <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(\n su\ e)pi\ th\n *pelopo/nnhson
e)lau/nh|s to\n pezo\n strato/n</foreign>).
Such an advance, she argues, will dissipate
and seatter the Hellenes—apparently
that is the Hellenic fleet at Salamis,
who are to be allowed and encouraged
to break up <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ po/lis</foreign>. They must be
looking for a <foreign xml:lang="greek">naumaxi/h</foreign>, as shortage of

Artemisia underrates the defensibility of
the Isthmos, which, apart from naval cooperation,
the Greeks could have held for

of the master, of the system. Still more

that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/ploos</foreign> was not accomplished:
it was for <foreign xml:lang="greek">naumaxi/hn poih/sasqai</foreign> that
daylight failed. The exaet position,
however, occupied by the fleet, when
this <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/ploos</foreign> was carried out completely,
is not clearly defined by the woids <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
th\n *salami=na</foreign>. Leake, followed by Grote,
argued that the movement here described
took the Persian ships right into the
straits, and ended in their being drawn
up in battle-array along the Attic shore,
facing the Greeks in the bay of Salamis.
That argument is in so far justified as
it gives point to the statement imme
diately sueceeding, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/te me/n nun . .
na maxihn poih/sasqai</foreign>, for this statement
seems to imply that the Persians have
reached a position in which they have it
&lt;*&gt; their power to deliver an attack.
Possibly Hdt. so conceived the situation
(as far as he had any clear and distinet
coneeption in the matter), but
nevertheless Leake's theory cannot be
correct or true to the facts. For
reasons given elsewhere (cp. Appendix
VI. § 3) it is incredible that the Persian
fleet entered the straits by daylight and
took up a position in order of battle
opposite the Greeks in the bay of
Salamis. Nor do the words of Hdt. in
this passage, which no doubt reproduce
what he had heard or read, of necessity
imply any such absurdity. The Persian
ships moved from Phaleron upon Salamis
to attaek the Greeks, and reaehed a
position in battle-array; but whether
that position was within or outside the
straits is not expressly stated, nor is

<pb n="465"/>
&lt;*&gt;s orientation given. As the Persians
were allowed to carry out this manœuvre
without being disturbed, the inference
would rather be that, as far as the
movement went this day, it was all
outside the straits.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="2">

On the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/tacis</foreign> ep. 7. 34, 124, 178. In
9. 98 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> we have <foreign xml:lang="greek">pollo\n de\ pezo\n
parakekrime/non para\ to\n ai)gialo/n</foreign>. The
foot-soldiers are necessarily on land, but
drawn up along-shore. In the present
instance <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ to\n ai)gialo/n</foreign> is wanting;
and even if it were supplied, the question
would arise, what or which shore? The
only indication of direction in this
passage is in the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ th\n *salami=na</foreign>
—the <foreign xml:lang="greek">para/tacis</foreign> (so to speak) is <foreign rend="ital">prima
facie</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ th\n *salami=na</foreign>, or secondly
<foreign xml:lang="greek">par/ a)llh/lous</foreign>—simply in parallel lines,
the whole position being indefinite, but
presumably outside the straits. If
‘Salamis’ with the article in Hdt.
always denoted ‘the town’ as distinct
from ‘the island,’ this passage would,
indeed, carry them inside the straits;
but no such canon obtains.</p>
<p>It is, however, quite possible that
Hdt. has gone too far in reporting for
this precise point the occupation of
a position, wherever it was, by the
Persian fleet, in battle - array; the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/ploos</foreign> may have begun, but <foreign xml:lang="greek">parekri/qhsan
diataxqe/ntes</foreign> may be incorrect
and premature. Or, again, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/tacis</foreign>,
too, may have been complete, and the
reason why no battle ensued may be,
not that night descended on the Persians,
but that the Greek fleet remained
ensconced in the bay of Salamis, and
would not respond to the challenge, or
come out to do battle with the king's
fleet in the open waters.</p>
<p>The precise day upon which the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/ploos</foreign> took place and battle was
offered, but not accepted, by the Greeks,
is clearly the day before the actual
battle, and as such would apparently
coincide with the day in cc. 64, 65 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign>
of the earthquake by sea and land, and
the vision of Dikaios and Demaratos.

possibility of their standing a siege in
the island, for lack of provision. There
is no similar suggestion here. She,

movement of the army must surely
stand in some relation to the movement

From Eleusis to the Isthmos was some
thirty miles. Was some movement of
the land-forces, designed to enable them
to co-operate with the fleet in the
impending battle, misinterpreted as an
advance on the Peloponnese? Or is the
march quite surely timed? Is it certain
that it took place just on this day, and
at nightfall? There is a considerable
margin of possible error in this assertion.

This is plainly a meeting of the
Strategoi (cp. c. 78 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), and it would
be at least the third recorded in Hdt.
(cp. cc. 49-56, 59-64 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). It is
apparently being holden at night—like
the previous one!—and the night would
be Boëdromiou 20 (by Attic reckoning;
cp. c. 65. 19), on which the Persian army
was reported or believed to be moving
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ th\n *pelopo/nnhson</foreign>, c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> while
the Persian fleet had been manœuvring
all, or most of the day previous, with a
view to bringing about a battle: <foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>
These manœuvres, these movements, may
well have given rise to fresh debate
among the Greek Strategoi. The question
would be, whether to assume the
offensive, or to await attack; and if the
offensive was to be assumed (as at
Artemision, cp. c. 9 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), at what
particular point: were the Greeks to
advance right out of the straits—as the
Persians appeared to desire—and to
encounter the king's fleet in comparatively
open water? Or were they to
allow, or to induee, the Persian admirals
to enter the narrow waters, and to
expose themselves, in entering, to a
flank attack?</p>
<p>It is possible that the Peloponnesians
were prepared to go out into the open
waters: the move to the Isthmos, the
selection of the open water there as the
scene of the engagement which (all
agreed) had to be fought somewhere,
might almost justify the suspicion that
the Peloponnesians were now advocating
an advance against the Persian fleet in
the open waters to the S. of Salamis.
But such an hypothesis were rash. To
fight in the open water off the Isthmos,
the bay of Kenchreai, with the Peloponnesos
immediately in the rear to fall
back upou, is one thing; but in the
open water off Salamis, another. The
risk of being shut up and besieged in
Salamis was, indeed, not in that case
inevitable; they might make good their
escape, if needs were, to the Peloponnese;
but still, with difficulty, and not without
risk of being surrounded and cut off,
which would not he possible, in the bay
of Kenchreai.</p>
<p>To fight at Salamis, and in the narrow
waters between Salamis and the Attic
shore, was clearly the plan of Themistokles.
But to procure the realization
of this plan, the Persian fleet should
enter the straits; and it had not yet
done so (cp. c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). His problem
was to bring that movement about.
The Persiaus presumably wished to fight
in the open waters off Salamis: some of
the Peloponnesians perhaps preferred to
fight in the less open, but also less confined,
waters of the bay of Keuchreai.</p>
<p>But the plan of Themistokles had
been already endorsed and adopted.
The movement of the Persian army
towards the Peloponnese (if it really
was moving thitherwards) could not
affect that plan. What did affect it
was the clear perception that the Persian
admirals had apparently no intention of
entering the straits: how, indeed, could
they venture to do so, with the Greek
fleet drawn up in the bay of Salamis,
ready to charge them in flank? A
debate might very well arise among the
Greek Strategoi as to the means of
inducing the Persian fleet to enter the
channel. Such a debate once started,
the previous question may possibly have
been raised again, as to whether the
Greek fleet had not better make for the
Isthmos. A battle had to be fought
somewhere. If the Persians would not
fight in closed waters, the battle must
<pb n="475"/>
be fought in the open. The bay of
Kenchreai was clearly more favourable to
the Greek chances than the open waters
off Salamis. The ruse of Themistokles,
presently related, undoubtedly led to the
battle in the straits; but it is extremely
difficult to believe that in effectuating
that ruse he acted without the knowledge
and connivance of his colleagues
(see below); it is, therefore, difficult to
believe that at this stage at least the
question of retreating to the Isthmos
was again seriously debated. The real
problem before the council was to devise,
or to accept, a plan by which the
Persians might be induced at dawn of
day to be entering the straits. The
plan devised, employed, perhaps expounded,
by Themistokles was a bold
one, not to be accepted without discussion.</p>
<p>The
notion that Themistokles could
slip unobserved out of the <title>Synedrion,</title>
the debate still continuing without him,
make his elaborate arrangements, remain
outside for hours, until Aristeides
arrives to report that the ruse is successful,
the Persian fleet already fully
surrounding the island, and then reenter
the council—still sitting—with
the startling news, is simply absurd.
Moreover, the reception of the news
seems to show that the Greek admirals
are not taken by surprise. The story,
as told by Aischylos, lends absolutely
no support to the tradition that the
plan of Themistokles was devised as
much against the Greeks themselves,
his colleagues, as against the Persians,
their enemies.</p></div>

admirals. (iii.) In Aischylos the message
leads the king to resolve on action, to
wit, the advance of the fleet: with Hdt.
the king has previously resolved to do
or to offer battle. This difference is
more apparent than real, as in each case
the Persian fleet advances to pursue the
Greeks supposed to be in flight—but the
effect of the difference is to make the
message perhaps even more prominent in
Aischylos than in Hdt. (iv.) Far more
important, with Aischylos the message
in no way compromises the sender or
the messenger, and there is nothing to
show or to suggest that it was despatched
with other than the full knowledge and
approbation of the anthorities on the
Greek side: with Hdt. and the main
tradition after his time the message is
designed to ontwit the Greeks no less
than the Persians, nay, rather, to force
the hand of the Greeks in the first
instance, and compel them, against
their will, to do battle at Salamis. (v.)
As a further difference, the message in
Aischylos reports simply a projected
flight of the Greeks: the message in
Hdt. proclaims the ‘medism’ of the
sender, and of a great part of the fleet</p>
<p>The ‘flight’ <foreign rend="ital">motif</foreign> and the ‘medism’
<foreign rend="ital">motif</foreign> might be alternatives, combined
in the message as given by Hdt. The
flight of the Greeks means that they
are not going to do battle, but to escape,
and that under cover of night The
message as given by Aiscliylos is
thoroughly consistent with itself, and
with the time and circumstances of its
despatch. The message as given by
Hdt. reports instant flight (in the night),
but also promises medism if the flight
is stayed and a battle forced on.
Possibly the ‘medism’ has been projected
baek into this message from the
later career of Themistokles.</p>

you cannot fight a flying enemy—but on
pursuit, on a forward movement, which
would bring a portion at least of the
Persian fleet within the straits. As the
Greek fleet by that time would be well
under way, the Persians might be
expected to overhaul it, and come upon
its rear in the bay of Eleusis, or in the
narrower waters beyond. As the (fresh?)
plan or disposition of the Persian
admirals certainly included the stopping
of the narrow channel between Salamis

to find the Greek fleet thrown into
utter confusion when they came upon
it by the Eleusis channel.</p>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou=to me/n</lem></app>: their first act, on
being convinced of the projected flight
of the Greeks, was to land a large force
of Persians on the island of Psyttaleia.
Down below the motive of this action
is elaborately explained: the island lay
in the thoroughfare, or waterway, of the
coming battle, and the men upon it
would be useful in dealing with wrecks
and men, whether friends or foes.</p>
<p>This motivation is obviously a complete
misconception, if the island
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*yutta/leia</foreign> is correctly identified with the
island bearing the lighthouse between
Peiraieus and Salamis to-day (<title>Leipsokoutali</title>)—one
Engl. mile long and from 200
to 300 yards broad: Strabo 395, and the
moderns, e.g. Leake—for an island in
that position could have no bearing on
the operation of the Persians now in
hand. Even if they were expecting a
battle at all, it was surely to take plaee
far to the west of this position: unless
indeed they assumed that the Greeks
would be driven back and out of the
straits eastwards by the ships sent
round the island to the Megarid channel.
Possibly, however, Hdt. has simply mistimed
the occupation of Psyttaleia. If
it was the first move of the Persians,
then it had been made probably on the
previous day, in connexion with the
manœuvres recorded in c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
If it was not made during the day of the
19th Boedromion, then it was probably
only made the next morning, after the
sea-fight had begun—where Aischylos
might be thought to place it, or admit
of its being placed.</p>
<p>In any case, the identification of
Psyttaleia is unfavourable to the theory
of Leake and Grote, according to which
the Persian fleet is supposed to be already
by this time inside the straits, and
drawn up, in battle-array, backed by the
Attic shore, and facing the bay of
Salamis. (If any island called for
occupation from that position—especially
in view of the message of Sikinnos—it
would rather be the island of <title>St. George,</title>
or of Leros?) It is difficult to see how
<title>Lipsokoutali</title> could be said to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n po/rw|
th=s naumaxi/hs th=s mellou/shs e)/sesqai</foreign>, if
both forces were inside the straits, and
the Persian based on the Attic shore.
This passage implies that the battle was
to be fought between two forces, one
attempting to get out of the straits, and
the other attempting to get in.</p></div>

This implication is consistent with c. 70

was the exact position of ‘the western

the fleet was in the position advocated
by Leake (<foreign rend="ital">vide supra</foreign>) the western wing
would be the right wing; if in a position
outside the straits (as appears to be here
implied in the immediate context, and
is alone consistent with Aischylos), then
the western wing might be, and probably
was, the left wing. On the former
hypothesis the movement here described
would have for its purpose the foreclosure
of the channel into the bay of Eleusis;
on the latter hypothesis (really the only
tenable one) the movement is one,
imperfectly and obseurely described
indeed, but apparently designed to
detach a part of the fleet in order to
cireumnavigate the island, and to bar
the western channel, between the island
and the Megarid. Such a movement
must, indeed, have been undertaken in
the course of the Persian manœuvres; to
have omitted it would have been a
cardinal blunder; it is actually recorded
by Diodoros (Ephoros) 11. 17. 2, perhaps

Baehr and Rawlinson are right against
others and Blakesley in refusing to
identify this Keos with the island, and
this Kynosura with the well - known
promontory by Marathon. Hdt. has
brought the whole Persian fleet to
Phaleron; and he (still more his sources)
would have hesitated to move a squadron
from Marathon to Munichia in half a
September night, even if the order for
moving could have been communicated.
Leake identified this Kynosura with the
long pointed promontory of Salamis
projecting due east, and narrowing the
chaunel between Salamis and Psyttaleia.
Keos he wished to place somewhere on
Salamis, or on the Attic coast opposite
Kynosura, or again proposed to read <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n
nh=son</foreign>, i.e. Psyttaleia, which last gives
good sense. But Stem more iugeniously
identifies Keos with Kynosura, a younger
and an elder name, ‘Kynosura’ being
also necessitated by the oracle quoted
below c. 77. The name of the island,
moreover, was not <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ke/os</foreign> but <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ke/ws</foreign>, hence
the inhabitants are <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kei=oi, *kh/ioi</foreign>; cp. cc

as due to Hdt.'s ignorance</p>
<p>But could <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( a)mfi\ th\n *ke/on</foreign>, so understood,
be ‘the eastern wing’? They
would be, or become so, at least when
the western wing had moved off to

that the topographical indication represents
rather the point of destination
than the point of departure. In any
case the terms <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)nh=gon me/n — a)nh=gon

of the fleet, but to a division and
separation into two wings, or squadrons,

a fresh tactical disposition.</p></div>

these words, especially the topographical
item, might seem some justification for
Grote's view that Keos and Kynosura
were places somewhere on the Attic
coast between Phaleron and Sunion.
But the phrase applies as much to the
clause <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nh=gon me\n to\ a)p' e(spe/rhs ke/ras</foreign> as
to the clause <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nh=gon de\ oi( a)mfi\ th\n *ke/on</foreign>:
in other words, it applies primarily to
neither, unless, indeed, Hdt. was ignorant
of the position of Munichia, here alone
mentioned in his work. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*mounixi/h</foreign> is
undoubtedly and notoriously (i.) the hill
above the Peiraieus, which formed the
citadel of the Athenian port; (ii.) one of
the three harbours under that hill, the
other two being the Peiraieus and Zea (?);
cp. E. A. Gardner, <title>Ancient Athens</title> (1902)

strait, or narrow waterway; cp. c. 91
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> The whole phrase here would
better apply to the situation and aspect
of the Persian fleet in the bay of
Phaleron than in the more open waters,
between Salamis (Keos) and Munichia;
yet it may be taken generally to describe
the position of the Persian fleet, extending
from the isle of Salamis across to
Mimichia (the hill, <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/fos</foreign>) before it
broke up into two squadrons, one of
which moved west, round the island, to
block the Megarian channel, while the
other closed up towards Keos, to block
the channel between Keos and Psyttaleia,

<p>This chapter has been challenged;
it is athetized by Krueger and by van
Herwerden: there are at least seven
arguments against its authenticity. (i.)
The matter is very abruptly introduced,
without any obvious justification in the
context. What has a defence of oracles
to do with the manœuvres of the Persian
fleet on the eve of the battle, or with
the diseussions of the Greek Strategoi?
(ii.) There is some doubt whether the
oracle cited originally referred to Salamis
at all; see detailed notes below. (iii.)
The language, not indeed of the oracle,
but of the writer, is peculiar, and
his style somewhat incoherent. Would
Hdt. not have expressed himself somewhat
differently? (iv.) We should hardly
expect to find Hdt. taking Bakis, rather
than Delphi, as his <foreign rend="ital">point d'appui</foreign> in his
Apologetic. (v.) The defence might
have been introduced more aptly iu c.
96 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> (vi.) The oraele is a <foreign rend="ital">vaticinium
post eventum.</foreign> (vii.) The passage is omitted
in <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">b.</lem></app> But these objections are inconclusive
both severally and cumulatively.
Thus (i.) Hdt. makes digressions, and
the description of the Persian fleet as
filling the whole ‘ferry’ or <title>Fahrweg</title>
might be excuse enough for intioducing
an oracle interpreted to refer to this
appearanee. (ii.) The correctness of the
reference is neither here nor there; it is
clear that the reference was actually
made; why not by Hdt. if by any one?
(iii.) Hdt. waxes incoherent at times,
especially when excited. (iv.) Bakis
and such seers would stand most in
need of defenee; many might impugn
Bakis, who would hesitate to challenge
Delphi. (v.) The reference in c. 96 piesupposes
this quotation. (vi.) Even if a
<foreign rend="ital">vatic. p. event.</foreign> like many other oracles,
there was time enough between the dates
of Salamis and of Hdt.'s composition for
the invention of the verses. (vii.) The
better class of MSS. have this chapter,
and the inferior omit not merely this
chapter, but a good deal besides; cp.
App. Crit. But this chapter is plainly
an insertion; ep. c. 78 <foreign rend="ital">ad init.</foreign></p>
<p>Stein, who admits the authenticity
of the chapter, seems to regard the
argument as a reply to the scepticism
current at the beginning of the Peloponnesian
war. If so, it would belong
to the third, or final draft of Hdt.'s
history. But the reference in c. 98 is
(I think) in favour of an earlier insertion,
and scepticism was not a novelty in 431
B.C. I should be inclined to regard this
chapter as belonging to the second draft,
aud as written after Hdt.'s first visit to
Athens. Cp. Introduction, § 9.</p>

What strand?</p>
<p>(1) Leake understood it of Salamis, or

west coast of the bay of <title>Ambelaki</title>: if
this were correct the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/fura</foreign> wonld seem
to be formed by the Hellenic ships; unless,
indeed, the referenee were to the
(projected) bridge of boats from Attica
to Salamis, e. 97 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> But the latter
interpretation would ill suit <foreign xml:lang="greek">*kuno/soura</foreign>.</p>
<p>(2) A more famous stiand of Artemis
was that by Brauron, on the east coast of
Attica. If that were the strand in view,
then Kynosura would naturally be the
best known promontory of the name
at Marathon; and the reference in the
oracle would rather be to the battle of
Marathon than to the battle of Salamis.
Blakesley, who identifies this Kynosura
with the Marathonian, would place the
Artemisian strand on the Euboian eoast,
near Eretria, where was a temple of
Artemis Amarusia, which might give a
better sense for <foreign xml:lang="greek">gefurw/swsi</foreign>.</p>
<p>(3) The most obvious identification is
to regard the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)arte/midos i(ero\s a/kth/</foreign> here
in question as the Attic shore near the
temple of Artemis Munichia (<cit><quote xml:lang="greek">*mounuxi/as

R Adam <foreign rend="ital">de Hdti. ratione historica</foreign>
(1890) p. 22, Goodwin, and others. The
bridging of the sea from Munichia to
Kynosura in this case, of course, would
simply mean the appearance presented
by the vast numbers of the Persian fleet,
which, extending in line (or rather in
three lines, cp. <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 366">Aisch. <title>Pers.</title> 366</bibl>) from
the Peiraieus to <title>Hagia Varvara,</title> might
be taken to present the appearance of
a bridge, or raft, covering the sea.</p>
<p>(4) It has been suggested (J. A. R.
Munro, <title>J.H.S.</title> xx. 1902, p. 306) that
the real reference in this oracle is to the
Artemision at the north end of Euboia,
which has already figured largely in
Hdt. Kynosura he refers to the Marathonian
promontory of that name, and
interprets the oraele as having originally
promised a victory to Hellas when her
enemies bridged with their ships the
channels at the north and south ends
of Euboia. But (1) if the reference had
been to the circumnavigation of Euboia,
Chalkis rather than Kynosura would
surely have marked the southern channel.
(2) Even if <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/tnia *ni/kh</foreign> could have been
predicated or predicted of the sea-fights
off North Euboia, (3) the reference to the
sack of Athens, <foreign xml:lang="greek">lipara\s pe/rsantes *)aqh/nas</foreign>,
as antecedent of the ‘bridging,’ points
clearly to Salamis, and shows that the

that the two passages are from different
sources, and perhaps belong to different
drafts. The anecdote which here follows
is part of the legend of Themistokles.
Lysimachos is a common Greek name;
upwards of twenty men are known to
have borne it. Of the father of Aristeides
nothing more is recorded, but he was
of course, like his son, of the tribe
Antiochis and of the deme Alopeke
(Plutarch <title>Aristeid.</title> 1); no doubt a
man of substance, and perhaps of the
Alkmaionid party. The ostrakism of
Aristeides had taken place in 483 B. C.
obviously to clear the way for the naval
law of Themistokles (ep. Appendix III.
§ 4), and he had been recalled with all
other exiles in 481 B C. Stein supposes
that the law of amnesty had only just
been passed, otherwise Aristeides would
have appeared sooner in the camp. But
is the texture of the Herodotean historiography
so close as to eonvince us that
this was the actual <foreign xml:lang="greek">ka/qodos</foreign> of Aristeides?
Far more probable is J. B. Bury's idea
(<title>Class. Rev.</title> x. 1896, 414 ff.), that
Aristeides was at this moment one of
the Athenian Strategoi duly elected in the
spring of 480 B. C., otherwise, indeed,
his exploit in c. 95 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> is hardly intelligible.
As such he would presumably
have been present at the Synedrion of
Strategoi, unless we are to suppose that
only one Strategos from each state was
present. If the anecdote here given is
anything more than a fable, Aristeides
must have been away on special service;
in which case a mission to Aigina
presents itself as the most plausible
hypothesis to account for his movements
That mission, if not to invoke the
Aiakidai, may have been for the purpose
of convoying Athenian refugees;
cp. c. 41 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></div>
<div type="commline" n="3">

This personal judgment is most significant.
In the controversy over the rival
merits of Themistokles and Aristeides,
Hdt. definitely takes sides with the
latter: of the moral superiority of
Aristeides he has no doubt; his mind
is absolutely made up once for all on
that question (hence the perfect tense).
Thucydides' celebiated defence of Themistokles
(1. 138) only affeets his intellectual
qualities, and his policy. The reputation
of Aristeides was based probably upon
four leading points, all subsequent to
his ostrakism and restoration: (i.) his
<title>Strategia</title> at Plataia; (ii.) his full acceptance
of the naval destiny of Athens;
(iii.) his great services in connexion with
the foundation of the maritime hegemony,
including the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/cis fo/rou</foreign>; (iv.)
his popular reforms of the Constitution.
But, above all, probably his personal
character, honesty, and honour contributed
to his apotheosis. See further,

this announcement referred simply to a
<foreign xml:lang="greek">periku/klwsis</foreign> by the Persian fleet inside
the straits (as in Leake's theory), the
Grecks themselves in Salamis would
scarcely have failed to perceive it, and
Aristeides' announcement would have
been stale news. Or again, if Aristeides
had merely meant that the Persians had
moved up and blocked the passages right
and left of Psyttaleia, that movement
would not have constitnted a <foreign xml:lang="greek">periku/klwsis</foreign>,
and a way of escape by the
Megarid channel would still have been
open to the Peloponnesians. Moreover,
on neither of these hypotheses is it
clear how Aristeides should have reached
Salamis. If the bay of <title>Ambelaki</title> was
blocked, he might have landed somewhere
on the sea-front of the island,
and made his way overland to the Greek
laager; but he would not have been
more an <foreign rend="ital">autoptes</foreign> than hosts of others.
If only the eastern ends of the straits
were blocked, he might have come in
by the west—but by the same chaunel
the Greeks might go out. The only
adequate meaning of the message is
that both ends, that by Psyttaleia or
Kynosura, and that by Megara-Budoron
(<bibl n="Thuc. 2.94.4">Thuc. 2. 94. 4</bibl>), are closed and held
by Persian ships. Probably every one
knew by this time that such was the
case with the eastern end; the news
Aristeides brings is that there is a
squadron blocking the western outlet.
Coming from Aigina he might have discovered
that by crossing the path of
that squadron on its way, or perhaps
by having to fly before it. How his
own ship reached Salamis is not specified;
but he may have come in by the
Budoron channel. If there were Persian
ships patrolling the coast of Salamis
towards the open sea, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">periku/klwsis</foreign>
would be still more effective; but it was
complete, as far as the argument requires,
by the closure of both outlets

Greek Strategoi, no less wakefully than
by the enemy. It must be the Strategoi
who are referred to in the demonstrative

<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> there comes a <foreign xml:lang="greek">su/llogos tw=n strathgw=n</foreign>
(Plutarch <title>Aristeid.</title> 8). The
assembly of <title>Epibatai</title> must have been
held on shore. The ships were in the
water, the rowers on board. The battle
was not to be so much a question of
manœuvring as of hand-to-hand fighting,
in the good old style: laying ships
alongside, and boarding!</p>
<p><foreign xml:lang="greek">su/llogon poihsa/menoi</foreign> cuts both ways.
There was a plurality of conveners, but
not necessarily of speakers. It is not
quite clear whether each Strategos
addressed his own <title>Epibatai,</title> or whether
Themistokles was the sole speaker, as
he is certainly the sole speaker reported.
The total number of <title>Epibatai</title> is a matte&lt;*&gt;
of conjecture or inference, and might
have varied with different contingents.
Plutarch,  <title>Themist.</title> 14, says that at
Salamis the number was 18 per ship: if
correct that estimate would give 6840 for
the 380 ships. Hdt. gives 30 men as the
number of <title>Epibatai</title> on the Persian sidc,
7. 184 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>—by no means a trustworthy
figure in itself for the whole fleet, much
less directly transferable to the Greek.
If so transferred, it would give a total of
11,400. At the battle of Lade, in 494
B.C., there had been 40 Epibatai on each
of the Clnan vessels (6. 15), a very large
allowance. During the Peloponnesian
war, a time when ships were themselves
the weapon of offence, and more was
done by manœuvring and ramming, the
normal complement was only 10 (Thuc.
2. 92, 102, 3. 91, 95, 4. 76, 101). It
would be fairly safe to say that at
Salamis there were from 7000 to 10,000
<title>Epibatai</title> on the Greek side.</p></div>

was no doubt a short speech, though
not so short as this brief summary, or
‘concept’ thereof; but the speaker was
evidently no mean orator. The speech
comprised three heads: (i.) A series of
antitheses, in which the better and the
worse, the noble and the base alternatives
in human nature, circumstances,
and also no doubt actions, were contrasted.
Hdt. characteristically fails to
distinguish clearly between action and
circumstance (cp. 7. 152 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). (ii.) An
appeal, or exhortation (<foreign xml:lang="greek">parai/nesis</foreign>) to his
hearers to choose the better part, liberty,
honour, death, rather than slavery, defeat,
the last and the tax-collector; and
doubtless to remember that they were
fighting under the eyes of their wives
and children. (iii.) The appeal merged
into a peroration (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kataple/cas th\n r(h=sin</foreign>),
in which no doubt the gods and heroes
were invoked, and Marathon, ‘the
trophies of Miltiades,’ even Artemision,
probably were not forgotten. The whole
speech left upon the hearers' minds the
sense of confidence, courage, ability,
intellectual force. One misses from the
brief report two points, which will
hardly have been absent in the actual
harangue: some estimate of the opponents
and their chances, and some hints
of the actual tactics to be pursued.</p></div>

the trireme brought the images.

advanced (or were advancing) their ships

complete (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)nagome/noisi de/ sfi</lem></app>), indeed
while it was little more than begun
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">au)ti/ka</lem></app>), they found themselves attacked
by the barbarians (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)peke/ato oi( b.</lem></app>). Our
whole conception of the actual engagement
must turn upon the true interpretation
of these words. They look simple
enough, but their meaning is obscure.
At first sight they might seem to lend
themselves to Leake's interpretation of
the movements recorded in cc. 70, 76
<foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> the Greek fleet advances out of
the bay of <title>Ambelaki,</title> and finds itself at
once involved, front to front, with the
king's fleet, which has also advanced to
attack. But if that were the situation,
the two fleets would have been in full
view of each other all along since the
first streak of dawn; and the element
of surprise, involved in these words, is
inexplicable. The Greeks are taken
<pb n="489"/>
aback: before their own movement is
complete they find the barbarians in
motion against them. Nothing of that
sort could have arisen on Leake's hypothesis.
Granted that Hdt. so conceived
the matter: but what sense is there in
saying of two fleets, moving upon each
other, front to front, that the one fleet
advanced to the attack, and, while it
was advancing, the other fleet attacked
it? Such a statement is only intelligible
on the supposition of a flank engagement.
If the Greek fleet was emerging from the
bay of <title>Ambelaki</title> just at the same moment
as the Persian fleet was entering the
straits, such a situation might arise:
either the Greek fleet might cut the
Persian column, somewhere behind its
leading ships, or the head of the Persian
column might strike the extreme right
of the Greek fleet <foreign rend="ital">en flanc.</foreign> If the
Persian column were two or three ships
abreast, or if there were two or more
Persian columns — the one column
perhaps pressing in between Psyttaleia
and the island of Salamis, the other
between Psyttaleia and the Attic mainland
—a more complicated situation
might easily arise: the extreme right of
the Greek wing might be taken <foreign rend="ital">en flanc,</foreign>
or involved with the left column of the
Persian advance, while the right Persian
column might have to advance much
further before becoming engaged with
the Greek left. If such was, indeed,
the whole situation adumbrated in this
chapter, it is possible that the engagement
opened, that actual contact with
the enemy was effected, sooner than
Themistokles intended or could have
wished: he must have desired a large
number of the Persian vessels to enter
the straits before the actual fighting
began.</p></div>

of Ameinias of Pallene was ill-advised
and premature. That the Greek right
wing backed water (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pru/mnhn a)nekrou/onto</lem></app>),

enough; the Greeks on the right were
much nearer the advancing enemy.
That they were actually for beaching

of popular (Attic) scandal, started by

undoubtedly this expression here squares
best with the projection of the battle
lines on Leake's plan. (If there were
not a good deal in the text of Hdt. to
suggest that plan it would never have
been heard of.) It is the eminent merit
of Professor W. W. Goodwin's paper,
<title>Papers Amer. Sch. Ath.</title> i. 1885, 239 ff.
(cp. Appendix VI. § 3) to have shown
that the (natural) identification of <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\

this place with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ a)p' e(spe/rhs ke/ras</foreign> in
c. 76 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> is not necessary, and on a
rational conception of the manœuvres of
the Persian fleet is, indeed, impossible.
It by no means follows that Hdt.
intended to distinguish them, or even
clearly and consciously faced the problem
of the identity or difference between
them. Hdt. reported each movement
in terms of his authorities, his sources,
he had perhaps written a preliminary
sketch or draft of the battle-piece before
he ever saw the landscape: at no time
did he compose an explicit, coherent, or
relatively complete account. It was
inevitable that Goodwin's suggestion
should be challenged and discarded, in
the forlorn hope of rehabilitating Hdt.
as a competent war-correspondent; see
‘Herodotus's Account of the Battle of
Salamis,’ by Pres. B. I. Wheeler in <title>Trans.
Am. Philol. Assoc.</title> xxxiii. 1902, 127 ff.
That kind of apology is hardly possible
for students of Hdt. who deal with the
work as a whole, and have realized the
relation of Hdt. to his sources and the
canons of his logography.</p>
<p>In strictest accuracy the wing, or
column, towards Eleusis could not be
the west wing: Eleusis is about dnc
<pb n="491"/>
north of ‘Old Salamis,’ and NNW. of
Psyttaleia. But in entering the straits
the Persian fleet would have been steering
almost due west, and Eleusis would
be ahead of it. The description is not
one which should be found fault with
under the circumstances: both its factors
may be strictly true, not in relation to
each other, but in relation to the
Phoenician ships that fine morning—
whether they were heading into the
straits, or lying with their sterns towards
the Attic coast off Mount <title>Skaramanga</title>
(Aigaleos) and their stems to the bay of
Salamis.</p>
<p>In either case the Athenians appear
to be on the Greek left. This was the
position which their hoplites occupied
afterwards in the battle of Plataia, and
the right wing was the natural place for
the hegemonic state, or commander, to
occupy (cp. ‘the <foreign rend="ital">prytaneia</foreign>’ of Miltiades,
and the position of the polemarch at
Marathon: 6. 110, 111). The tactics of
land-fighting were naturally transferred
to the naval war. At Artemision, however,
the Athenians had occupied
apparently the right. There the
Spartans wished to be in more immediate
touch with Leonidas: the right was
there also the post of danger; the Attic
ships at Chalkis might be regarded as
holding the extreme left (for the time
being). In their own waters it may
have been galling for the Athenians to
hold the left; but Themistokles might
gladly acquiesce in the inner station,
which made a retreat for the Peloponnesians
doubly difficult. It is,
indeed, conceivable that had the Pelopounesian
vessels at any time actually
attempted to fly past the Athenian
station, the barbarians might have
enjoyed the spectacle of the Greeks <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ pro\s th\n h)w= te kai\ to\n *peiraie/a</lem></app>.
Why Hdt. here substitutes the Peiraieus
(an <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/pac l.</foreign> in his work!) for Munichia
in c. 76 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> is an obscuie problem,
the solution of which might depend on
the complete disclosure of the mystery
of his sources. From the straits of
Salamis (as W. W. Goodwin <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> p. 252 n.
observes) “the harbour of Peiraieus and
all the lower land of the peninsula
almost disappears from view, and the
high hill of Munichia remains a most
conspicuous landmark.” The passage
here before us, then, may come from a
source, possibly even an ‘Ionian’ source,
which was not looking back from the
straits of Salamis, but was outside the
straits, on sea, or even on land, and
thought of Eleusis (quite invisible) and
Peiraieus naturally as lying west and
east.</p>
<p>If the conception above g&lt;*&gt; of the
manœuvres of the Persian fleet during
the night be correct, it will appear
probable that the Ionians in the first
instance occupied the centre of the
Persian lines—a position in which it
would perhaps have been more difficult
for them  <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)qelokake/ein</foreign>. When the
Persian position was developed, and
altered, the Egyptians on the left being
detached to circumnavigate the island
and to block the Megarian chanuel,
and the remainder moved up between
Psyttaleia and the island on the one
hand, the Attic shore on the other,
the Ionian contingent may have occupied
the left, or left centre of the Persian lines.
In the morning when the Phoenician
vessels entered the straits in column,
and the Ionians swung round to follow,
they would become the rear of the
advancing column, and might easily
extend back as far as the Peiraieus.
But ‘Peiraieus’ may be here used almost
as laxly in relation to actual orientation
as ‘Eleusis’ just above. It would,
however, be absolutely wrong and misleading
if the Persian fleet were still
drawn up in battle-array on the lines
from the Attic coast through Psyttaleia
to Keos-Kynosura; the left would then
have been furthest from Peiraieus, and
the right (i.e. the Phoenicians) furthest
from Eleusis. Of all modern theories
of the battle-lines at Salamis this one
is the most difficult to reconcile with
the authorities, Hdt. included, and with
common sense.</p></div>

(here <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n ne/a</foreign>) follows after”; or, as we
might say: <title>If a fresh subject intervene

Stein elsewhere suggests), the interposition
of the fresh Subject would
eclipse, or obscure, the direct relation
of the Reflexive pronoun; cp. 1. 111 <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(

to flight? Or did they suspect the

Such questions may seem to treat the

remarkable. The Athenian squadron
must have taken up more than half the
Greek lines of battle; the Aiginetans
may have been posted (or had some of
their ships posted) on the extreme left
of the Peloponnesian contingent, or
wing. The Athenian vessel may have
come out left of Psyttaleia, and the
Aiginetan on the right. The dramatic
transaction, which is probably historical,
should take place in the outer, not in the
inner waters: the notion that it occurred
under the very eyes of Xerxes is perhaps
for the sake of the moral, i.e. fabulous.</p>
<p>The Samothrakians are in this anecdote
regarded as Ionians: the primitive population
was Pelasgian, 2. 51; ‘Thrakian
Samos’ (Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.12"><title>Il.</title> 13. 12</bibl>) was very

is correct—and as early as 494 B.C.
the Ionians at least were supposed to be
competent in that manœuvre, cp. 6. 12,
15—the battle of Salamis was not simply a
land-fight on ‘wooden wall’ or ‘boarded’
field, but a true sea-fight, in which the

Xerxes did not order the Phoenicians to

During at least some part of the day
Xerxes may have been seated somewhere
on a throne, from which he could witness
the fight, “the principal officers of his
household standing around him, the
imperial parasol held by an attendant
over his head, and the scribes by his
side, writing down the names of those
who had distinguished themselves in the
action,” Leake, <title>Athens and the Demi,</title>
ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 270. From Mount Aigaleos you can
overlook the whole bay, and survey the
waters both within and beyond the
island of <title>Lipsokutali:</title> what a view!—
but hardly from a seat <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(po\ tw=| o)/rei</foreign>, ‘at
the foot of the mountain.’ If the seat
of Xerxes was down there, or even down
on the lower slopes, but little above the
shore, not much would have been seen
of the details of a battle, even all confined
to the straits and bay of Salamis
(<title>Ambelaki</title>).</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="18">
<p>The words <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ kale/etai *ai)ga/lews</lem></app>

making acquaintance with the scene.
To survey all the possible area of action,
to look down into the bay of Eleusis as
well as into the bay of Salamis, Xerxes
would have needed to ascend high on
Mt. <title>Skaramanga:</title> the matter afloat this
time was no mere parade, or procession,
as in 4. 88, 7. 44 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Neither was the
king bound to sit still in one spot all
the time! He will have ridden to the
foot of the ascent, and have moved up

by his <foreign rend="ital">aides-de-camp</foreign> and suite, as
the evolutions of the battle proceeded.

we should have heard how he sprang up
from his seat, thrice and three times
thrice, <foreign xml:lang="greek">dei/santa peri\ th=| stratih=|</foreign> (7. 212

to rule out the straits, as though <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/lagos</foreign>

but Aischylos is not anyway in strict

Plutarch. <title>Themist.</title> 13) placed the seat
of Xerxes <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pe\r to\ *(hra/kleion</foreign>—which may
be the source of <bibl n="Diod. 11.18.2">Diodoros 11. 18. 2</bibl>, so
far as the king's position is concerned
therein—but how far, how much above
the Herakleion? The Herakleion apparently
occupied the shore end of the
ferry, across the narrowest part of the
straits (cp. note to c. 97 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>).
Akestodoros (Plutarch <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) located the
king far to the west, beyond Eleusis,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n meqori/w| th=s *megari/dos u(pe\r tw=n kaloume/nwn
*kera/twn</foreign>. In that position he
would have seen nothing at all of
the actual battle described in Hdt.,
though he might have seen something
worth seeing (cp. c. 94 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). The
tradition in Akestodoros deserves, however,
less absolute contempt than it has
received: the very fact that it is so
remote from the apparent necessities of
the case should have obtained for it a
careful scrutiny. Considering that the
army, or a part of the army, had moved
in the night before the battle to the west
(c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); that on the day before
the battle Demaratos and Dikaios,
eminent members of the king's suite,
were on the Thriasian plain (c. 65
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); that a detachment of the
Persian fleet had been sent round
Salamis to block the Megarian channel
(c. 76 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); that the Greeks were
(perhaps) believed to be in full retreat
through the bay of Eleusis (c. 75 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>),
a position overlooking the Megarian
Sound might not have seemed ill-chosen
for a bird's-eye view of the coming
encounters. No one would have suggested
it as commanding the actual scene
of the battle of Salamis. Given the main
facts of the battle, granted the obvious
supposition that the king witnessed it,
and a place was bound to be provided
for him <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)nanti/on th=s *salami=nos</foreign>, pity that
the authorities could not agree whether
that place was at the top or the bottom
of the mountain! That Xerxes actually
ascended the Kerata is incredible.
Even if he was at Eleusis on the morning
of the battle, he would have hurried
eastwards when the true state of the
case was revealed by the early light.
The greater part of the battle he may
have actually overlooked from the
heights of <title>Skaramanga.</title> The oddity in
Aristodem. 1. 2 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kaqezo/menoi e)pi\ tou=
*pa/rnhqos o)/rous</foreign>) is surely a variant for
Aigaleos — the whole for the part.
Blakesley's ingenious hypothesis that
Xerxes began on the top of the mountain
and then descended to the neighbourhood
of the Herakleion does not really
bear out his own conclusion that “all
the varying accounts may have some
trnth in them,” for it ignores Akestodoros;
nor does it square with the probable
course of events: for at what hour did
Xerxes start on the top of the mountain?
Did he spend the night there? If not,
the unexpected course of events in the
morning would probably have upset the
plan of ascent. In any case, you inevitably
start at the bottom, not at the
top of a mountain: once up, no doubt
you are sure to come down. The traditional
site of the <title>Throne of Xerxes</title> is on
the hill fronting the road to the ferry,
a little beyond the supposed site of the
Herakleion. Lolling (Baedeker's <title>Greece</title>
p. 108) suggested the rocky promontory
of <title>Keratópyrgos,</title> which projects into
the bay about three-quarters of a mile
beyond the chapel of St. George, as the
point from which Xerxes witnessed the
battle, commanding as it does an
admirable survey of the straits. It is
now occupied by a powder magazine.
The partial coincidence between the
modern name of this promontory and
the Kerata, in Akestodoros, is curious.</p>

bit of scandal, due to the rivalry

by the Korinthians, who were supported
by the rest of Greece: Plutarch
<foreign rend="ital">de Hdti. malig.</foreign> 39 has an easy task in
refuting it, by the evidence of extant
monuments, and epitaphs and stories.
Dio Chrysostom (?) says, <title>Or.</title> 37. 7 (ed.
Teubner ii. p. 295), that the first draft of
Hdt.'s history did not contain the story,
and that Hdt. inserted it to revenge
himself for the refusal of the Korinthians
to give him money. The fact (of com
position) and the explanation can here
be distinguished. The explanation is
itself ‘malignant,’ and (as Plutarch
shows) the anecdote is hardly less to the
discredit of the Athenians than of th&lt;*&gt;
Korinthians — one might indeed say
more.</p>
<p>The story might well be an addition
an insertion, by the author, in a secon&lt;*&gt;
or third draft; it has the air of a&lt;*&gt;
anecdote, and Hdt. uses below one o&lt;*&gt;

most suggestive of oral sources; cp. In&lt;*&gt;

story must be, had the Athenians n&lt;*&gt;
excuse, no peg on which to hang the
scandal? If a detachment of the Persian
fleet had been sent to circumnavigate
Salamis, and to bar or to penetrate the
Megarid channel, a squadron of Greek

<pb n="505"/>
ships must have been detached to confront
the ‘barbarians’ and keep them
out. The 40 Korinthian ships may
have been detached on this service (cp.
the service of the 53 Athenian ships at
Chalkis, c. 14 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and may even
have had some fighting to do on their
own account. The Athenian travesty
need not be brought down to the date of
the Archidamian war in 431 B.C.; the
first Peloponnesian war in 458 B.C. would
be a possible occasion; but there was
already friction enough in 480 B.C. for
a deal of mutual scandal to be set afloat.</p></div>

According to <bibl n="Paus. 1.36.4">Pausan. 1. 36. 4</bibl> the oldest
temple of Athene Skiras was at Phaleron,
and had been founded by a diviner from
Dodona named <foreign xml:lang="greek">*ski=ros</foreign>, who had fallen
in the war between the Eleusinians and
Erechtheus, and had been buried, by
them, near a torrent, which afterwards,
as well as the place, was known by his
name. The temple here in question
cannot be the one at Phaleron; it is
plainly on Salamis. Strabo 393 gives
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*skira/s</foreign> as an old name of Salamis, ‘from
some hero,’ and therefrom derives also
the title of Athene. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">*skirwni\s o(do/s</foreign>
is not far off, cp. c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">ski=ros</foreign>
means hard, harsh (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sklh=ros</foreign>), and appears
in the names of rough places, cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*skiri=tis</foreign>.
The connexion with <foreign xml:lang="greek">ski/ron, *skirofo/ria</foreign>
(cp. Strabo <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) is doubtless based upon
a <title>Volksetymologie.</title> The temple on
Salamis may have had no proper connexion
with the temple at Phaleron.
As to its position: (i.) Stein places the
temple of Athene Skiras on the extreme
southern point of the island; the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/kron
to\ *skira/dion</foreign> is mentioned by Plutarch,
<title>Solon</title> 9, as apparently in the neigh bourhood
of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">xhlh/ tis pro\s th\n *eu)/boian</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)poble/pousa</foreign>, and &lt;*&gt;in  <title>Mor.</title> 870 (= <foreign rend="ital">de
Hdti. m.</foreign> 39) this episode is located <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri\
ta\ lh/gonta th=s *salamini/as</foreign>—which would
perhaps suit that ‘end’ of Salamis best.
If this view be correct the line of the
Korinthian flight would lie outside the
island, and be quite inconsistent with
any of the theories of the battle-lines.
(ii.) Leake, <title>Topogr. and Demi,</title> ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 171 ff.,
identified the spot with “the northwestern
promontory of Salamis” now
occupied by a monastery of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*panagi/a
fanerwme/nh</foreign> (the Virgin brought to light).
The monastery stands on the site of an
Hellenic building. This position would
suit the argument better; and the continued
existence of a sacred building is
in its favour. (iii.) Westermann <foreign rend="ital">ad</foreign>
Plutarch. makes it the extreme western
promontory of Salamis, nearest Megara.
This location suits best with the suggestion
above made in regard to the true
services of the Korinthians; morcover,
if one were eoncerned to rationalize the
incident of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ke/lhs</foreign> this position would
be the most intelligible: a message,
carried from the Greek fleet, across the
wasp's waist of Salamis, and then by
boat to Budoron, might easily have
‘met’ the Korinthians as they made
their way out of the straits.</p></div>

while Themistokles was in command of
the fleet?</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="3">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta/de e)poi/ee</lem></app>. There are three
accounts of the exploit, more or less
differing from each other, but substantially
reconcilable: (i.) Aischylos (<title>Persae</title>
447 ff.) places the affair late in the day
apparently, when the enemy's fleet has
been beaten, and there is nothing to
prevent the Greeks surrounding the
island with their own ships (Blakesley).
It is not, however, correct to say that
Aischylos represents the assault as made
by the actual crews of the vessels
(Rawlinson); and it is only fair to
observe that in Aischylos Xerxes is still
looking on. (ii.) Herodotus places the
exploit late in his narrative (perhaps in
conformity with Aischylos), but apparently
dates the affair earlier on the day
of battle (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n tw=| qoru/bw| tou/tw| ktl.</foreign>: cp.
c. 91 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). He does not explain how
Aristeides got his men on to the island:
boats may be supposed. A happy thought
apparently occurs to Aristeides while
the battle is raging, and he executes it
<foreign rend="ital">instanter.</foreign> (iii.) Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title> 9,
of course, goes further. Aristeides
observes that the island is strongly
occupied: puts picked volunteers in
boats, destroys all the Persians, except a
few (whom he sends to Themistokles,
three nephews of the king included, who
were immolated <foreign xml:lang="greek">w)mhsth=| *dionu/sw|</foreign>), and
occupies the whole shore of the island
with troops in order to assist the men of
the fleet in destroying the enemy. Yet
Plutarch may be substantially right.</p>
<p>The occupation of Psyttaleia by the
Persians on this occasion proved as great
a tactical blunder as the occupation of
Sphakteria by the Spartans in 425 B. C.,
and for the same reason, that the
occupants of the island were involved in
the fate of the fleet. But there was
more excuse for the Persian. The naval
superiority of the Greeks was not a foregone
conclusion, and the occupation of
Psyttaleia probably had as its ultimate
object a landing on Salamis, and an
assault upon the Greek forces in the
island. This aspect of the case makes
it not improbable that the Athenian
attack on the island should be placed <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n
tw=| qoru/bw|tou/tw|</foreign> with Hdt., with Plutarch,
and even possibly with Aischylos: it
was not a mere afterthought, or sequel
of the battle, but an essential part of it,
concerted, in all probability, between
Themistokles and Aristeides. The
Athenian hoplites remembered Marathon:
not a few of them had even
fought there.</p></div>

the first correct application of the
prophecy of Lysistratos, but dates the
true interpretation to the time of Salamis.
But the antiquity of the oracle demands
an earlier occasion; one might be found
in the great adventure of Solon at Kolias,
narrated in Plutarch, <title>Solon,</title> 8, which,
according to one account, led to the
Athenian capture of Salamis, though it
is easy to understand that the learned
Hellenes, interpreters of prophecy, in
discussing such matters, might gladly
have transferred, before the date of
Hdt.'s composition, the fulfilment of this
<foreign rend="ital">chresm</foreign> to the still grander occasion in
their own times. Solon's adventure was
scarcely remembered outside Athens—
and Megara! ‘The Hellenes’ here may
well be writers, even if Hdt. himself is

‘began’) to construct a mole right across
to Salamis,’ from the mainland. Hdt.
unfortunately does not locate the structure.
The time, the place, the nature
of the work, and its purpose, are all in
debate. The likeliest place would be
on the line of the existing ferry, both
because that is the shortest line, and
also because the island of <title>St. George</title>
offers a ready-made pier or <foreign rend="ital">point d' appui</foreign>
for the structure, though not on the
direct line, which would be less than a
mile across. Ktesias, <title>Persica,</title> ed. Gilmore,
§ 57, p. 157, locates the mole, and dates
the attempt before the battle: <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( de\
*ce/rchs au)to/qen e)lqw\n e)pi\ steino/taton th=s
*)attikh=s</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*(hra/kleion kalei=tai</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)xw/nnue
xw=ma e)pi\ *salami=na pezh= e)p' au)th\n diabh=nai
dianoou/menos</foreign>. The attempt is frustrated
by Themistokles and Aristeides,
who procure archers from Krete; and its
failure makes a sea-fight necessary. The
place may be right, ‘the narrowest part
of Attica’ being taken to mean the
narrowest part of the straits between
Attica and Salamis; the time, or sequence,
appears to be better in Hdt. To construct
a mole, or bridge of boats, all
across the straits, while the Greeks were
in possession, and without a naval battle,
was impossible. Moreover, before the
naval battle such a work would have
been inconsistent with the naval tactics.
If it had run (as Stein supposes) from
the Herakleion to Kynosura, it would
(if completed) have kept the king's fleet
out of the straits, and the Greek fleet
inside! But even running from the
extreme point of <title>Skaramanga</title> to the isle
of St. George, or (and) on to the actual
shore of Salamis, it could not have been
seriously undertaken before a naval
victory had cleared the Greek ships out
of the bay; and it would have interfered
with any design of circumnavigating
the island freely. Alexander, indeed,
attempted to take Tyre with a mole,
while the Tyrians had command of the
sea, Arrian 2. 18. But the two cases
are not parallel. Tyre was a fortified
island of small dimensions, half a mile
only off the coast, and not in any way
embayed; moreover, Alexander failed,
until he had secured command of the
sea, to capture the place. (Rawlinson
is wrong on this matter of fact.) Thus
a serious attempt to bridge the channel
to Salamis was absurd and impossible
without an antecedent naval victory;
after a naval defeat, still more so. It
follows that, if any such attempt at all
was made, it was a feint, or it was some
work completely misunderstood by Hdt.'s
sources and himself. Phoenician roundships
may have been lashed together,
the beginning of a mole or pier may
have been started, and this work may
have been begun before the naval engagement,
in confident anticipation of a
victory. After the naval defeat such
preparations could have deceived nobody,
and must have been abandoned. In
regard to the form of the structure
itself, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xw=ma</foreign> may have been intended
to serve as a solid pier leading on to
the round-ships, which would support
some sort of roadway, and could be
tugged into position after the Greek
fleet had been disabled. It is noticeable
that, even according to Hdt., preparations
for another naval battle are also
on foot; i.e. command of the sea must
be regained before the connexion with
Salamis could be established, over which
the land-forces might pour into the
island. Is it not also possible that the
projected or attempted structure was
rather of the nature of a wharf or jetty
or pier, for embarkation and so on, and
<pb n="511"/>
was never intended to reach the opposite

the Persian postal service is taken for

large force of picked men wherewith
to effect the conquest of Hellas. The
dismissal of the fleet was, perhaps, a

genuine? If not, which of the two is

accepts them both, seeing no more

challenged this passage and regarded
the genuine text as having run <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\
basile/i. tw=| megi/sth ti/sis ktl.</foreign> Stem
adopts and develops his arguments: (1)
The notice suits the context better in
Book 1 (where Hdt. is recording the
resistance offered to Harpagos by the
Pedasians). (2) Strabo 611, in citing,
cites from Bk. 1, not from this passage.
(3) The phraseology is not thoroughly
Herodotean, and betrays (Stem adds)
by incorrect turns the amateur of the
Hadrianic age: thus (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) for <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toi=si te
kai\ toi=si perioi/koisi</foreign> the interpolator here
has <foreign xml:lang="greek">toi=si a/mfiktuo/si</foreign>—leaving out <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toi=si/</foreign>;
(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa=si</foreign> is an addition, and an exaggeration;
(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) the preposition is incorrectly
used, with genitive, of place, probably
suggested by the falsified <foreign xml:lang="greek">a/mfiktuo/si</foreign>; (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)nto\s xro/nou</foreign> is <foreign rend="ital">de trop</foreign> (perhaps suggested
by <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(ka\s xro/nou</foreign> c. 144 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> Stein);
(<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">xalepo/n</foreign> is the forger's variant for
the Herodotean <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nepith/deion</foreign>; (<foreign rend="ital">f</foreign>) so too
<foreign xml:lang="greek">fu/ei</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/sxei</foreign>; (<foreign rend="ital">g</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">sumfe/retai</foreign> is also
hardly in order. These arguments are
cogent. (<foreign rend="ital">h</foreign>) The most remarkable difference
between the two passages is that
the miracle has happened <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/s</foreign> here, in
Bk. 8, as against <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/s</foreign> there in Bk. 1.
That is regarded as an oversight: a
curious one. Had the interpolator held
the opinion that the 8th Bk., or the
story of the Persian war, had been composed
by Hdt. previously to the composition
of the rest of the work, or of
Bk. 1, he could not have forged a better
bit of evidence! Moreover, he has
inserted this note on the Pedasians here
(by that theory at the earliest possible
chance) rather than in Bk. 5. 121, or
Bk. 6. 20, in either of which contexts
the note would be more consonant with
the context. It is impossible to maintain
the authenticity of this passage in
view of the objections; the other, on
the testimony of Strabo, is genuine.
This verdict sacrifices on the altar of
truth a telling argument in favour of the
priority of these Books. Fortunately,
enough remains to prove it. Cp. Introduction,
§§ 7, 8.</p></div></div>

we might infer that they only learnt the

if the fleet evacuated Phaleron immediately
after the battle, it had a long
start of the Greeks, who, whatever they
might desire or decide to do, could not
leave Salamis unprotected, until they
were assured that the Persian army too
was in full retreat. Was the pursuit of
the Persian fleet seriously intended? It
would certainly not have been lightly
undertaken, or without ardent debate.
Hdt. records just below a debate at
Andros; but the Hellenes can hardly
have rowed to Andros, whatever the
object of that movement, without a
previous council and discussion. Hdt.
has assuredly omitted to report a debate
at Salamis, after the victory.</p></div>

‘medized,’ cp. c. 66 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> and has special
reasons for medizing; cp. 7. 115 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></div>
<div type="commline" n="7">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)bouleu/onto</lem></app>: the scene, the speakers,
the subject, of this council, or debate,
are all open to challenge. For reasons
above given the Greek fleet can hardly
have quitted Salamis in pursuit of ‘the
flying Mede’: if the Greeks put into
Andros, which was a Persian outpost or
stronghold, it must have been with the
intention of ‘liberating’ or gaming the
island for the good cause; the attack on
Andros, and the medizing islands, will
have been resolved upon before the
Greeks left Salamis. Hdt. treats this
operation as a matter of course, or as
the obvious alternative to a pursuit of
the ‘barbarian’ fleet (c. 111 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>); but
it will have required an express decision,
even if covered by the general vow
against the medizers (7. 132). Again,
Eurybiades here appears as taking part
in the debate, and as the opponent of
Themistokles; dramatic, and perhaps
constitutional proprieties are better
observed above in the accounts of the
debates before Salamis, where Korinthian
opposes Athenian, or in the variant on
this very anecdote, which pits Aristeides
against Themistokles (cp. Appendix VII.
§ 2). The Spartan has perhaps come in
as the exponent of the characteristically
Lakonian policy, not to pursue a flying
foe. The plan ascribed to Themistokles
is here expressed in almost self-contradictory
terms, or as combining incompatible
objects: <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ nh/swn trape/sqai:
&lt;*&gt;pidiw=cai ta\s ne/as: ple/ein i)qe/ws e)pi\ t.
*(ell. lu/sontas ta\s gefu/ras</foreign> (i.e.  <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ t.
*(ell. pleu/santas lu=sai t. g.</foreign>). The first
phrase may be ambiguous, covering alike
operations against the islands (the
Kyklades) in succession, and a passage
through them without touching; but
the ideas of pursuing the Persian fleet
and of sailing for the Hellespont to
destroy the bridges could only be
harmonized on the assumption that the
Persian fleet had made for the Hellespont;
and even so, the pursuit of the
<pb n="526"/>
fleet might involve a second engagement,
which might prove an obstacle to
destroying the bridges. Possibly all
three ideas (i. the destruction of the
bridges; ii. the pursuit of the flying
Phoenicians; iii. the visitation of the
medizing islands) were traditionally and
rightly associated with Themistokles;
but they should not have been given to
him in one breath!</p></div>

<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ti/qeto th\n yh=fon</foreign>. The opinion ascribed

for Greece is doubly refuted, (i.) by the
apprehension previously ascribed to

The argument which follows (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s a)/gonti

destruction of the bridges is to compel
the Persian to the conquest of Europe;

are ignored. The whole passage reads
like an estimate of the necessity for
active and offensive measures on the
invader's part before the invasion, or at
least before his defeat, a necessity which
was not conditioned simply by the
existence or non-existence of the bridges;

Eurybiades the Spartan is represented
as saying—and so say all of the Peloponnesian
commanders—that the Persians
would not remain in Europe after the
defeat at Salamis. This prognostication
is abundantly nullified, not merely by
the commission of Mardonios, but even
after Plataia by the remnant in Thrace,
cp. 7. 106, 107 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> It is, however,
possible that the formula represents
accurately enough the Spartan and
‘Peloponnesian’ point of view, or hope:
the more plausible, if the Greeks had
already witnessed the evacuation of
Attica by the land-forces of the barbarian.
Even when later the Spartans must have
been convinced that the Persian had
not abandoned Europe, or even Hellas,
in spite of his defeat at Salamis, they
were still hoping to avoid any necessity
for another land engagement; cp.

not rather a testimony to the first and
fundamental principles of Themistoklean
strategy, which had already, and even

movement as the best means of relieving
the tension in Greece? After all, ‘the

Nine Ways 7. 114, at Sepias 7. 191).
Athenians naturally made the most of
the point (cp. <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 805">Aischyl. <title>Pers.</title> 805</bibl> f.),
though their own record was not clean
in this respect (cp. 5. 102); but it was
left for Cicero to represent the Persians
as Puritan fanatics, indignant with the
Greeks for believing that the gods could
be enclosed ‘in temples made with
hands’ (<cit><bibl n="Cic. Leg. 2.10"><title>de legg.</title> 2. 10. 26</bibl> <quote xml:lang="la">Xerxes

by what is known of the policy of
Dareios and his successors in Egypt, in
Babylon, in Greece itself—to say
nothing of the acts of Kyros and Kambyses.
The invasion of Greece was in
no sense a crusade or religious war, but
the Greeks naturally enough invested
their victory with a religious halo, and
exaggerated the offences against the
national religion committed by the
Persians as incidents of the campaign.
Hence the intensely religious tone of the
Herodotean narrative, little as the great
centres of the national religion did for
Greece in her hour of need. Hence
too the decree, or supposed decree, that
the temples destroyed by the Persian
should remain for ever in ruins (cp. the
forged oath in Lycurgus <foreign rend="ital">c. Leocrat.</foreign> 81,

Themistokles appears to share
theillusion (ascribed above to Eurybiades)
that Salamis had put an end to the
presence of the ‘barbarian’ in Greece.
Stein, indeed, takes the sentence as
conditional, and refers it not to the
battle which has taken place, but to
the land-engagement, which Themistokles
expects to be fought before the winter
(i.e. not “now that we have driven,”
but “as soon as we shall have driven
the barbarian clean away”). This interpretation
(i.) ill suits the context,
especially the corresponding passage c.
108 <foreign rend="ital">ad fin.;</foreign> (ii.) involves Themistokles
in a huge misconception in regard to
the probable action of the Peloponnesians;
(iii.) makes him treat a great land-battle
immediately to come as a foregone
conclusion, to be mentioned <foreign rend="ital">en passant,</foreign>
sandwiched between the restoration of
Athens and the expedition to the Hellespont;
while (iv.) Hdt. himself declares
the <foreign rend="ital">rusé</foreign> character of Themistokles'
advice to the Athenians; and although
the purpose he assigns is unacceptable
(see below), the possibility remains open
that the argument of the speaker is a
make-believe. In fact, the words, if
<pb n="531"/>
authentic, may have been used by
Themistokles with his eyes open, and
his participation in the Spartan illusion,
that no land - battle would ever be
necessary, may have been a voluntary
hypothesis, <foreign rend="ital">argumenti causa.</foreign> So, too,
the promise to sail to the Hellespont
and Ionia in the spring might at this
point have been rather a concession to
gain the Athenians, and to prevent the
break-up of the fleet, than a deliberate
plan, in view of the utter discomfiture
of the Persian, or in anticipation of
the subsequent policy of reprisals. It
would, however, be a possible preventive
of the re-invasion of Attica, in case the
Persians had not evacuated Europe: as
applicable in the spring as in the present
autumn. The whole discussion (it must
be remembered) can hardly have taken
place until the Persians had evacuated
Attica, and probably did not take place
at Andros, but at Salamis. Whether
Themistokles, when he realized that
Mardonios was still in Greece with an
army, failed to grasp the strategic
aspects of the case, is a further question
(cp. Appendix VII. § 1). It is at least
arguable that the greatest of the
Athenians never had any illusions upon
the point.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="22">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tau=ta e)/lege a)poqh/khn me/llwn
poih/sasqai</lem></app>. This contribution to the
Themistoklean legend represents him as
a traitor from the beginning. The
motivation is plainly an inference from
the event (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta/ per w)=n kai\ e)ge/neto</lem></app>), and
is both psychologically and historically
bad. There is an assumption involved
that Themistokles did wrong in dissuading
the Athenians from sailing off by
themselves from Andros (or Salamis?)
to the Hellespont, and his crime is the
more flagrant seeing that he himself had
advocated the move to the Hellespont
just before. But Themistokles was
neither inconsequent nor disloyal if he
now wrought with the Athenians to
prohibit a schismatic undertaking:
rather might Hdt. have pronounced
such an eulogy upon his act as Thucydides
pronounced upon the act of
Alkibiades in retaining the Athenian
fleet at Samos in 411 B. C. from precipitately
making for the city (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 8.82.2">Thuc.
8. 82. 2</bibl>). Strategically, the separate
adventure of the Athenians must have
been highly precarious; politically, it
might have shattered the Alliance, which
still had work to do: the reduction of
the Kyklades by the confederate fleet
was both strategically and politically
the better investment. In so far as
Hdt. (or his source) ascribes to Themistokles
a prevision of possible disaster
to himself in time to come, and sets
him about making provision against a
turn of Fortune's wheel, the bounds of
psychological possibility are not passed,
for a Greek and a Themistokles. Of
such reverses, too, he could say: <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\
au)to\s h)/dh polloi=si paregeno/mhn kai\
pollw=| ple/w a)kh/koa toia/de gene/sqai</foreign>. The
trophies of Miltiades were before his
eyes day and night. But there is no
real relation between his reported advice
on this occasion and his subsequent
‘medism’—such as it was. The motivation
here depends upon the truth of the
story (in the next c.) of the second
mission of Sikinnos—and that story is
a transparent fraud. Grote, indeed,
credits the view that Themistokles—“a
clever man, tainted with such constant
guilt”—calculated on being one day
detected and punished; i.e. Grote takes
the Themistokles-legend very much at
its own estimation. Blakesley's note is
curiously perverse, amounting to this:
Thucydides is wrong in saying that
Themistokles claimed credit in his letter
to Artaxerxes (1. 137) for having saved
the bridge for Xerxes, while Hdt. is
right in saying that Themistokles,
not knowing that the bridges were
already broken down in 480 B. C. (if
they were; cp. c. 117. 4 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), intended,
on some future occasion, should need
arise, to claim credit with the king for
saving the bridge!</p>

deceived in his confidential agents,
from whose lips tortures were not to

Sikinnos himself perhaps, the authority
for this story? And who was to torture
them—the king? the Athenians? To
the king they were carrying the message;
he had no need to torture them in order
to learn it. The phrase looks as though
some of the domestics of Themistokles
had been put to the ‘question’ (say, in
471-70 B. C.) to prove his ‘medism’; but
whether anything like this anecdote was
extracted from them is doubtful; the
phrase might even suggest a negation.
Themistokles was, indeed, himself the
author of the fiction that Xerxes owed
to him the preservation of the Hellespontine
bridges (cp. Thuc. 1. 134).
The letter of the exiled Athenian to
Artaxerxes (in 465 B. C?) is the earliest
source to which the fiction can be traced:
his enemies apparently improved the
occasion, and elaborated the version preserved
by Herodotus. Cp. Appendix

Blakesley remarks that in the time of

retreat of Xerxes by sending him word
of the projected Greek move to the

the animus is obvious. Neither the
case of the Andrians nor that of the
other islanders looks at all like an
instance of the private greed of Themistokles.
In his previous career the only
allegation of corrupt and avaricious
practice is the story of his bribery by
the Euboians (cc. 4, 5 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), the
inconsequence and absurdity of which
are self-evident. Rawlinson refers to
the well - known lines of Timokreon
(Plutarch <title>Them.</title> 21) to show that such
charges were brought against Themistokles
during his lifetime: no doubt
—but were they proved? During and
<pb n="536"/>
after the Persian war they arose and
accumulated. Themistokles was probably
a wealthy man, at the time of his
exile (Kritias <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Aelian. <title>Var. Hist.</title> 10.
17), but there is no evidence to show
how much, if any, of his fortune was
obtained by illegitimate means; and it
is quite certain that most of the anecdotes
to illustrate the charge of avarice are
apoeryphal. Thucydides 1. 138. 3 neither
condemns nor acquits him; ep. 2. 65. 8

the speeification of the two places, both

relations with Themistokles. Both
places were of considerable importance
in connexion with the Persian wars and
the <foreign rend="ital">thalattocracy</foreign> of Athens. The subsequent
reduction of Karystos was of
sufficient interest to obtain an express
notice from Thucydides (1. 98, 3); cp.

and Hdt. records below (c. 121)
that Karystos was ‘visited’ before the

reduction of the Karystians—evidently
no easy task—was not accomplished
until after the ostrakism, or perhaps the
condemnation, of Themistokles. (Cp.

It may be true that Attica was

must have remained at Salamis. (Is it

one and the same road: unfortunately
he does not specify which of the two or
three possible alternatives (Eleutherai<pb n="538"/>
Eleusis, Panakton - Phyle, TanagraDekeleia).
Unless the land-force was
very small, no doubt more than one

the verb is used in two senses: ‘appeared
good’ and simply ‘appeared,’ or ‘thought
right’ and ‘thought.’ Mardonios might
have remained in occupation of Attiea,
but the season was late for campaigning,
supplies probably were difficult to
procure so far south, and he wished to
see the king well out of Greece. How
far Hdt. had any definite information
about the motives of Mardonios it is not
easy to say; the intention <foreign xml:lang="greek">peira=sqai th=s
*peloponnh/sou</foreign> (cp. c. 100 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) was never
realized, and the retreat into winter
quarters in Thessaly was hardly the best
prognostic of it. Attica seems to have
been really evaeuated; but it is searcely
likely that Boiotia, Thermopylar, and
Central Greece were wholly denuded of
Persian troops. At the same time, the
naval superiority of the Greeks after
Salamis might (had they known how
to use it) have made the oceupation
of Central Greece impractieable. Cp.

only diseovered as a result of the <foreign rend="ital">levée
en masse,</foreign> when its numerical aspect is
tested and proved!). Mardonios pursues
two methods in his selection: certain
nations, to wit, Persians, Medes, Scyths,
Baktrians, Indians, he selects in full, as
they stand; but of the remaining (42)
nations he only takes such individuals
as are of obvious value or of made
reputation. Probably the five nations
named supplied the bulk of the army of
Mardonios. The omission of the Kissians,
however, is remarkable (were they chiefly
in the <foreign rend="ital">corps d'armée</foreign> of Artabazos?).</p>
<p>But we may safely assert that if the
total forces left with Mardonios comprised,
even nommally, thirty myriads,
then there was no selection, he retained
the army of Xerxes in full: if there was
a real selection, then his forces amounted
to nothing like thirty myriads; cp.

is this period intended to cover the
march from Thessaly to the Hellespont
only, or the whole course from Athens?
If the latter, are ‘the few days’ which
elapsed between the battle and the
move from Athens (c. 113 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)
included or not? As forty - five days
would be a longish time to spend over
the march from Thessaly, the latter
alternative, in one form or other, is to
be preferred. In this case the exact
figure would be more convincing if it
did not happen to be exactly half the
time consumed in the advance from the
Hellespont to Athens, c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> (3
months = 90 days). In 394 B. C. Agesilaos
marched from the Hellespont to Boiotia
in a month, or less (Beloch, <title>Gr. Ges.</title>
ii. 196); cp. Xenoph. <title>Ages.</title> 2. 1. But
then he had only a relatively small
force with him: Xenophon does not
give the exact figures. Before the
battle of Koroneia reinforcements had
reached the king, and he was not
inferior in numbers to the allied army
opposed to him, which, a little while
before, at the battle of Korinth, had
<pb n="542"/>
numbered 24,000 hoplites with 1550
cavalry, and numerous light-armed
troops; cp. Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 4. 1, 2. 16 ff.,

was escorted by Artabazos with 60,000
of the said 300,000 (cp. c. 126 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>).
The phrase here is apparently intended
to introduce the result of the losses <foreign rend="ital">en
route</foreign> between Thessaly and Sardes; but
these losses are themselves to be heavily
discounted in the light of that authentic
escort. The millions which had accompanied
Xerxes into Greece had to be
disposed of somehow: he sheds most of
them on the way home! Have the
flight and sufferings of the survivors of
Plataia been antedated and transferred
to the escort of Xerxes, a year before?
But even in the later disaster, Artabazos
carries a substantial remnant home to
Asia (9. 89). The rectification of the
numbers of the host of Xerxes tends to
adjust the proportion of losses. Bad as
this passage in Hdt. may be, as regards
horrors and exaggerations, he is by no
means the worst offender: his predecessor
Aischylos (<title>Persae</title> 484-516) and Trogus

The visit of Themistokles to Lakedaimon
in the autumn or winter (480-79) was
probably by invitation (cp. Plutarch
<title>Themist.</title> 17), and may have had deeper
political and diplomatic ends in view

reckoned with.</p>
<p>The honours heaped upon the Athenian
in Sparta <bibl n="Diod. 11.27">Diodoros 11.27</bibl> (Ephoros) traces
to Spartan apprehensions of reprisals on
the part of the Athenians and Themistokles,
for the set-back after Salamis;
they may have been intended, at least in
part, to promote a naval policy for the
future (cp. <foreign rend="ital">c.</foreign> 108 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), as well as to
reward its past success. They do not
appear to have turned his head, much less
won Themistokles to sacrifice Athenian
to Spartan interests. Within a twelvemonth
he is in Sparta again, for a very
different purpose, and at considerable
risk to himself; cp. Thucyd. 1. 89-92.
The Themistoklean legend had attempted
to discount his services to Athens in
Sparta by ignoring the visit after PlataiaMykale,
and caricaturing the visit after
Salamis; Thucydides' record is a part of
the <title>Rettung</title> of Themistokles, which he
favours. Cp. Appendix VII. § 4.</p></div>

is urgently ealled for. The omission
points to the mutual independence of
the various sources employed by Hdt.,
and also to his failure to fuse them into
a consistent whole; cp. Introduction,
§ 10. The story here told of Artabazos
reduees even the comparatively unexaggerated
record of the ‘flight’ of
Xerxes given by Hdt. above to an
absurdity. Stein remarks that Hdt.
speaks with such transparent good-will
and such speeial knowledge of Artabazos
that we may infer personal relations
between the historian and the man's
family, or even the man himself. Aitabazos
became satrap of Daskyleion in
476 B. C. in order to further the treason
of Pausanias, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.129.1">Thuc. 1. 129. 1</bibl>. Pharnakes,
son of Pharnabazos (<bibl n="Thuc. 2.67.1">Thuc. 2. 67. 1</bibl>),
plainly a near relative, is found there
431-414 B. C., and was in turn succeeded
by his own son, Pharnabazos, 413-388
B. C. (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.6.1">Thuc. 8. 6. 1</bibl>). An Artabazos
appears again in possession of the same
satrapy (360-53 B. C.); cp. Krumbholz,
<foreign rend="ital">de Asiae min. Satrapis</foreign> (1883), p. 73.
Stein regards Tritantaichmes, son of
‘Artabazos,’ the satrap of Babylon (1.
192), as another of his sons (but cp. notes
to 7. 82, 121 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and apparently thinks
that Hdt. found him as satrap in Babylon.

The revolt of all the towns on Pallene
appears as a direct result of the battle
of Salamis. As they were the first to
disown the Persian yoke, so were they
probably among the first to enter the
Delian League (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.18.5">Thuc. 5. 18. 5</bibl>). The
proximity of Makedon, and its relations
with the Persian, were calculated to

in the story of the siege of Poteidaia in
480-79 B. C. which follows, to the siege
of Poteidaia in 432 B. C. and the following
years (Thucyd. i. 58, etc.), is observable,
and makes against the theory that Hdt.
was composing these Books for the first
time about the time of the outbreak of
the Peloponnesian war. This story may
well belong to the first draft of the
work, and he has not inserted into this
context any late reference; the latest
hint of the final revision of these Books
occurs above in 7. 137. Perhaps Hdt.
was not aware of the fall of Poteidaia in
the winter of 430-29 B. C., Thuc. 2. 70,
though he can hardly have been ignorant
of the Athenian blockade, and may have
avoided express reference to its prolongation
out of respect for Athenian susceptibilities.

would, indeed, have been remarkable:
but was not the guilt to some extent
inferred from the doom, on the wellestablished
canon which condemned the
Galileans on whom the tower in Siloam
fell as sinners above all Galileans?
Hdt. is less of a critic in this passage
than in his rationale of Poseidonian
action at Tempe, 7. 129 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Perhaps
the direct intervention of the deity was
more intelligible to him, in a case of
human <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)se/beia</foreign>, than in the case of a
natural object. Hdt. does not indeed
here actually specify the personal action
of the outraged god; but he must be
supposed to have taken it for self-evident,
between the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)se/beia</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">r(hxi/h</foreign>.
Poteidaia is, of course, a city of Poseidon:
Poseidon Hippios appears on its coinage,
<pb n="558"/>
and Head (<title>Hist. Num.</title> p. 188) regards
the type of the tetradrachm as “doubtless
suggested by the sacred image of
Poseidon, which Herodotus mentions as
standing in front of the city, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n tw=|
proastei/w|</foreign>.” The city itself appears to
have been situate astride the isthmus,
fortified north and south by two parallel
walls, and protected east and west by
the sea. The object of the Persians was
to enter the city round the sea end of
the wall (just as Aristeus did in 432 B. C.,
Thuc. 1. 53). Stein's idea that Poteidaia
was not fortified on the S. side appears
to arise from a misinterpretation of
the words in <cit><bibl n="Thuc. 1.54.2">Thuc. 1. 54. 2</bibl> <quote xml:lang="greek">to\ d' e)s th\n

stomach for fighting at sea: at the same
time they are described as planning at
Samos how they may injure the enemy
—a fruitless quest, if they were not
prepared to move at sea. The hopes and
attention concentrated on Mardonios
suggest that the fleet was to be prepared
to act, at least on the receipt of good
news, and possibly upon the receipt of
bad news. Though now far apart, the
fortunes and acts of fleet and of army
could not be matters of indifference,
even strategically, one to the other.
Hdt.'s motivations are seldom quite
adequate or satisfactory; but in regard
to the movements, and even the mind

he probably had access to Ionian sources,

weak the argument from the

Hdt. would have reserved these pedigrees
throughout his work for the sake of
especially glorifying Leonidas and Leotychidas
at the end, the latter of whom
had little claim to any special honour.
The pedigree of Leotychidas is interesting
as proving the distinction between
generations and reigns, owing to the
especial circumstances of the succession
in his case: one has to go back eight
generations (inclusive) from Leotychidas
to find the king (Theopompos, 13th from

in the reigning house of
Eurypontids (Prokleids), though never
borne by an Agid (Eurysthenid) king.
Thus this grandson of Theopompos may
have been named from his uncle (through
whom the sceptre descended), and no
less than five kings in all bore the name,
of whom the best known was Hdt.'s contemporary,
who succeeded Leotychidas.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)anacandri/dew</lem></app>: the name Anaxandridas
is familiar as that of the (15th)
Agid king, son of Leon, and father of
Kleomenes, as of Dorreus, Leonidas, and
Kleombrotos; cp. 7. 204 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> This
Anaxandridas, 14th in descent from
Herakles, is not otherwise known to
fame than as the founder of the cadet
branch of the Eurypontids (Prokleids).
His name corresponds with that of his
brother Archidamos in the now elder
branch of the House. This Archidamos
was never king; Theopompos was
succeeded by his grandson Zeuxidamos
(<bibl n="Paus. 3.7.5">Pausan. 3. 7. 5</bibl>). It is rather odd that
the Eurypontid (Prokleid) succession in
the eighth century B.C. should thus anticipate,
with so nice a difference, the
succession in the fifth century B.C., when
Zeuxidamos, son of Leotychidas, predeceased
his father, leaving an Archidamos
to succeed; cp. 6. 71 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> the
story preserved in Pausanias looks like
fiction modelled on the facts of the fifth
century. The Eurypontid line of kings
would seem to be longer-lived, or longerreigned,
than the Agid, for Leotychidas
is but the 16th king, and in the 16th
generation, from Aristodamos, while
Leonidas is the 18th king in the elder
House; and this discrepancy is rather
increased than diminished subsequently;
but then the lists of kings, and even the
genealogies, are not above suspicion.
With Hdt. Leonidas and Leotychidas
are in the same generation (21st) from
Herakles.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="7">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*qeopo/mpou</lem></app>: on Hdt.'s own showing

This is the only passage in which the
name of this king—of whom later writers
have so much to tell us—occurs in the
work of Hdt. A great external crisis,
the ‘first’ Messenian war (Pausan. 4.
<pb n="562"/>
4. 3), and a great internal development,
the institution of the Ephors (Aristot.
<title>Pol.</title> 8. 11. 2=1313 A), were dated to his
reign. The story of the Messenian wars
is virtually a lost chapter in Spartan
history to Hdt (cp. 3 47, the sole
articulate reference in the work): the
Ephoralty he expressly ascribes to
Lykourgos, 1. 65. The importance of
King Theopompos dates apparently from
the Delphic researches of the (Agid)
King Pausanias early in the fourth
century B.C. Cp. Ed. Meyer, <title>Forschungen,</title>

something to say of him: Plutarch <title>Mor.</title>
250 records three apophthegms (one of
them addressed to an Athenian, and
assuredly not earlier than the fifth

associates his name especially with the
invasion of Argolis.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*xari/lew</lem></app>: Charilaos is 7th king

the <title>Politics</title> of Aristotle in two forms,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*xa/rillos</foreign> (2. 10. 2=1271 B) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*xari/laos</foreign>
(8. 12. 12=1316 A); and later tradition
had something to say of him,
making him out a ‘tyrant,’ yet also
the nephew and ward of Lykourgos,
and associated in his Reforms (Plutarch
<title>Lykourg.</title> 5). This latter point is in
direct conlict with Hdt. 1. 65, where
Lykourgos appears associated with the
elder House, two (or, as the Greeks
would have said, three) generations
earlier. Pausanias (2. 36. 5, 3 7. 3,
4. 4. 3), who gives the father's name as
Polydektes (not Eunomos), reversing the
Herodotean order, represents Charillos as
engaged in war especially with Argos
and with Tegea (<foreign rend="ital">ll c.</foreign>), and as taken
prisoner by the Tegeatai (<bibl n="Paus. 8.5.6">8. 5. 6</bibl>) but
liberated after swearing that the Lakedaimonians
should never again invade
Argolis, an oath soon broken (<bibl n="Paus. 8.48.5">8. 48. 5</bibl>).
Hdt. can hardly have been acquainted
with this story (obviously an Argive
tale) when he wrote 1. 66.</p>

is the fact that the lists followed by
Pausanias reversed the order of the

really Eurypon who established the

for it, in the constitution of Sparta,
the dual royalty only dating from his

strange story of the ruse by which
Eurypon obtained possession of the city
of Mantineia for the Lakedaimonians,
a story which suffers under a double
anachrouism, in crediting Mantineia
with a democracy, and the democracy
with surrendering the city to Eurypon.</p>
<p>Stein<hi rend="sup">2</hi> wished to insert <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= *so/ou</foreign> after

purpose of harmonizing Hdt. with
Pausanias and with himself (1. 65, 67),
as Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> avers. But in reality it would
have the effect of dislocating Hdt. himself,
whose pedigrees of the two Houses
correspond generation by generation,
and king for king, as above shown.
Hdt. is plainly of a different opinion to
Pausanias, 3. 1. 7, in regard to the
correspondences.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*pro/kleos</lem></app>: the 2nd king in
Sparta (reckoning Aristodemos), the
6th descendant of Herakles, the twinbrother
of Eurysthenes, and the apparent,
though not the nominal founder, not the
Eponym, of the younger House; cp.
previous note. With Prokles we pass
on to ground already familiar, cp. 6. 52,
4. 147 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The legend of the twins
is, of course, an aetiological fiction.
Pausanias has nothing to add to the
stories in Hdt., but Polyainos again (1.
10) opposes the ‘Herakleid’ Prokles to
the ‘Eurystheids’ who were in possession
of Sparta, and has him win a victory
over them, thanks to his pipers. This
sporadic tradition is perhaps the most
suggestive, the most historic-looking
fossil, in the legendary records of Sparta.
The name Prokles is borne by many
historical personages, cp. 3. 50 (au
Epidaurian), Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 3. 1. 6 (cp.

Mardonios and the Persian forces behind

Delos they were considerably more than
half-way from Aigina to Samos. This is
the only passage in these Books in which
‘the Herakleian Pillars’ are mentioned:
indeed, save for the mention of them in
2. 33, they are only mentioned in Bk. 4
(and therein seven times, cc. 8, 43, 152,
181, 185, 196), a striking illustration of
the ‘Western’ interest in that Book
The form of the designation in Hdt. is
always adjectival (never <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(hrakle/os sth=lai</foreign>,
as in Strabo 169), and the passages cited
leave no room for doubt as to its
geographical significance (=straits of
Gibraltar), but Hdt. nowhere indicates
exactly what he understands by the
phrase. His contemporary Euktemon,
of Athens, apparently understood the
expression to apply to two Islands, 30
stades distant from each other, covered
with wood, and inaccessible for large
vessels, and each provided with a temple
and an altar of Herakles: Euktemon <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Avienum, <title>Or. maritim.</title> ed. A. Holder (cp.
Berger, <title>Gesch. d. Wissensch. Erdkunde,</title>
ii. 67). Pomponius Mela (temp.
Claudii), a native of the region, considered
the Pillars, or Columns, to be the
two mountains, Calpe (<title>Gibraltar</title>) and
Abyla (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)abi/luka</foreign>. Strabo 170: <title>Ceuta</title>),
rising on the European and African side
of the straits respectively (2 6. 96: cp.
Bunbury, <title>Anc. Geogr.</title> 11. 358). Poseidonios,
however, his predecessor, who
spent a considerable time at Gades
(Strabo 174), believed that the Pillars
were literally Pillars, to wit, the bronze
Pillars 8 cubits (12 feet) high in the
Herakleion at Gades; cp. Strabo 170,
where the various alternatives (including
that afterwards favoured by Mela) are
set out and discussed, Strabo himself
finally inclining to the metaphorical
meaning (but not deciding between
‘islands’ and ‘mountains’). Our

ance of Pillar-worship (cp. A. J. Evans,
<title>Mycenaean Tree and Pillar Cult,</title> 1901),
and its undoubted association with the
Tyrian Herakles (cp. Hdt. 2. 44) might
incline us to take the western ‘Pillars of
Herakles’ as really marking the limits
of Phoenician navigation, and the metaphorical
application as an afterthought;
but such phrases as <foreign xml:lang="greek">di) *(hrakle/wn sthle/wn
e)kple/ein, diekpera=n</foreign> (4. 42, 43, 152) suggest
that Hdt. uses the phrase with the
metaphorical reference, and would have
set the pillars either side the strait.
The statement that “the Greeks at
Delos (in 479 B.C.) believed (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)piste/ato
do/ch|</lem></app>, an interesting collocation) Samos
as far off (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)pe/xein</lem></app>, cp. 9. 52 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) as
Gades” is characterized by Rawlinson
as “perhaps the grossest instance in
Hdt. of rhetorical exaggeration” (5.
97 runs it close). But it should not be
put down primarily to Hdt., least of all
with the object, “by an imaginary effect
of contrast, to place in a more striking
light the rapid increase during his own
time of nautical power and enterprise
among his European fellow-countrymen”
(Mure, quoted by Blakesley <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>).
Nor is it to be treated (so by Blakesley
himself) as a serious record of real
matter of fact, or feeling, explicable by
the evil associations which had gathered
at Sparta round “the voyage to Samos”
(cp. 3. 56). The case is really much
simpler. The phrase reproduces the
impatience of Hdt.'s Ionian source with
the cautious policy of the Spartan
navarch (for which there were good
grounds enough); or perhaps it even reflects
the scornful witticisms of a period,
the <title>Pentekontaeteris,</title> when Athenian
policy had practically made the Aegean
a <foreign rend="ital">mare clausum</foreign> to Peloponnesian longships.
At Delos the Hellenic fleet was
in sight of Samos on a clear day, and
before very long, in this very same year,
crossed boldly to that bourne (9. 90 ff.)
Hdt.'s device of projecting this account
of the naval movement into the record
of the previous winter and early spring
has softened the inconsequence. What
kept the Greek fleet at Delos was, first,
that they demanded further assurances
from the Ionians, and secondly, that
they had to consider the situation
behind them in Greece. Cp. Appendix

in the cult of Trophonios, <bibl n="Paus. 9.39.5">Pausan. 9.

properly by a deputy, or deputy's

The oracle was, of course, chthonian,

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">katabh=nai para\ *trofw/nion</lem></app>: the
grove (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/lsos</foreign>) of Trophonios was situate

Several days' preparation and initiation
were necessary before the votary
was permitted ‘to descend’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s tou=

was reserved for the male sex (cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/ndra</foreign>
here, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndri/</foreign> Pausanias <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>). Purifications,
divinations, sacrifices, are the
order of the day, culminating in the
offering of a ram on the night of the
actual descent. You are first washed in
the Herkyna, a&lt;*&gt; anointed, by two
acolytes, or ‘Hermai, the priests then
take you in hand, give you to drink of
the waters of Oblivion and of Remembrance,
display to your adoring gaze the
ancient image, and invest you with
proper garb, for the dire ordeal. You
then essay ‘the descent’ into the house
of Trophonios. In the oracular chamber
is a mysterious opening, or well, carefully
built round and over, about six
feet in diameter, and some twelve feet
in depth, looking like an oven. Into
this pit you descend by a light ladder,
introduced for the purpose, taking some
honey - buns with you (cp.  <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 507">Aristoph.
<title>Clouds</title> 507</bibl> f.). Arrived at the bottom,
you find a small opening at one side, just
large enough to admit you feet foremost:
you lie down on your back and work
through it; and no sooner have your
knees passed the aperture than you find
yourself suddenly and irresistibly drawn
or sucked down into the Holy of holies.
There the secrets of the future are
revealed to you in a way over which
Pausanias somewhat abruptly drops the
curtain. The exit has to be effected by
the same entrance (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sto/ma to\ i(ero/n</foreign>), and
again feet foremost. By this time you are
more dead than alive, but the ordeal is
not over. The priests set you on the
seat of Remembrance, and question you
on what you have seen and heard below:
after they have obtained the requisite
information, they return you to your
anxious relatives or attendants, who
convey you, in a state of trance or
unconsciousness, back to your apartment
at the sign of ‘Good Luck and the
Daimon.’ But do not despair: no
proper consultant has ever been known
to expire under the ordeal, and some
have lived to smile again after it.</p>

was not the work of the division of the
army commanded by Mardonios—but
according to Blakesley himself Mardonios

divination there; at Harma, however,
near Mykalessos, there was a temple

that Alexander was at this time king in

omits reference to Alexander's true

a little thin: more probably Hdt. takes
over the phrase from his source, whatever
it was; an explanation which, it
must be admitted, only puts the
difficulty one step backwards: perhaps
the recognition of this passage as
relatively early in Hdt.'s composition

suggested that the connexion was with
the Peisistratids, not with the Athenian
democracy; cp. 5. 94. But there may
have been some approximation during
the period of the Ionian Revolt. The
story here is doubtless tinged with afterthought
and anachronism; following
the Persian war there must have been
friendly relations between Athens and
Makedon for a time, or off and on, during
Alexander's reign. Athenian aggression
in the north, culminating in the foundation
of Amphipolis in 436 B.C. (Busolt
III. i. 558), must have strained these
relations; and it is quite clear from
Thucydides that the hostility of Perdikkas,
son of Alexander, precipitated
the (so-called) ‘Peloponnesian’ war

<p>Hdt. fully endorses this calculation
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta/ per a)\n kai\ h)=n</lem></app>): alliance with Athens
would have given Mardonios, and Persia,
a vast superiority at sea.</p>
<p>Mardonios can hardly have failed to
understand (what Hdt. appears in this
place to miss) that the predominance at
sea would <foreign rend="ital">ipso facto</foreign> carry predominance
by land too—not merely by withdrawing
the Athenian land - force from the confederate
army, and completely localizing
resistance in the Peloponnese, but by
opening wide the doors into the Peloponnese
itself—as Hdt. elsewhere and
afterwards implies (9. 9 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> cp. 7. 139
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). In this passage command of
the sea is treated as a pnrely negative
condition, however important, and
Mardonios having obtained it, by
alliance with Athens, is to finish the
struggle on land simply with his own
land-forces.</p>
<p>The passage also runs into a somewhat

below. In any case Hdt. was hardly
the first author to reduce it to writing,
or even to prose: that had surely
been done already at the Makedomian
Court. Thucydides in 2. 99. 3 asserts
the Argive and Temenid descent, in 2.
100. 2 gives the same number of kings
(without the names), adding Perdikkas
and Archelaos his own contemporaries;
and in 5. 80 supphes a practical illustration
of the force of the Argive claim

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">*karanos</foreign>), son or brother of Pheidon of
Argos, found the dynasty, to be succeeded

<title>Fab.</title> 219 (quoted in full by Nauck

romantic. Archelaos, a son of Temenos,
exiled by his brethren, took refuge in
Makedonia, and having won a victory
for the king, demanded his promised
reward (<foreign rend="ital">regnum et filiam</foreign>): the king,
however, sought his benefactor's life:
the plot was betrayed: Archelaos took
his would-be slayer in the pit prepared
for him: <foreign rend="ital">inde profugit ex responso

adopted by Euripides in compliment to
the reigning Archelaos, so the version

pedigree here given is doubtless official,

Alexander I., though the prominence of
the name Perdikkas might tempt one to
depress the genealogical essay to a
date after the accession of Perdikkas II.
The pedigree may, nevertheless, be
authentic, at least in its later members.
Alexander must have produced a pedigree
before he was admitted to compete
at Olympia (cp. my notes to 5. 22), not
later than 500 B.C. But the legendary
apotheosis of Perdikkas may be an afterthought;
or else Alexander gave his

indeed the whole letter. The offer
comprises six items: (i.) forgiveness, i.e.
no (further) penalties or reprisals against
Athens; (ii.) restoration of their land,
i.e. secure tenure; (iii.) additional
territory (at the expense of the Peloponnesians?);
(iv.) <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)tonomi/a</foreign>—no restoration
of tyrants; (v.) rebuilding of the
temples; (vi.) alliance (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(mologe/ein</foreign>: cp.

<p>Whether any such despatch had been
received by Mardonios or not is another
question. Up above he has been represented
as acting on his own initiative,
or by the advice of oracles. Again,
whether Alexander really delivered just
this (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta/de</lem></app>) speech, or anything like it,
is questionable. Baehr, while regarding
the mission of Alexander as historical,
says that the speeches, as reported, <foreign rend="ital">e

oracles were these which they now
recalled to mind? Blakesley detects
herein the oracles found by Kleomenes
in the Akropolis (in 511 B.C.) 5. 90, and
further suggests that they were fabrications
by Onomakritos (cp. 7. 6 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>).
But was such a prediction, as is here
reported, likely to have been formulated
so early as that? Or is the added motive,
based upon these supposed oracles, required
to account for the action of the
Lakedaimonians on this occasion?
Onomakritos may have been the author
of these <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/gia</foreign>, but, if so, their fabrication
was probably of later date, and they
were perhaps part of the artillery
brought to bear upon the Athenians to
procure their medism, not Lakedaimonian
reminiscences of discoveries
thirty years old.</p>
<p>In any case this prediction is precious:
prophecies fulfilled are sweet, but those
unfulfilled are sweeter, to the historian;
their authenticity is so much more
obvious. The unfulfilled prediction,
besides, makes room for some fulfilment
of prediction. The extreme precision
of the present instance raises it to the
level of a maxim of policy, cp. c. 62
<foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p>The expulsion of the Lakedaimonians
and all the other Dorians to boot from
the Peloponnesos by the Medes and
Athenians, i.e. the complete reversal of
the Dorian conquest and its effects, was
not a bad idea to conjure with, and has
rather a Themistoklean touch about it:
perhaps it was not an offer made by
Mardonios to attract the Athenians, but
a bogle devised in Athens to terrify the
Spartans. It might at least suggest
<pb n="584"/>
possibilities in the future: but what of
Argos as the king's best friend? 7.
150 ff. Perhaps the whole notion really
belongs to the later date, and the time
of Themistokles' medism. The patriotic
(i.e. Attic) aspects of that <foreign rend="ital">gran rifiuto</foreign>
were nevei allowed to emerge in the
Themistoklean legend; and Athenian
tradition was quite capable of ignoring
the true and original connexion of this

This assertion raises a slight chronological
difficulty: the scene is laid at
Athens in the winter or early spring of
479 B.C. How have the Athenians
already lost two harvests? Are they
the harvests of two years, or the
two harvests of one year? Presumably
the former: but if so, the years
being 480, 479 B.C., how had the
Athenians already lost the harvest
<pb n="586"/>
of 479? Had they failed to follow the
directions of Themistokles <foreign xml:lang="greek">spo/rou a)nakw=s
e)/xein</foreign> c. 109 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> and so lost a harvest
by anticipation? Or is not the expression
here really a slight anachronism,
the two harvests which the Athenians
ultimately lost, one in 480 B.C. by the
devastation of Xerxes, the other in 479
B.C. by the devastation of Mardonios,
having been ‘telescoped’ by the writer
(or his source) in the light of later
events, from the point of view of the
hypothetical orator? (The anachronism
remains the same if Archontic years are
understood; or, for that matter, Spartan.)

an obvious gnome, probably
much older than the ostensible
occasion, and perhaps even inherited
from ‘the age of the Despots.’ Not but
what tyrant at times would work not
with but against his fellow. ‘Birds of
a feather fly together,’ ‘thieves work in
pairs,’ etc. etc., were proverbs a little
hard on Alexander and Mardonios.
Alexander was not a ‘tyrant’ in the
proper sense (cp. c. 137 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and
Mardonios was not technically a ‘tyrant’
at all. The gnome might have worked
better, especially as illustrating the
co-operation of the tyranny and the
Mede, if applied to the Ionians on the
Ister (4. 137 f.), or Hippias at Sardes
(5. 96), or the Greek exiles in the train of
Xerxes (7. 6 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). The point here,
however, put forward is not primarily
the connexion of ‘medism’ and ‘tyranny,’
but the tendency of tyrant to stand by
tyrant against the Republics. The
Republics, Sparta herself, did not go
into this matter with clean hands: she
had worked for the restoration of
Hippias (5. 91), she would have accepted
the aid of Gelon upon conditions (7.
157 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), as she was afterwards glad to
accept the aid of Dionysios, or for that
matter of Persia itself. But there is a
certain amount of truth in the solidarity
of constitutional sentiment. All states
are forced from time to time into strange
<pb n="587"/>
or unnatural alliances by necessity or
interest: nor is identity of constitution
between neighbours any great security
for peace. Monarchy will war against
Monarchy, Republic against Republic,
for the sake of territory, or commerce,
or honour, or adventure, or existence,
and will seek or accept any alliance that
may serve its turn; but still all the
same one form of constitution has an
‘elective affinity’ for its like, and other
things being equal, tolerates or cooperates
with it more easily. A <title>Bundesstaat</title>
could never arise between states of
diverse constitution, and it may be
doubted whether diversely constituted
units can permanently maintain a

themselves to have received it in large

but the actual battles of the war go off
without much active interposition (c. 94
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> unique) from above: the great
gods of Themistokles were Persuasion

The constant recurrence to this &lt;*&gt;

bulked very largely in Athenian &lt;*&gt;ories
and may have deeply affected &lt;*&gt;eir feelings
at the time, cp. c. 143  <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> it
also supports a relatively early date for
the speech: after the glories of Periklean
Athens had more than restored the
works destroyed by the Mede, the sharp
edge of these feelings was abated. But
the further inference that the Persian
war was in any special sense a religious
war, or that the Persians were inflamed
by puritanical and iconoclastic zeal
against the idolatry of Hellas, is an
exaggeration; cp. c. 109 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta\

question whether the Persian incendiaries
or the Athenian restorers wrought the
more havoc on the old Akropolis and
its contents: the ancient wooden image
of Athena, still to be seen in the days of
Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 1.26.6">1. 26. 6</bibl>), had been transported
to Salamis (Plutarch <title>Themist.</title>
10) and so preserved. Cp. Frazer ii.
340 f.; Hitzig-Bluemner, note <foreign rend="ital">ad l.c.</foreign></p>
<p>It is tolerably certain that the actual
destruction by the Persiaus was exaggerated
afterwards: in any case, at the
ostensible date of this speech, their
work of destruction was not yet fully
accomplished; cp. 9. 13 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Blakesley
remarks that after the battle of Plataia
it became the popular view at Athens
that the war had been waged against
the Persians in revenge for the destruction
of Hellenic temples: it is a far cry
from the field of Plataia to the (fictitious)
oath, which according to Lykurgos (<foreign rend="ital">c.
Leocr.</foreign> 82) was taken by the collective
allies just before the battle of Plataia;
cp. 7. 132 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> But that the Athenian
legend was well under way in the generation
after the hattle is proved by this
very passage. (Cp. Plutarch <title>Perikl.</title>

units (Thessaliaus, Boiotians, Athenians,
Peloponnesians, Italiotes, Sikeliotes, etc.
etc.); divided politically into separate
and independent city-states innumerable;
yet all claiming and recognizing each
other as belonging to one communion,
one organic system, one people—Greeks,
as we say; Hellenes, as they preferred to
name themselves.</p>
<p>Non-Hellenic elements were not unknown,
or unrecognized, within the
Hellenic area. There were sects, or
strata, on the borders or even in the
midst of Hellas, whose character was
doubtful or even non-Hellenic, e.g. Aitolians,
Epirotes, Makedonians, Pelasgoi,
Leleges, Kaukones, etc. There were
perhaps foreign intruders (Phoenician,
etc.). There were more certainly survivals
from a pre-Hellenic population.
But these elements were in the main
overcome, absorbed, assimilated, expelled,
or reduced to insignificance, albeit their
presence must be reckoned with, partly
as enriching, partly as disturbing, the
ideal homogeneity of the Hellenic type.
The Hellenic name apparently originated
in Thessaly (Homer, <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.683"><title>Il.</title> 2. 683</bibl>, 9. 395),
and spread with the Achaians (or, less
probably, the Dorians) over the whole
aggregate (cp. J. B. Bury, ‘History of the
names Hellas, Hellenes,’ <title>J.H.S.</title> xv. (1895)
pp. 217 ff.). The Greek name, in itself
every bit as ancient and authentic,
originated in Italy as a collective name,
having been brought thither by the
Chalkidic colonies (cp. Busolt 1.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 198;
Ed. Meyer, <title>G.d.A.</title> ii. (1893) 302), or
more probably—as giving an earlier date
—from Epeiros and that neighbourhood
(Helbig in <title>Hermes</title> xi. (1876) 257); cp.
Aristot. <title>Meteor.</title> 1. 353 A <foreign xml:lang="greek">au(/th d)</foreign> (sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/maimon</lem></app>, ‘of one blood.’ The
expression here, this ‘note’ or ‘test’
of Hellenism, assumes the national
pedigree, which traced the four main
divisions of the Hellenic aggregate to
the three sons of Hellen, Aiolos, Doros
and Xuthos (through his sons Ion and
Achaios). This pedigree cannot be
much older than Hesiod, in whom it
first meets us (<title>Frag.</title> 25 = Rzach 7: an
entirely different ethnology rules in the
Homeric poems), but its existence is
implied in Herodotus (1. 56, 7. 94,
8. 44) and Thucydides (1. 3), and is
fully given (from the logographs, etc.)
in Strabo 383, 397, Apollodoros &lt;*&gt;.
7. 3. In point of fact this &lt;*&gt; or
test of Hellenism is but an e&lt;*&gt;ation,
in ethnological terms, of the historic
fact of nationality, and is not itself a
datum to start from, but a theorem to
be proved. For it plainly means, not
that in course of time by intermarriage
there was brought about such a fusion
in the aggregate that all Hellenes might
be regarded as related to one another
(in any case a highly disputable theorem):
but it means that there really was a
strict descent and genealogy in the
Hellenic stock,  <foreign rend="ital">ab initio.</foreign> The pedigree
in any case took little or no account of
women: the theory belongs to a strictly
‘patriarchal’ stage or type of culture.
A dominant raee, a dominant strain, and
that ultimately of ‘Aryan’ or ‘IndoEuropean’
origin, in the Hellenic
aggregate, is proved by the remaining
tests, and by the further one, the
physical type, of which Hdt. takes here
no specific account; but a veritable
fusion and confusion of races and stocks
probably underlies the Hellenic nationality.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(mo/glwsson</lem></app>,
‘of one tongue.’
Language, including literature, is undoubtedly
a strong mark of racial identity,
especially in the earlier stages
of a nation's evolution. The prevalence
of the Greek language (and its
purity) is perhaps the most remarkable
fact, and coefficient, in the Hellenic
communion. But language is in itself
by no means a certain test of nationality,
or of race, nor are those who
speak one and the same language to
be regarded as descendants of one and
the same stock (the eases of Latin, of
English, of Greek itself are evidential).
But the predominance of a language in
a given area proves ccrtain conclusions,
applicable to the case of the prevalence
of Greek in the Hellenic area. (i.) The
presence and prevalence (numerical, or
political, or both) of the people whose
language it is. Moreover, the relative
purity of the Greek language points to
the early and effective occupation of the
given area by Hellenic tribes or folks.
<pb n="592"/>
(ii.) Philology proves that the people
whose native language was Greek
belonged to the Indo-European (or Eurasian)
stock, an observation which makes
it certain that the Greeks themselves
were immigrants into the region which
became the theatre of Hellenic history.
There is some evidence, however, of the
persistence of non-Hellenic tongues
within the Hellenic area, e.g. Hdt. 1.
57, and the non-Hellenic inscriptions
(in Greek characters) found in Lemnos
and in Krete. Perhaps also the varieties
of Greek dialect may have been encouraged
by the presence of pre-Hellenic elements
in the population. The linguistic
frontier is tolerably well defined round
Greece proper: in the East, Karian is a
foreign language, c. 135 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> and the
same is true of the Asianic languages
generally. In the West the Epeirote
and Illyrian are non-Hellenic (in the
historic period), Thuc. 2. 68, 80, 81. In
the North the position of Makedonian
is rather doubtful, but though akin to
Greek, it differs by more than merely
dialectal variation, while Thrakian is
distinctly ‘barbarous.’ In the South
the Kretans of historic times speak
Greek, but the non-Hellenic tongue
survives in the east of the island (cp. 7.
171 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>).</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">qew=n i(dru/mata/ te koina\ kai\ qusi/ai</lem></app>,
‘common foundations, common sacrifices
to gods’—that is, a common religion:
common cults, a common theology. The
great national centres of religion, with
their cults, oracles, and festivals—Olympia,
Delphi, Dodona (perhaps Delos),
Eleusis—must be chiefly in the speaker's
(or writer's) mind: the theology is not expressly
mentioned, but may be assumed;
cp. 2. 53. Perhaps nothing would more
clearly show the genetic or non-primitive
character of the Hellenic national communion
than the history of Hellenic
religion. The Hellenic and pan-Hellenic
significance of Olympia and of Delphi
(to take the most conspicuous examples)
was comparatively recent. The panHellenic
<title>Agon</title> of Delphi has the year
585 B.C. as its epoch, and it was established
by Kleisthenes of Sikyon and
Solon of Athens (cp. J. B. Bury, <title>The
Nemean Odes of Pindar,</title> 1890, Appendix
D). The Olympian <title>Agon</title> was dated
conventionally two centuries earlier (776
B.C.), but this is a ‘prochronism’; the
founder of the <title>Agon</title> was Pheidon of
Argos, and the date of the foundation
was probably 668 B.C. (Ol. 28; cp. Hdt.
IV.-VI. i. 383, note to 6. 127). Delphi
gave up to mankind what was intended
for Hellenes; but the Hellenic character
of the Olympian <title>Agon</title> is attested by
two striking facts: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the title of the
stewards, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(ellanodi/kai</foreign>, which must be
associated with the establishment by
Pheidon (the same title was used at
Nemea). The adoption of this title
presupposes the extensive recognition
of ‘Hellenes,’ and ‘Hellas.’ (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The
inclusion of all Hellenes (2. 160) and
the exclusion of ‘barbarians’ (5. 22) in
the competition, which give it a truly
‘national’ character. But the common
theology (<foreign xml:lang="greek">qeoi\ koinoi/</foreign> 9. 90 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">qeoi\ oi(
*(ellh/nioi</foreign> 5. 49) carries back further than
the great festivals. There is apparent
in Greece, even in the historic period, a
wondrous variety of local cults and of
local myths; but there is also apparent
a large community of belief and worship:
of this community the Homero-Hesiodic
‘theology’ (including the <title>Hymns</title>) may
be taken as typical. This theology is,
indeed, comparatively late (cp. Hdt. 2.
53), but its middle and latest ages
imply a long past, a long process, a
genesis; and the systematization, the
general reception of the Homeric
Pantheon, imply a large common stock
of ideas and of practices, original or
acquired, which in turn implies a long
history, a long occnpation of the area,
over which this religious complex is
recognizable.</p></div>

<p>It is not the business of the speaker
in this passage to qualify or to correct
the extreme and enthusiastic assertion
of ‘the unity of Hellas’; but it is worth
while for us to observe that under each
of the four great tests, or factors, of
Hellenism here propounded, history has
significant exceptions and contrary instances
to notice. Blood, Dialect,
Religion, Ethos, were dividing lines in
Hellas, though space here precludes

thus to Sparta was almost suicidal. It
looks downright foolish in the light of
the sequel: not alone the <foreign xml:lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> of
Lykidas (9. 5), who was one Athenian,
but the formal declaration of Athenian
representatives in Sparta, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ti su/mmaxoi

appears to be used in a good sense, as in

as in 4. 157. Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> detects, indeed, a
politely satirical (<foreign rend="ital">hoflich honisch</foreign>) tone in
this speech, and finds in that tone, and in
the large scale on which the whole story
of the negotiations is narrated, evidence
for two conclusions: (i.) that it was committed
to writing at the beginning of
the Peloponnesian war (i.e. 431 B.C.),
and (ii.) that Hdt. takes sides with
Athens against her ungrateful foes. As
to the first point: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) it assumes (as is too
often assumed) that Sparta and Athens
quarrelled for the first time in 431 B.C.
As a matter of fact the direct feeling
between Sparta and Athens was probably
not so bitter in 431 B.C. as it had been
in 446 B.C. or in 461 B.C.; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) it ignores
the bearing of the Makedonian question.
The war in 431 B.C. was largely brought
about by Perdikkas, who seems to have
had a genuine and legitimate grievance
against Perikles and Athens (cp. Thuc.
1. 57). It would be a strange way of
taking sides with Athens at the outbreak
of the war in 431 B.C. to make
so much of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)/noia, eu)ergesi/ai, proceni/a,
fili/a</foreign> of Alexander of Makedon.
Possibly Hdt. sympathizes with Athens
rather than with Sparta in this passage,
but if so, it is an ideal sympathy, projected
into the situation of 479 B.C., not
an obscure and partisan commentary
upon the outbreak of hostilities in
431 B.C. The Atticizing tone of the
whole passage may be due to the Attic
or phil-Athenian sources, from which
Hdt. has drawn it. So far as Atticism
illuminates the problem of composition,
the passage is most easily intelligible
as belonging to the earlier, perhaps to
the earliest, draft of these Books. The
slight suspicion of persiflage is, perhaps,
misleading, for it ill accords with the
heroics of the immediate context. The
Spartan offer bore, indeed, rather too
near a resemblance to inviting a colossal
pledge, or hostage, from the Athenians;
but an Athenian migration to Sparta
had not been suggested; probably only
Peloponnesos was intended, and for that
move there was a precedent (cp. cc. 41

he spent the spring in efforts to win

would allow both occupations to the
same Archontic year. Stein brings
Mardonios to Athens “after the middle

“after the nuddle of September”), that
is, places the two events in different
Archontic years. Busolt ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 722 f. dates
the event to the second half of June (in

the man's patronymic or <title>Demotikon.</title>
The name Lykidas was, or became, very
rare in Athens; it occurs twice in
Demosthenes, (1) of a slave belonging
to Chabrias, (2) of a miller (cp. <title>Orat.
Att.,</title> Baiter and Sauppe, <title>Index</title> ii. 91).
The odd thing is that Demosthenes, <foreign rend="ital">de

important variations: (1) the traitor's
name is Kyrsilos, (2) the date is before
Salamis; cp. <bibl n="Cic. Off. 3.11.2">Cicero <foreign rend="ital">de Off.</foreign> 3. 11. 2</bibl>.
Thirlwall (ii. 363 n.) attempts to
harmonize by supposing Kyrsilos a
nickname of Lykidas; but Kyrsilos is
a good proper name; cp. Strabo, 530
(a Pharsalian), and <title>C.I.G.</title> ii. 2347 (a
Naxian). Moreover, the discrepancy of
date remains. Rawlinson reconciles the
two stories by accepting them both as
true! Grote (iv. 249 n.), while recognizing
the Herodotean as the more
probable of the two stories, shows
the improbability of both being true;
it would indeed be easier to believe
that they are both fictitious—an hypothesis
more creditable to the constitutional
morality of the Athenians and
the common humanity of their wives.

Schoemann - Lipsius ii. (1902) 473.
For the texts bearing upon the festival
see Wide, <title>Lakonische Kulte</title> (1893) 285 ff.
The feast was held during the Lakonian

Hekatombaion: perhaps = Thargelion,
reff. <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Busolt ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 722). The cult
implies a spring festival. The celebration
lasted three days: on the first day
the death of Hyakinthos was bewailed
(<bibl n="Paus. 3.19.3">Pausan. 3. 19. 3</bibl>); on another day the
women of Sparta brought a <title>Chiton</title> as an
offering to the god of Amyklai (<bibl n="Paus. 3.16.2">Pausan.
3. 16. 2</bibl>); on another day (Athenaeus
139 <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=| de\ me/sh| tw=n triw=n h(merw=n</foreign>—but,
if so, he omits to say what was done on
the third) there was a great and joyous
festival, with songs and dances, with
sacrifice and banquet: presumably in
honour of the apotheosis of Hyakinthos
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n qeo\n a)/|dousin</foreign>), whom by that time
it was very difficult to distinguish from
his destroyer (Apollon). (Rawlinson
seems to think the Hyakinthia lasted
only one day, and that Midsummer-day.)
<bibl n="Thuc. 5.23.4">Thucyd. 5. 23. 4</bibl> might favour an earlier

round Plataia, with battlements and
towers to boot, erected in 429 B.C. in the
course of the summer (Thuc. 2. 78, 3.

If they address the Ephors it is because
the question is not of alliance, of peace

mobilization, apparently a functron of
the Ephoralty; cp. Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 3. 2.

were the presidents both of the <title>Gerousia</title>

sometimes of the Ephors acting, where
they acted really with Senate or
Asseinbly; cp. Xenoph. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> Leotychidas,
by the way, would appear to have been
by this time at Aigina, or even Delos (8.

of Chileos are sadly belated; but placed
at a meeting either of the Spartan
Symmachy in the winter 480-79 or

as giving an Arkadian's view of the

Zech attempted to make out that

Nothing short of an eclipse (not necessarily

of Kleombrotos. Plutarch, <title>Caesar</title> 69,
uses <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)mau/rwma</foreign> similarly. Pctavius dated
this eclipse 2nd Oct. 480; Hoffmann and
Lamp <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Busolt ii.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 715 n. 1 agree in
the date, and time the maximum obscuration

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">prosaire/etai de\ e(wutw=|</lem></app>: there is
something very curious in this arrangement.
The Spartans will scarcely have
allowed the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(gemw/n</foreign> to select a colleague
at his own free will. Perhaps Pausanias
was barely of age to assume the great
responsibilities of his position, and an
older man, of the Herakleid lineage, was
associated with him in virtual command,
though nominally Pausanias had the
supreme honours; perhaps the great
victory, for which Pausanias claimed
(Thue. 1. 132. 2) and obtained (c. 64
<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) all the credit, was more due to
the intelligence of his cousin; if, indeed,
there was not a still greater intelligence
in the background. Cp. Appendix VIII.

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*eu)rua/nakta to\n *dwrie/os</lem></app> appears
again in ec. 53, 55; as Dorieus was the
eldest of the three brothers, Euryanax
was probably senior to Pausanias. Why
had he not succeeded Leonidas, or, for
that matter, Kleomenes, as son of the
next eldest son? Dorieus may have
renounced, or forfeited, the right of
succession; or a king's son (Leonidas,
Pleistarchos) may have succeeded in

<p>Rawlinson has an erroneous but very
instructive note on this passage. He
attempts to prove that the Dorieus here
mentioned cannot be Dorieus son of
Anaxandridas for two reasons: (1) Had
Dorieus left a son in Sparta “he would
undoubtedly have succeeded to the
throne”—but no! see above. (2) “The
words of Hdt. imply a more distant
relative.” Nay, the saddle is on the
wrong horse! Hdt. in Bks. 5 and 9
follows different sources; had he known
the story of Dorieus when he wrote this
passage he must have guarded his readers
against the error into which Rawlinson
has fallen; in other words, this passage
makes strongly for the <foreign rend="ital">earlier composition

comes with startling rapidity after
the ‘lynching of Lykidas’ in c. 4 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign>
and puts both the Athenians and the
Spartans in a very unfortunate and
probably false position. The notion
that the Peloponnesian forces were only
mobilized at the eleventh hour under
threat of ‘medism’ on the part of
Athens is highly improbable. (i.) If
Mardonios is in Attica, or even in
Boiotia, then in all probability a
Spartano-Peloponnesian force is already
at the Isthmos—if only to defend the
wall. (ii.) The threat here is entirely
subversive of the heroics in 8. 144, and
even in c. 7 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> (iii.) The more probable
date of the Hyakinthia, in spring,
militates against this <foreign rend="ital">ultimatum.</foreign> (iv.)
The subsequent relations of Athenians
and Spartans during the campaign are
against it. (v.) The ultimatum is in
itself an absurdity: the point at issue is
really one of detail, as to the exact
<foreign rend="ital">modus operandi;</foreign> the Athenians could
not doubt the substantial <foreign rend="ital">bona fides</foreign> of
the Spartans, with the king in command
of the fleet at Aigina. (vi.) The notion
is too comic that 5000 Hoplites and
35,000 Helots had mobilized and marched
without any of the Athenian, Plataian,
or Megarian envoys getting wind of it,
or having a single friend in Spart a
to inform them. Probably there was a
good deal of friction and misgiving
between Athens and Sparta during the
winter and spring after Salamis and
before Plataia: it cannot be said that

henceforward the canonized founder of
‘Oresteion’ (cp. Eurip. <title>Orest,</title> 1647,
<title>Electr</title> 1273). In reality Oresthasion
was the capital town or village of the
Oresthis (cp. Thuc. 4. 134, 1), itself a
portion of the Mainalia (<bibl n="Thuc. 5.64.3">Thuc. 5. 64. 3</bibl>;

(<bibl n="Paus. 8.44.2">Pausanias 8. 44. 2</bibl>), and quite off the
direct road from Sparta to the Isthmos
(via Tegea, Mantineia, etc.). Rawhnson
suggests that this roundabout route was
selected in order to effect a junction
with a contingent from the Lepreatis,
surely an unnecessary arrangement. Perhaps
all the forces from Sparta did not
take one and the same route: those that
started first may have been sent by the
longer road. Or could it be that they
took the longer way round to avoid the
Argives? Cp. next c. (In days of yore

according to this story the
Argives were pledged to Mardonios to
keep the Spartans at bay. If true, this
pledge implies previous negotiations
between the Persian and the Argives, of
which nothing further has transpired.
It was a very pretty plan, or a very
pretty commentary on a want of plan.
Had the Argives really been co-operating
with the Persian to that extent they
might have made it impossible for
Sparta to send 10,000 Hoplites and
40,000 Helots beyond the Isthmos.
Argos observed neutrality, perhaps a
neutrality benevolent towards the ‘barbarian’;
but Sparta must have been
well assured that a real neutrality
would be observed before she denuded
Lakonia of fighting men. A forgotten
chapter in Greek diplomacy might
have recorded the <foreign rend="ital">pourparlers</foreign> between
Athens, Argos and Sparta during the
winter, or spring, which convinced the
Greeks that they had no active hostility
to expect from Argos: Salamis made a
deeper impression upon Argos than upon
Thessaly and Boiotia, powers which took
their cue from the fiasco at Thermopylai.
The embassy, whose absurd and pitiful
record has just been given above, may
have been better employed in squaring
Argos than in denouncing Sparta.</p>

or even if the city-walls, would not
prove that the circuit was complete
in 480 B.C. or that a siege of Athens
was a military possibility; cp. further
Appendix VI. § 1.</p>
<p>Rawlinson well remarks that this
account of the destruction of Athens by
Mardonios is exaggerated; Thuc 1. 89.
3 leaves some of the houses (<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)ki/ai</foreign>)
standing, and even portions of the citywall
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou= peribo/lou braxe/a</foreign>). Pausanias
(1. 18. 1, 20. 2) mentions temples older
than the Persian war. Col. Leake
(<title>Athens and the Demi,</title> i. 12) points out
the great difficulties of such total destruction
as Hdt. asserts. More recent
excavations have shown that even on
the Akropolis a good deal was left
standing when the Persians departed.
Mardonios had neither time nor zeal
for such wholesale annihilation; it was
only a ‘Restoration’ that could make
away with the past so utterly! Cp. 8.

<div type="commline" n="11">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=nde ei(/neken</lem></app>. Hdt. surpasses himself,
and gives the miliary reasons for
the evacuation of Attica with the
precision of a professor of the <title>SachKritik!</title>
The reasons are three in
number, and admit of development.</p>
<p>(i.) The Persian's strength lay in his
cavalry; Boiotia was better adapted than
Attica to cavalry operations (Hdt. says
nothing of a great superiority in infantry).</p>
<p>(ii.)
Attica was difficult to evacnate
in case of defeat. The point is not
fully or very clearly put; but at any
rate Mardonios is not counting on success
as a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>(iii.) He wished to be nearer his base
in Thebes. The reason is not quite
clearly put; speaking generally it is
better to fight in your enemy's than in
your friend's territory. Mardonios,
however, was thinking of his commissariat,
and also perhaps of the loyalty,
or potential disloyalty, of Greece in his
rear; in case of defeat a position north
of Kithairon was better from this point
of view. Artabazos might never have
effected his masterly retreat (c. 89 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>)
if the great battle had been fought on
the Thriasian or even on the Athenian
plain The argument as a whole was
purely strategic, and Hdt. does well not
to ascribe to Mardonios the policy of
limiting the Persian frontier of the
Hellenic satrapy <foreign rend="ital">in posse</foreign> to the KithaironParnes
line (<foreign rend="ital">pace</foreign> G. B. Grundy, <title>Great

Plataia; but, if defeated in the Thriasian

<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/llhn</foreign> is relative to the previous message
of the Argives; <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/dromon</foreign> is a bit of
information which might or might not
have been reported to Mardonios, but
at any rate shows that the force at
Megara was not a <foreign rend="ital">tertium quid,</foreign> but a
portion of the <foreign rend="ital">levée en masse.</foreign> See,
however, App. Crit. Mardonios is next
credited with a wish, a plan, and an
attempt to catch or capture this force
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e(/loi</lem></app>, Homeric; cp. <cit><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.37"><title>Il.</title> 2. 37</bibl> <quote xml:lang="greek">*pria/mou

<foreign xml:lang="greek">pollou\s zwou/s</foreign>). To do so he returns
apparently on his tracks (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(postre/yas</lem></app>)
and leads his whole force against
Megara. Such conduet is inconsistent
with his deliberate intention to withdraw
into Boiotia, for the good and
sufficient reasons set forth in the
previous chapter. Possibly Mardonios
fought a ‘rear-guard action,’ or sought
to retard the advance of the Peloponnesians,
while he evacuated Attica. He
could not view with equanimity the
penetration of Boiotia by the Peloponnesian
army (<foreign rend="ital">via</foreign> Dryoskephalai) before
he had evacuated Attica, even though
Thebes was probably held, and held
strongly, by a Persian (or Makedonian)
garrison; nor did he desire to fight the
great battle in Attica at all. His cavalry,
or a few squadrons of cavalry, employed
in harrying the Megarid, doubtless
retired either by Dryoskephalai or even
<pb n="616"/>
by Aigosthena into Boiotia, while the
main column marched by the eastern
pass or passes; see next chapter.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="5">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)pi\ ta\ *me/gara</lem></app>: apparently Megara,
unlike Athens, was fully fortified, and
strongly held. No previous attack upon
it has been mentioned; and the Megarid
had escaped a Persian visitation in the
previous year, improbable as such immunity
may in itself appear, cp. 8. 70.
The loss of Megara was treated by
Themistokles, 8. 60, as the certain consequence
of the evacuation of Salamis:
<foreign rend="ital">per contra,</foreign> the victory at Salamis may
have saved the city. Even now only
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">xw/ra</foreign> suffers. That would practically
be the plain lying between the Kerata,
Geraneia, and the two seas. The city
itself possessed two citadels (<bibl n="Paus. 1.39.5">Pausan. 1.
39. 5</bibl>, 42. 1): hence perhaps the plural
form of the name.</p></div>

“This was the <foreign rend="ital">furthest</foreign> point [not ‘the
<foreign rend="ital">westernmost</foreign>’] of Europe, looking westward,
which was reached” (by this army
of Persians), Blakesley. “This was the
furthest land in Europe towards the
sun-setting to which this Persian army
came,” Macaulay. Blakesley is no doubt
right in saying that the emphasis is not
on the exact orientation, but on the
distance; nevertheless the orientation
is given, and involves Hdt., or his
cartographer, unwittingly in error. Hdt.
evidently conceives of Central Greece as
running approximately north and south
(cf. his orientation of Thermopylai 7.
176). It did not occur to him, when he
wrote this passage, that not merely was
Delphi (visited <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> by the
Persians, 8. 35) far to the west of the
Megarid, but that the whole route of
the Persian forces in Central Greece,
Mardonios' march from Thessaly in this
very spring, had lain west of the point
here marked as the furthest point of
Europe in the west reached by the
Persian arms. The orientation, then,
breaks down equally whether Hdt.
meant by the words <foreign xml:lang="greek">au(/th stratih/</foreign> the
army (cp. 6. 12 where it is used absolutely
for <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezo\s strato/s</foreign>) of Xerxes or the
army of Mardonios; and this passage
evidently belongs to a <foreign rend="ital">composition to be
dated before Hdt.'s own visit to Europe,</foreign>
to Delphi, Thebes and Central Greece,
and was left standing, perhaps by oversight,
after he must have known better
(perhaps like the Thermopylai orientation).
Cp. Introduction, § 9. Hdt.
certainly did not mean that another
Persian army had penetrated further,
i.e. further westwards, into Europe;
but he may have had in his mind the
possibilities that other Persian armies
had penetrated further into Europe, to
wit, northward, or north-eastwards
(having regard to his conception of the
continent); and he probably has no
special intention of distinguishing here
the army of Mardonios from the army
of Xerxes.</p></div></div>

These officers, or some of them, were
now in attendance on Mardonios, as
they ‘sent for’ men from the Asopos
valley to act as guides (Athenians were
either not to be found, or not to be

apparently not with Mardonios). Guides
might have been needlul on the Phylel'anakton

(to wit, the men of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*skw=los, *:etewno/s,
*)eruqrai/, *(usiai/</foreign>) as subject to Thebes;
in that sense, when Mardonios turned
(if he did turn) up the river, and recrossed
it to Skolos, he would there be <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n gh=| th=|
*qhbai/wn</foreign>. Hdt., however, does not keep
him long at Skolos, but passes him on
to the camp or <title>Laager</title> described below,
which was not at Skolos, nor even on
the same side of the river as Skolos.
Possibly there is some error&lt;*&gt; confusion
in the account of the reti&lt;*&gt;nent of Mardonios
from Attica; or rather, is it
possible there should not be? Hdt.
apparently assumes that Mardonios takes
all his forces into Attica—not a probable
assumption—and that Mardonios takes
them all in, and all out, by one route,
and one route only—a still less probable
assumption (cp. 8. 113). Skolos evidently
lies at the Boiotian end of the middle or
direct route from Athens to Thebes. If
Mardonios found himself at Skolos it was
probably because he himself came out
of Attica by this route. More than one,
perhaps all three routes out of Attica,
may have been used—not to say the
route by Aigosthena from Megara, c.
14  <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> That the ‘Asopioi’ acted as
guides favours this suggestion. If Mardonios
himself came by the easier route
from Dekeleia to Tanagra, he probably
went on to Thebes, or else to the Laager,
by the left bank. The only diarial hint
for the march is the night spent in
Tanagra, and the next day. Probably
nights were also spent at Dekeleia (12
miles from Athens), at Sphendale (7-8
miles from Dekeleia), as well as at Tanagra
(11-12 miles from Sphendale). (Skolos
would be about 9 miles up the Asopos.)</p></div>

‘posted’ if <foreign xml:lang="greek">tetagme/non</foreign> be retained) along
the Asopos river. The fortified part
of it was of less extensive construction,
being about ten stades to each front.’</p>
<p>This passage makes it clear that the
Laager was much larger than the fortified
<title>Praetorium,</title> and that the fortified
portion had a measurement of upwards
of a square mile; but the exact size
<pb n="619"/>
and appearance of the camp are not
described, and a large number of other
problems are left unresolved.</p>
<p>(1) Was the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tei=xos</foreign> square? Hdt. may
perhaps mean this, for otherwise he
should have given the measurements of
the other sides, or flanks; and <foreign rend="ital">prima
facie</foreign> each side of a fort is a <foreign xml:lang="greek">me/twpon</foreign>.
Elsewhere in similar cases he is more
particular to specify quadrature, e.g. of
Babylon, 1. 178 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ou=sa me/twpon e)/kaston

e)ou/shs tet ragw/nou</foreign>.</p>
<p>(2) Was the Laager on one side, or
on both sides the Asopos; and in what
part of the Laager was the Fort? The
Fort was on the left bank of the Asopos,
for the Persians cross the river to reach
the Greeks c. 59 <foreign rend="ital">infra;</foreign> and the wooden
Fort is <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n moi/rh| th=| *qhbai(/di</foreign>, c. 65 <foreign rend="ital">infra
u.v.;</foreign> but cp. l. 6 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> places
the Fort south of Asopos in the neighbourhood
of Skolos, but Skolos has
nothing to say to the camp as described
by Hdt. nor to the battle; the mention
of Skolos above is to be otherwise
accounted for. Probably the fortified
camp was close to the river, and to the
bridge across the Asopos, the <foreign rend="ital">tête du pont</foreign>
on the south side being no doubt strongly
fortified and held; the rest of the Persian
lines would lie behind, and away from
the river, and no part of the Laager
proper would be on the right bank of
the river. The main road to Thebes
will have passed through the camp,
possibly dividing it in half; the 10
stades may be the measurement of the
river front, which was all palisaded;
the palisading probably went all round
the ‘Fort,’ and the Fort may have been
square.</p>
<p>(3) It is quite certain that no part of
Mardonios' Laager or Fort actually
touched the towns of Erythrai and
Hysiai, for these places are presently
in possession of the Greeks cc. 19, 25
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> The description here given of
the extent of the Persian camp must
be understood either (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) to be based upon
a report of the appearance of the Persian
camp as seen from the Greek lines above,
which enclosed Erythrai, and afterwards
Hysiai; or (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) to mean that the Laager
(though north of Asopos) occupied ground
belonging to the two townships named,
and extended further into Plataian territory
north of Asopos. But for two reasons
the former explanation is to be preferred:
(1) the contrast here between the names
of the towns and the specification of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*plataii\s gh=</foreign>: (2) the doubt whether the
territory of Erythrai and Hysiai did
extend to the further bank of the stream,
which was probably all Theban. The
first reason may be further enforced by
the supposition that the name of Plataiai
is avoided because Plataiai was in ruins;
the second, by the observation that the
Thebans had only been driven across
the Asopos by the Athenians in or about
509 B.C., the river being then made the
frontier between the Thebais on the one
side and the Plataiis and Hysiatis on
the other; 6 108 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p></div>

The ‘banquet of Attaginos’ was apparently
eelebrated, and a part of general
tradition; Hdt. has, however, a partieular
anecdote to relate about it, which he
owes to a special source of information—
a source full of possibilities! Probably
the general report in regard to the
banquet was very different from the
pessimism of this anecdote, which Hdt.
had apparently heard not once, but
again and again (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/kouon</foreign>, cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/kousa</foreign> 7. 55).</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*qersa/ndrou <gap/> *)orxomeni/ou</lem></app>. Why
does not Hdt. give a patronymic to this
prinee of Orehomenos? Thersandros
occurs as the name of the son of Polyneikes
4. 147, 6. 52. The Orehomenos
here named is of course the Boiotian;
cp. 8. 34. (On the coinage the all but
constant form of the name is Erchomenos;
cp. Head, <title>H.N.</title> 294 and c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>)
Had this Orehomenian paid for his
medism with exile? Had Hdt. as a boy
heard the story from the exile's lips?
Where or when had they met? Perhaps
in Hdt.'s own Halikainassian home.
The Orchomenian will not have been
quite a young man in 479 B.C., and there
is not the slightest necessity to delay
the intereourse between Thersandros and
Hdt. until the latter's visit to Boiotia (of
which we have conclusive evidence in 5.
59): the imperfect <foreign xml:lang="greek">h/kouon</foreign> also militates
<pb n="621"/>
against that. Thersandros is memorable
as one of the three men whom Hdt. actually
names among his informants (cp. 3.
55, 4. 76—the scribe at Sais is anonymous
2. 28). The pseudo-antithesi, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ndro\s me\n
*)orxomeni/ou, logi/mou de\ e)n *)orxomenw=|</foreign> is
curious; or, perhaps, in contrast to his
position as an exile in Asia: otherwise
it were a stylistic infelicity. Was
the exilc of Orchomenos reduced to
keeping a school, like <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dionu/sios e)n

This Persian not only speaks good Greek
but has drunk deeply—at the wells of
Greek wisdom. In a less pious expression
the same fatalism appeals to Amasis
as the moral of the story of Polykrates'
Ring, 3. 43; in a still higher region it
rules the gods themselves, as the Pythia
informed Kroisos 1. 91 <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n peprwme/nhn
moi=ran a)du/nata e)sti\ a)pofugei=n kai\ qew=|</foreign>.
There is no such pessimistic quietism
on the Achaimenid monuments, which
breathe glad confidence in the patronage
and providence of Ahura-mazda (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou=
qeou=</foreign>); but it must be admitted that
Mazdeism sought to overcome its inherent
dualism by tracing Good and
Evil to a common Antecedent, Space,
Time, Fate, or such-like. Such monism
existed in the fourth century, if not
in the fifth; though if Darmesteter be
right, no direct trace of such a system is
to be found in the <title>Avesta</title> (cp. <title>Sacred Bks.
of the East,</title> IV. p. lxxxii.). But surely
fatalism as a belief, or sentiment, the
recognition of the unappeasable Power
behind the benignant Person, is not the
special product of any nation, or of any
creed, but <foreign rend="ital">allgemein menschlich.</foreign> It is
less Hebraic than Hellenic, less Persian
than Anglian. Boiotian Hesiod and
Wessex Hardy are as deeply tinged
therewith as Eeelesiastes or Omar Khayyam;
and the Greek are here the older
sources. Cp. 5. 4 with my notes <foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign></p></div>

not so much the pious generalization,
which has immediately preceded, as
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the approaching destruction of the
army, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the uselessness of addressing
Mardonios and those in authority. This
aneedote may perhaps be taken for
evidence that a Persian victory was by
no means regarded in the Persian camp
as a foregone conclusion; many other
hints point to the same inference: (1)
<pb n="623"/>
the advice of the Thebans, c. 2 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign>

which ‘the Lakedaimonians’ reached the

The 5000 ‘Spartiates’ have

<title>Perioikoi</title> in c. 11; these forces are under

Mardonios decided and began to evacuate
Attica (<foreign xml:lang="greek">pri(n h)\ tou\s meta\ *pausani/ew e)s

1000 ‘Lakedaimonians,’ apparently an
advanced guard, at Megara is recorded
<pb n="627"/>
in c. 14, and Mardonios is apparently
still in Attica; in c. 15 intelligence
reaches Mardonios that <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(le/es ei)/hsan oi(

he finally clear out of Attica. <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( *(/ellhnes</foreign>

of <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( loipoi\ *peloponnh/sioi toi=si ta\ a)mei/nw

is recorded here immediately below.
The position of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/dromos stratih/,
*lakedaimoni/wn xi/lioi</foreign> (c. 14) at Megara is
a little obscure; but there is a moment
apparently before Mardonios has evacuated
Attica when 1000 Lakedaimonians
are in Megara, and some 9000-10,000
at the Isthmos, or on the way thither,
to say nothing of the Helots. At the
Isthmos they are joined by the rest of
the confederate forces from Peloponnese,
but only after Mardonios has heard of
this mobilization and concentration does
he evacuate Attica; and only after he
has evacuated Attica do the confederate
forces advance to Eleusis. It is just
conceivable that the arrival of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/dromos
stratih/</foreign> in Megara is not quite
correctly chronologized in c. 14, and that
it was not separated by so large an
interval as is there implied from the
advance of the confederate forces from
the Isthmos to Eleusis. Probably the
last of the Persian cavalry had ridden
down the northern slopcs of Kithairon,
and the construction of the camp on the
Asopos was reported at Eleusis, before
the sacrifices proved favourable to an
advance into Boiotia.</p></div>

there were the Athenians to be considered.

<p>Is it at all likely that the Peloponnesians

on the Thriasian plain (as Stein suggests)?
The Athenians in Salamis, to say nothing
of their own <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro/dromoi</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(merosko/poi</foreign>,
will have kept them better informed
than that. It appears, on the contrary,

certainly marks a new departure in the

attempted on land since the fiasco at
Thermopylai; and the Persians might
have been holding the pass. No doubt
the junction with the Athenians is the
decisive factor, and the Athenians are the
driving force, in the advance into Boiotia.
The advance to Eleusis was not definitely
what the move into Boiotia is, a resumption
of the offensive: perhaps at the
same time the fleet leaves Salamis for
Aigina, or Aigina for Delos, not to say
Delos for Ionia.</p>
<p>Erythrai has been given, c. 15 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign>
as the <foreign rend="ital">terminus a quo</foreign> for the construction
or measurement of the Persian
<foreign xml:lang="greek">strato/pedon</foreign>. If the Persians were really
at Erythrai, the Greeks could not have
arrived there without first clearing the
Persians out: that would have entailed
a fight. Stem says there must here be
a gap in Hdt.'s narrative. The Hellenes
must have forced the pass of Eleutherai,
and driven the enemy eastward on to
the fortified camp at Skolos, and north,
into the plain. But is that convincing?
The forcing of the pass of EleutheraiErythrai,
i.e. Dryoskephalai, would
have been a colossal affair; imagine its
&lt;*&gt;ving made not the faintest impression
upon the traditions of the Persian war!
The holding of the pass would not have
been good strategy on Mardonios' part,
nor in accord with his general plan, as
given &lt;*&gt; c. 13  <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Moreover, as
above shown, the fortified camp was not
at Skolos, and had it been so, the sight
presented to the Greeks, when they
took up their quarters at Erythrai, would
not have been that described in this
chapter. Finally, Erythrai was not included
in the Persian lines, cp. notes to
c. 15 above.</p>
<p>The position of Erythrai has been
determined by G. B. Grundy against
Leake, cp. <title>The Great Persian War</title>
(1901) pp. 458 ff. It is on the higher
ground, above <title>Kriekouki,</title> in the gorge
through which issued the direct road
from Eleutherai to Thebes: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ th=s

alternative is to be preferred, but not to
the extent of putting the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tei=xos</foreign> far
away to the east, on the S. side of the
river, at Skolos. The object of Mardonios
was to bring the Greeks down on to the

at least he would probably retain at
least the <foreign rend="ital">tête du pont</foreign> on the Erythraian

Hdt. apparently treats the Megarians
as occupying a post in line with the
rest of the forces, which by this time,
according to him, are perhaps drawn up,
or drawing up, along the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> of
Kithairon; but he is not explicit upon
the point, and gives no account of
the respective positions of the various
contingents. <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)nteta/ssonto</lem></app> above may
well be an imperfect of the veriest type
(‘were falling into line,’ or ‘were taking
up positions’). Hdt. first describes the
line formation of the Greeks for the
second position below, when there is
even a dispute over a question of precedence,
which must have been settled
for the first position, if in the first
position the Greeks were in line formation.
I therefore suggest that in this
first position the Greeks were still in
column, emerging down the pass, headed
by the Megarians (and Athenians?),
who were to hold Erythrai and the roadway,
which it commanded, while the
remainder of the forces deployed from
behind them only or mainly to the left,
so as to take up positions <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ th=s u(pwre/hs
tou= *kiqairw=nos</foreign>, the Spartans to the
right (but cp. 1. 12 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), the Athenians
to the left, towards Hysiai and Plataia.
This development may or may not have
been finally accomplished; meanwhile
Mardonios attacks the head of the
column as it emerges from the pass.
(Perhaps, if the Athenians headed the
column, they had already deployed on
to the ground to the left.) He seems
to have struck a little too soon, though
not, perhaps, until convinced that the
Greeks were not coming down into the
plain. How it happened that ‘the
Megarians,’ 3000 strong, were at the
head of the column, if that was their
position, who can say? Possibly the
Lakedaimonian <foreign xml:lang="greek">xi/lioi</foreign> (c. 14 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) were
still with them, though the strongly
‘atticizing’ tradition forgets them; they
may have headed the column from
Megara to Eleusis, and so onwards; or
they may even have come across Kithairon
by the direct route from Megara, and so
arrived at the head of the forces, while
the Athenians may have led the column
from Eleusis by Eleutherai. Of course
there was no accident in the matter;
all had been arranged.</p>

The first brush with the Barbarians is
presented as a forlorn hope, calling
for valiant volunteers; Thermopylai is
forgotten, or only remembered to be
eclipsed; instead of sending forward
some of his own men, out of his 10,000
hoplites and 40,000 light-armed, Pausanias
asks for volunteers; and Athenians,
a bare 300, step lightly forward into the
breach: it is enough!—300 Athenians
save the situation at Erythrai; 300
Spartans at Thermopylai could only
die! Probably the Athenians were next
to the Megarians, whether in the column
or in the line, and were ordered forwards
as a matter of course, especially as they
had a corps of archers. The Megarians
<pb n="632"/>
(with the 1000 Spartans perhaps) presumably
remained at their post; even
among the Athenians, it was probably
not the 300 hoplites but the archers—
‘perhaps 3000 in number’ (Rawlinson)—
who kept the Persian cavalry at bay;
meanwhile the rest of the Greek column
was passing forward, behind Erythrai,
westwards towards Hysiai and Plataia,
dcploying to the left. When this
manœuvre was accomplished, the
Athenians, Megarians (and Lakedaimonian
Chiliad?) might be on the
extreme right of the Greek line, and
the Lakedaimonian main body on the
extreme left, towards Plataia.</p></div>

shows that it was done by Greeks, and
it is recorded in the case of the death
of Pelopidas (Plutarch <title>Pelop.</title> 33), but
perhaps the higher culture tended to
discountenanee it. Aischylos in the

‘barbarous,’ like Hdt.; and Alexander

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">prw=ta me\n <gap/> para\ ta\s ta/cis

imply (1) that there was a road along
whieh the wagon was drawn by horses
(oxen, or mules); (2) that the Greek
army was posted in tactical array of
some kind. Only one of two roads can
well be in question: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the road from
Erythrai past Hysiai to Plataia; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the
road up the Pass to Eleutherai, etc. If
the Greek army was already in extended
formation, in lines running east and
west, as is apparently assumed by
Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title> 11 <foreign rend="ital">ad init.,</foreign> and
universally assumed for ‘the first
position’ by modern authorities, the
Megarians and Athenians would apparently
occupy the extreme right wing,
and the rest of the army would be to
the left of them towards Hysiai and
Plataia; or else the Athenians are already
on the left wing, the rest of the forees
having debouehed to the right of them.
Two considerations appear to me to
favour the former supposition:—(i.) Had
the Athenians already been in oecupation
of the left wing, the question so
hotly disputed in the next chapter could
hardly have arisen at that point. (ii.)
Strategieally and tactieally the debouchure
of the army towards the west is
the natural one. If Erythrai was at
the foot, or near the foot of the pass,
the Greek van would seize on that
position, and hold it, while the rest
of the army moved from behind out of
the pass. There is hardly room for such
a development towards the east side,
where the pass is flanked by the great
mass of rock named by Dr. Grundy
‘The High Bastions’; moreover, such
a movement would have thrown the
Greek front away to the east of the
Persian encampment, down stream,
exposing them to be outflanked (on
their left) by the Persian cavalry.
Again, the development of the Greek
first position westwards accords with
the subsequent movement reported in
this chapter, and also places the rear of
the column, when developed, in front
of the two other roads, or passes, crossing
Kithairon (to Eleutherai and to
<pb n="637"/>
Megara). Finally, as, upon the above
supposition, the Lakedaimonians in the
first position come to stand on the
extreme left, and the Athenians ou the
right, not only is there some excuse for
the coutroversy in the next chapter,
when the army moves down-hill to
‘the second position,’ but also a clue
is perhaps found to the real or recorded
exchange of positions between the
Athenians aud the Lakedaimonians in
the second position (cc. 46, 47 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>),
though for that exchange, or supposed
exchange, other fair explanations may
also be forthcoming. It is possible,
then, that the body of Masistios was
conveyed upon a wagon along the road
running from Erythrai towards Plataia,
no doubt mostly behind the Greek lines,
as finally developed in ‘the first position.’
It is also, however, possible that
the wagon was taken simply up the road
through the pass to the rear, the sight
of it mightily encouraging the rear
ranks of the column, which had not yet
fully emerged on to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>. What
the ultimate destination of the wagon,
or what became of the corpse, Hdt.
unfortunately does not inform us;
presumably he did not know. The

writes as though he had seen it; but

Artachaies at Akanthos, 7. 117, or Philip
of Kroton at Segesta, 5. 47. Cp. c. 20

this is a formal decision of the
council of war, cp. c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> or of
the commander-in-chief. That it was
taken at this moment may not be
strictly correct. Hdt. does not say for
how long the Greeks occupied ‘the first
position,’ whether for days, or only for
hours. The process by which the advance
was effected may have been as
follows:—The Megarians (or perhaps <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(
a)mfi\ *megare/as ktl.</foreign>, cp. c. 69) had
seized and occupied Erythrai, until relieved
by the Athenians, who in their
turn have been supported by more and
more of the forces, until <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( pezo\s a(/pas</foreign> has
gradually arrived on the scene. The
Athenians and Megarians may have
moved out of Erythrai, westwards towards
Hysiai first, and then beyond,
Erythrai being occupied in succession
by the various contingents, without
further fighting, and the position being
constantly developed westwards, until
finally the Athenians and Megarians
have pushed along the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> far
enough to the west to allow of the
Lakedaimoniaus in the rear occupying
Erythrai on the extreme right of the
position. If this was the process, then
the question of precedence between the
Atheuians and Tegeatai was virtually
settled beforehand. But it seems more
probable that, as above suggested, the
head of the column, composed of the
Megarians (and the Spartan Chiliad?)
supported by the Athenians continued to
hold Erythrai, while the rest of the
army deployed behind Erythrai to the
west, along the high ground, in front
of Hysiai and towards Plataia. This
movement would be facilitated by the
<pb n="638"/>
existence of the roads from Erythrai to
Plataia, and from Dryoskephalai to
Plataia.</p></div>

merely a northerly, but a north-westerly
direction; that it was not due west, or

with a view to pure fighting
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)mmaxe/sasqai</foreign> c. 7 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) which must
have been under consideration. If the
Greeks did not want to provoke a battle
they would have remained in their first
position, or moved at once to the
‘Islaud’ (c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>). The fact that
the battle was not finally fought exactly
in the second position has, perhaps, led
to the ‘offensive’ or at least provocative
character of this forward movement being
ignored. Any one could appreciate the
reason given, which was manifest to the

before the new position was occupied,

was to be effected, i.e. the existing
arrangement and order of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/ceis</foreign> was
to be modified, or at any rate the army
was to be put in battle-array; it had
not therefore previously been in battlearray,
but in marching order, or at least
not in the order of battle approved by
the commanders. (Cp. 8. 70 <foreign xml:lang="greek">parekri/qhsan

the Thebans circumvented the Plataians

<pb n="639"/>
plainly west of Erythrai and east of
Plataia; cp. c. 15 <foreign rend="ital">supra ad f.;</foreign> but
whether Hysiai was higher up hill, or
on lower ground than Erythrai, is not
s&lt;*&gt; evident. Tradition (cp. G. B. Grundy,

<title>G.P.W.</title> p. 464) identifies the site with
that of the existing village of <title>Kriekouki:</title>
Dr. Grundy himself places it outside the
area of the existing village, and higher
up the hill to the south. I think it
probable that just as Erythrai commanded
the Dryoskephalai Pass, and the
direct road from Thebes to EleutheraiEleusis
- Athens, so Hysiai commanded
the loop-road from Plataia which struck
into the main road behind the ridge, by
a second pass; while Plataia itself might
be taken to command the third road and
pass across the ridge of Kithairon, that
leading direct to Megara. These three
passes cross the ridge at intervals of
about a mile (roughly); but Plataia lay
somewhat further in advance (and to the
west) of Pass III. than Hysiai and Erythrai
of Passes II. and I. respectively.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)s th\n *plataii/da gh=n</lem></app>. The territory
of Plataia extended northwards
right down to the Asopos (cp. c. 15
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); how far it extended eastwards
is uot so clear. Hysiai (Strabo 404) and
Erythrai (Strabo 409) were both in the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*paraswpi/a</foreign>, and their territories (whether
independent or not) reached down to the
river - course. It may be conjectured
that the whole water - system of the
Oeroe (c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) belonged to Plataia,
while lower down, and to the north,
stream A. 4 among the tributaries of
the Asopos, descending from Kithairon,
may have formed a boundary between
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*plataii/s</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(usiaii/s</foreign>. This
would place Gargaphia, on every theory,
within the <title>Plataiis,</title> as also the Heroon
of Androkrates; it would leave the
Demetrion (c. 62 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) and the ‘Long
Ridge’ in the <title>Hysiaiis.</title> The boundary
between the territory of Hysiai and that
of Erythrai might perhaps be found in
the considerable stream A. 6 which Dr.
Grundy conjecturally identifies with the
Moloeis (c. 57 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>) This identification
would suit the position suggested above,
on the Plataia-Athens pass, for the site
of Hysiai very well, and would lead to
the inclusion of the Argiopion (e. 57

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)piko/menoi de\ e)ta/ssonto kata\

(1) Were not the Greeks already
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tetagme/noi kat' e)/qnea</foreign>? Most certainly,
the various <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/ceis</foreign>, the various contingents
in the first position, Megarians, Athenians,

all arrive at the uew position and then
proceed to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/tacis</foreign>? Such an operation
is practically incredible. The order
in which the ethnie <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/ceis</foreign> should stand,
or laager, in the new (i.e. ‘second,’ or more
strictly third) position must have been
determined, in the main, before the
position was occupied; the Greeks could
neither have arrived there in a confused
mass, with all the various <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/qnh</foreign> indiscriminately
mixed up, as though the
proceeding were a pêle-mêle flight, not a
forward movement in the face of the
enemy; nor, again, could the various
ethnie coutingents, each in itself compact,
have advanced and taken up a
station at random round the fouutaiu
of Gargaphia. Whatever the order in
which the Greeks had bivonacked iu the
first position, by Erythrai (or in the
second positiou, west thereof), the order
of battle, and the order of the stations
in the Asopos position, must have been
decided before the forces moved forward
to occupy it. But if, as above suggested,
the Athenians, in the final development
of the first position, occnpied the extreme
right, at Erythrai, while the Tegeatai
were ou the left, next the Spartans,
there might be a question whether, when
the Spartans moved forward to the right,
the Tegeatai should follow them, or
simply move forward into position so
as to form the extreme left of the Greek
line in ‘the secoud (i.e. third) position.’</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">plhsi/on th=s te krh/nhs th=s *gargafi/hs</lem></app>:
the position and ideutity of
Gargaphia have been disputed.</p>
<p>(i.) It was identified by Squire (<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Walpole, <title>Memoirs,</title> 338 ff.) aud by Clarke
(<title>Travels,</title> ii. 3, p. 83) with the spring
now called <title>Vergutiani.</title> Blakesley unfortunately
acquiesced in this identification,
which is quite hopeless, Vergutiani
beiug high up on the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>, and
belonging to the water-system of the
Oeroe. (The apparent ‘second’ position
of the Greeks is described below, e. 30,
as <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=| *)aswpw=|</foreign>. Perhaps in the true
second position Vergutiani was within,
or just behind, their lines.)</p>
<p>(ii.) Leake (<title>N.G.</title> ii. 332, 343) and
Vischer (<title>Erinnerungen,</title> p. 549) accept
the traditional identification of Gargaphia
with a spring now known as <title>Apotripi,</title>
<pb n="640"/>
just north of and below the (ruined)
Church of St. John on the ‘Asopos
Ridge’: the head-waters in fact of
stream A. 1 in G. B. Grundy's Maps.
This identification is <foreign rend="ital">prima facie</foreign> valid.</p>
<p>(iii.) Grote (followed by Rawlinson
and Stein) regarded Gargaphia as nonexistent
at the present day, or, what
comes to the same thing, unidentifiable.
Grote unfortunately never visited the
scenes with which his great work is
concerned. No one who has actually
seen the battle field of Plataia, or
considered its problems <foreign rend="ital">in loco,</foreign> will
easily acqniesce in this <foreign rend="ital">non possumus.</foreign></p>
<p>(iv.) Dr. G. B. Gruudy identifies the
spring of Gargaphia with an extant
spring some three-quarters of a mile, or
less, east (slightly by north) of Apotripi,
and virtually in the same hollow ground,
or trough, as Apotripi, surrounding the
Asopos Ridge. This spring is one of
the head - waters of the stream A. 4
forming the east boundary of the Asopos
Ridge, and possibly, as above suggested,
the frontier between the Plataiis and
the Hysiaiis. Not much is gained by
this shift of Gargaphia one-half to threequarters
of a mile eastward: as a matter
of fact both springs in question will
have been within the Greek lines; but
Dr. Grundy's suggestion tends to put
the spring on the extreme right of the
Greek army, which might appear an
advantage, especially to those who take
Gargaphia and the Androkrateion as
making two termini; see next note.</p>
<p>Hdt. himself makes Gargaphia 10
stades from the Island, c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign> and
20 stades from the Heraion, c. 52 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign>
These measurements are obviously mere
round numbers, and of very little value
except as making (i.) <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> more than
ever impossible. The distance to the
‘Island’ (as identified by Dr. Grundy)
would suit either spring; the distance
to the Heraion (whatever its exact site)
is in either case an over-estimate. If the
Island had been where Leake and Vischer

Thucydides goes, the Heroon is anywhere,
within reach, on the right of the
road from Plataia to Thebes. There is
no evideuce that Thucydides himself
ever visited Plataia, and the ‘5 or 6
stades’ mentioned in the context need
not be used to prejudice the position of
the Hero's house. Little is known of
Androkrates, but he was plainly the
greatest of the local Heroes of Plataia,
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)rxhge/tai *plataie/wn</foreign>, seven in
number, mentioned in the ‘oracle’ <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title> 11; cp. Rohde, <title>Psyche</title>
(1890) p. 161. A conspicuous site may
be posited for his Heroon. If such a
site is forthcoming, and fits in well with
‘the second (i.e. third) position’ of the
Greeks before Plataia in 479 B C., it
cannot be sacrificed to an <foreign rend="ital">obiter dictum</foreign>
in Thucydides. I have therefore no
hesitation in accepting the Church of
St. John (first proposed by W. J. Woodhouse,
<title>J.H.S.</title> xviii. (1898) 38 ff.) as
marking the Androkrateion as surely
as the Church of St. Demetrion on the
neighbouring ridge to the east marks one
of the temples of Eleusinian Demeter
(as proposed by Dr. Grundy; cp. c. 57
<foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>).</p>
<p>There is nothing to show that Hdt. in
this passage conceived Gargaphia as
marking the extreme right of the Greek
position, and the Androkrateion as
marking the extreme left, a point on
which Rawlinson rightly demurs to
Grote. The Church of St. John occupies
the lower of two summits (300 and 360
ft. respectively above the Asopos Bridge)
<pb n="641"/>
which are both alike comprised in the
‘Asopos Ridge.’ The Greeks, now
offering battle, will have occupied both
these summits, directly in advance of
the two springs, or well-heads, (ii.) and
(iv.) above, whieh dispute the uame
Gargaphia, and both sources will have
been used by the troops: Dr. Grundy's
Gargaphia by the right wing, Apotripi
by the centre, while the Athenians and
left wing may have had to draw from
the stream A. 1 (not wholly dependent
on Apotripi for its water). This position
suits the description <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia\ o(/xqwn te ou)k u(yhlw=n

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)nqau=ta e)n th=| diata/ci</lem></app>. If
Hdt. means that the dispute between
the Tegeatans and Athenians took place
in the Asopos positiou, aud before the
forces are disposed in position, he meaus
what is mauifestly absurd. What then
does he suppose the order to have been
in the previous position? Hdt. has not
concerned himself to realize the conditions
of his own story; but the story,
however fantastie, doubtless has some
ground in actual occurreuces Some
time or other, at some place or other, it
was discussed aud decided what the
order of battle should be on the Greek
side. In Attica the Atheuiaus might
conceivably have claimed the post of
honour on the right wing, though such
a claim had hardly been consistent with
the <title>Hegemonia</title> of the Spartans; but it
appears that the Atheniaus with the
Megarians actually formed the head of
the matching column (<foreign rend="ital">agmen</foreign>) from
Eleusis to Erythrai. In a Spartan army
the king commanded from the centre;
cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.72.4">Thuc. 5. 72. 4</bibl> (but Kleombrotos
apparently commauded the right wing
at Leuktra, Plutarch, <title>Pelop.</title> 23). It is
conceivable that the questiou of the
exact order of battle was not fully resolved
before the Greeks reached
Erythrai; or, agaiu, that the turn taken
by the ‘Hippomachy,’ and the development
of the first Greek position, brought
about au order and a situation which
had not been distinctly foreseeu. The
Greek ethuie contingents must have
extended along the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> iu some
defiuite order, whether the Athenians
were then ou the extreme left or on the
extreme right. In the latter case the
manœuvre described below in e. 46 may
have taken place, or have been anticipared,
and so brought the Athenians ou
to the left wing, the Lakedaimonians on
to the right; or this result may have
been obtained by an advance <foreign rend="ital">en échelon</foreign>
dowu the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> and on to the Asopos
Ridge. If (as appears to me less probable)
the Athenians had evacuated Erythrai
and moved to the left, along the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>,
making room for the remaiuder of the
marching column to form up in line,
the Lakedaimoniaus beiug on the extreme
right; theu, this order had probably
beeu already decided on, and it was too
late for the Tegeatai to enter a claim;
but the story of the dispute may come
to have been associated with the trausition
from the <foreign rend="ital">agmen</foreign> to the <foreign rend="ital">acies,</foreign> and
that transition itself to be confounded
with the advance on to the Asopos.
Hdt., for whom the problem of the
conversion of the marching column, or
columns, into the fighting line simply
does not exist, has placed the record as
an appendix to a description of the
(second) position, in which the disposition
of the forces in fighting array, in actual
line of battle, was effected, or made

‘The sons of Herakles attempted to effect

with participle, as 7. 139. 7 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
Hdt., by the mouth of the Tegeatai, here
makes reference to the all-important
legend of the Expulsion, or Bauishment,
and Return of the Herakleids (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( ka/qodos
tw=n *(hrakleidw=n</foreign>), the sobriquet in the
fifth century, as this passage among
others proves, for the Dorian Conquest.
One important chapter in the story of
‘the Restoration’ Hdt. elsewhere (6. 55)
declines to narrate, on the ground that
it has already been put on record by
other writers. That reason has not
operated with him here to preclude his
telling the story of the duel between
Hyllos and Echemos, and the failure of
the first attempt of the ‘exiles’ to
return. (Cp. Introduction, §§ 7, 8.)</p>
<p>The antecedents of the story of the
Duel are supplied iu part by the speech of
the Athenians in c 27, in part by <bibl n="Thuc. 1.9.2">Thucyd.
1. 9. 2</bibl> (cp. <bibl n="Apollod. 2.8">Apollod. <title>Biblioth.</title> 2. 8</bibl>).
The story was that the ‘Herakleids’ or
‘Perseids,’ as they were in the last resort
(cp. 6. 53), had been deposed by
the ‘Pelopids’ (the Egyptian by the
Asiatic!), Eurystheus, himself a Perseid,
having first expelled the Herakleids and
then perished in Attica, warring against
them, leaving Atreus (the Pelopid) in
possession at Mykenai.</p>
<p>To this ‘fytte’ succeeds the Duel of
Hyllos and the ‘Arkadian’ king recorded
in this place by Hdt. Thereafter for
three generations, a century, the Herakleids
abandon the attempt to ‘return,’
until, as leaders of the Dorians, and led
by the one-eyed Aitalian Oxylos, they
cross from Naupaktos, and effect the
conquests of the three great districts,
Argolis, Laconia, Messenia.</p>
<p>The subjection of Herakles to Eurystheus
appears in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 15.639"><title>Il.</title> 15. 639</bibl> f.),
where the Hero is despatched to Hell to
fetch the Houud (<title>Il.</title> 8 363 ff., <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.617-627"><title>Od.</title> 11.
617-627</bibl>). Herakles also figures as the
enemy of the Neleids (<title>Il.</title> 11 689 ff).
Is this a Dorian Herakles? The <title>Iliad</title>
of course will know nothing of Dorians
as such. How old the ‘Herakleid’
legend is one can hardly say, Tyrtaios,
<title>Fr.</title> 2, in which it appears (though
not explicitly as a ‘Return’), even if
genuine, is not older than the middle of
the seventh century B.C. The expedition
of Eurystheus into Attica against
Hyllos and the Herakleids was narrated
by Hekataios, cp. Longinus 27. 2 (ed.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
Vahlen p. 41) and Pherekydes (Anton.
Lib. <title>Metam.</title> c. 33, <title>Mythogr. Gr.</title> ed.
Westermand p 230). Cp. <bibl n="Diod. 4.38">Diodor. 4. 38.</bibl>

a rich prose literature on Herakles and
the Herakleids, to say nothing of the
poetic development attested by Hesiod,
Pindar, aud the dramatists; and in
regard to Hdt. it is especially to be
remembered that his uncle Panyasis had
composed au epic on Herakles in 9000

These Eleusinian tombs are here referred

of the ‘Mykenaian’ type and age, such
as have been discovered at Eleusis;
cp. <title>Ephemeris Archaiologike,</title> 1898, pp.

expect the Athenian orator to admit that
in the Mykenaian age Eleusis (to say
nothing of Eleutherai) was quite independent
of Athens. The Atheniau claims
in regard to the Argive heroes may (I
suppose) be regarded as part of the
Theseian legend, which was cultivated
assiduously in Athens from the days of
Peisistratos ouwards. The conflict between
this passage and the <title>Antigone,</title>

with the Acts of Theseus. Aischylos,
<title>Eumenid.</title> 655 ff., treats the case as

<p>Pindar had celebrated the wedding of
Theseus and the Amazonian Queen (cp.
Plutarch, <title>Theseus</title> c. 78; Pausan. 1. 2 1).
The archaeological evidence (ceramic)
tends, however, to show that the connexion
with Theseus is not really
ancient: Herakles, not Theseus, appears
on black figured vases with the Amazons,
and his place is taken by Theseus on
the red figured (cp. Graef <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> PaulyWissowa,
I. 1773, 1777). The growing
importance and expansion of the Theseus
legend dates from about the middle of the
sixth century. Plutarch, <title>Thes.</title> 27, shows
that the Atthidographers (Hellanikos,
Kleidemos, and others) were busy on the
subject, as probably the Logographers,
Mythographers, before them had been;
and the epic of Theseus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*qhshi/s</foreign>, Aristot.
<title>Poet.</title> 8 = 1451 A, Plut. <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> 28) was
perhaps an earlier work (cp. Bergk, <title>Gr.

<title>Amazonia,</title> ascribed to Homer by Suidas
<foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(/omhros</foreign>, Bergk <foreign rend="ital">l.c.,</foreign> perhaps too
sceptically, regards as a literary hypothesis
(might not the <title>Amazonia</title> be a
section of the <title>Theseis?</title>). The battle of
the Amazons was represented in the great
fresco by Mikon in the <title>Poikile Stoa</title> (cp.
<bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 678">Aristoph. <title>Lysistr.</title> 678</bibl>, <bibl n="Paus. 1.15.2">Pausan. 1. 15. 2</bibl>),
and Pheidias placed the same subject in
relief upon the shield of the Virgin (E.
Gardner, <title>Anc. Ath.</title> 349), and again on the
metopes on the west front of her temple
(<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign> 282).</p>
<p>There is nothing surprising in Hdt.,
or even an Athenian orator of 479 B.C.,
taking the story of the Amazonian war
for granted Hdt.'s other story of the
Amazons (4. 110-117) involves a war of
the Greeks on the Thermodon, and may
be connected with the cycle of Herakleslegends
at least in the first instance
(cp. <bibl n="Paus. 2.1.1">Pausan. 2. 1. 1</bibl>): at any rate in this

in Attica were other than the aggressors.

ad&lt;*&gt;t that ten years had been enough
to start the Marathonian legend on a
colossal scale: like the infant Herakles
it strangles snakes in its cradle. The
formula here has three notable points
fully developed. (1) The omission of
the Plataians from the muster-roll of
Marathon, the ‘aloneness’ of the Athenians
in their hour of need: not a very
graceful, or probable, touch on the battlefield
of Plataia, even if the Spartans
could bear to be reminded that they
had been conspicuous by their absence at
Marathon:  <foreign xml:lang="greek">mounomaxh/santes tw=| *pe/rsh|</foreign> is
meant to emphasize the <foreign xml:lang="greek">mou=noi</foreign>, not to
represent the battle as a duel between
Athens and the Persian; for ‘the
Persian’ is but one of forty-six nations.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| *mh/dw|</foreign> might have been expected
here. But cp. App. Crit. (2) The

(3) “We defeated six-and-forty nations.”
The Athenian orator on the field of
Plataia in 479 B.C. is already in possession
of the army-list of Xerxes 7. 60-80,
which enumerates just forty-six <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/qnea kat)
h)/peiron strateuo/mena</foreign>. The first alternative
that presents itself is to choose
between the authenticity of the speech
and that of the list, as a list of what it
professes to be: either the speech is not
genuine, or the list was made long before
480 B.C. But the list may be made
older than 480 B.C. without guaranteeing
the authenticity of the speech. Are we
in the presence of an Athenian development
and gross exaggeration intended to
elevate Marathon above Plataia, and the
defeat of the army of Dareios under
Datis and Artaphrenes at Marathon
above the defeat of the army of Xerxes
under Mardonios and Artabazos at
Plataia? How came Hdt. by such a
stroke as this? He certainly did not
mean it as a satire upon Athenian
braggartness. Had he previously written
the story of Marathon, he might have
been saved from such an inconsequence:
this point supports the hypothesis of
the prior composition of Bks. 7-9;
cp. Introduction, §§ 7, 8. This view of
Marathon throws Salamis also completely
into the shade: that too was a part of
the anti-Themistoclean tendency which
had long been at work when Hdt. first
composed his history of the war.</p></div>

surprise and indignation (cp. 7. 17
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>): ‘is it not right, we should like
to know, for us to have this privileged
position on the strength of this one
achievement even if it stood alone?’—
But why is no allusion whatever made
to the splendid services of Olympiodoros
and his 300 (cc. 21, 22 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)? Is the
sequence of events correctly reproduced
by Hdt.? Did this dispute succeed
that service? Did the Athenians make
such a speech as is here put into their
mouths? In any case Hdt. can hardly

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">a)ll' ou) ga\r ktl.</lem></app> Who would

they represent the better temper which
governed the policy and action of Athens

in a less happy vein, like the
earlier passages of this very speech, or
the <foreign rend="ital">ultima ratio</foreign> in c. 11 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The
end is in better keeping with the
practical result. The moral of the
previous boast might have been to
assign not ‘the other wing’ but the
whole duty of quelling the foe to the
Athenians. If they had once already
all by themselves defeated the six and
forty nations of Asia, why should they
not do it again? Why had they
worried the Peloponnesians to come to
their aid? Why even threatened to
make terms with the enemy?</p></div>

advent of these reinforcements, in

that in part emboldened the Greeks to

body-servant (<foreign xml:lang="greek">qera/pwn</foreign>) of the Spartiate
hophte, and the six others members of a
regiment under the king's command.
Bnt (1) where is there any other
evidence of snch a proportion as the
normal one? (2) When were Spartan
armies so well supplied with <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign>? (3)
What record is there of the services of
these <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign> in the actual fighting? (4)
The request of Pausanias for the Athenian
<foreign xml:lang="greek">toco/tai</foreign>, c. 60 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>—no doubt from a
tainted source — still emphasizes the
defect of the Spartan contingent in light
troops, and exploits it, if you like. (5)
The phraseology here does not suggest a
closed or organized corps of 20,000-30,000
helot <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign>, but a distributive number
of 35,000 <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi\ qera)pontes</foreign>. (6) Politically,
the idea of an organization of a
helot corps of 30,000 <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign> at Sparta is
well-nigh inconceivable: such a corps
would have effected a revolution! Even
Pausanias, in his subsequent tampering
with the helots, has not got such a
basis as that to work on, or we should
have heard of it; cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.132.4">Thuc. 1. 132. 4</bibl>.
(7) The normal allowance of <foreign xml:lang="greek">qera/pontes</foreign>
appears rather to have been one per
hoplite, cp 7. 229 (and 186): the
emphasis which is here laid on the
number 7 suggests that it is abnormal.
(8) If the numerical figures in the text
are to stand, other employment must be
found for the huge number of helots,
and may be found, as an <title>Army Service,</title>
engaged in forwarding supplies, cp. c. 39
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> These reasons are sufficient to
disprove the fact and figures here; but
they leave Hdt. responsible for an
egregious blunder. The only rescue for
him would be to challenge the text:
are the figures corrupt? The <foreign rend="ital">testimonia</foreign>
carry them back to Plutarch (<title>Aristeid.</title>
10) (but neither Diodoros nor Trogus
recorded them). This assertion that
there were seven helots for every Spartan
is made not less than five times in this
Book (cc. 10, 28, 29 (<foreign rend="ital">bis</foreign>), 61 <foreign rend="ital">implicite</foreign>):
this very iteration rouses suspicion of
the fact, if not of the text. Few critics
will be so hardy as to expose a five-fold
systematic and consistent <foreign rend="ital">corruptela!</foreign>

Poteidaia was, of course, a colony of

Six hundred seems a small contingent
from the third city of Arkadia: perhaps
the tardy exit of the Mantineians kept
some of the Orchomenians and other
Arkadians at home. It is not clear
what the constitution of Orchomenos

constitution was certainly aristocratic,
or oligarchic, in 418 B.C. (cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.61.4">Thuc. 5.

These ancients, a poor remnant
of the ‘Perseid’ and ‘Pelopid’ ages,
might have ‘medized’ with a better grace
than the Dorian Argives. Their hostility
to Argos would seal them to the side
of Sparta and of Hellas, of which they
might fairly consider themselves the
oldest representatives. ‘Tiryns’ here
appears for the first time in the war;
‘Mykenai’ had sent 80 men to Thermopylai,
7. 202, unless, indeed, those and
these alike are ‘exiles’? It is hard
to see how with Argos neutral, or
malevolent, Tiryns and Mykenai could
have afforded to send their fighting men
to Plataia; but cp. c. 12 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The
ruin of Mykenai was still to come or
was unknown to Hdt. when he first
drafted this passage; cp. 6. 83.</p>
<p>(An <foreign rend="ital">obiter dictum</foreign> in J. P. Mahaffy's
<title>Survey of Gk. Civilization,</title> 1897, p. 31,
to which Hall's <title>Oldest Civilization,</title> 1901,
p. 291, directed my attention, treats
these Mykenaians and Tirynthians as
‘of course exiles’ in view of Mahaffy's
theory that the destruction (final?) of
Mykenai and Tiryns by Argos ‘happened
in the eighth or early seventh century
B.C.’ But the names occur upon the
Plataian (and Olympian) monuments,
and it is not likely that those lists
included ‘cityless men.’ This observation
cuts out my own suggestion up
above, that these men were exiles from
the still existing Mykenai and Tiryns.
Mahaffy's prochronism for the destruction
of the two cities appears to be
partly mixed up with the view that
Perseids and Pelopids ‘possessed neither
the art of writing nor the art of coining,’
plus the complementary view that
Mykenaians and Tirynthians of the
sixth and fifth centuries would have
possessed both. Perhaps they did, even
though no specimens have come down
to us. As to the Perseids and Pelopids,
we now know that they could write,
and it is hardly safe to assume that
they had no coinage or currency. On
the whole I should adhere to the dates
given in note <foreign rend="ital">ad l.c.</foreign> for the destruction
of Tiryns and Mykenai. Meyer, <title>G. d.
Alt.</title> iii. (1901) p. 516, well remarks that
a ‘Tirynthian’ is victor at Olympia

wing and right centre are, if the figures
be at all trustworthy, very much
stronger than the left centre and left
wing (22,800 as compared with 15,900).
Men of Phleiûs (200) had served under
Leonidas (7. 202) and again at the
Isthmos in 480 B.C. (8. 72). Phleiûs
was accounted a Dorian city (<bibl n="Paus. 2.13.1">Pausan.

anti-Argive and a loyal adherent of
Sparta's (cp. Thne. 4. 70. 1, 133. 3, 5.
57. 2 etc.); hence, perhaps, in part the
enthusiasm of Xenophon for the men
of Phleiûs, though they were conspicuous
by their absence in the battle of Korinth
in 394 B.C. (<title>Hell.</title> 4. 2. 16); but that
is to be explained by inner dissensions

With this contingent the Peloponnesian

(cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.27.2">Thuc. 1. 27. 2</bibl>), but were the 200
men here mentioned all from the one
township? Kephallenia was annexed by
Athens in 431 B.C. (Thuc. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>), a fact
which Hdt. was in no way bound to
notice, but of which anyway he shows
no consciousness.</p>
<p>It is Stein's suggestion that Hdt. read
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*p*a*l*e*e*s</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="greek">v*a*l*e*i*o*i</foreign> on the
inscription at Olympia, described by
<bibl n="Paus. 5.23.1">Pausanias 5. 23. 1</bibl>, as the name of the
Eleians is given by Pausanias and that
of the Paleis is not given. This is simply
an inversion of the old suggestion of
P. O. Broendsted (Bursian, <title>G. d. class.
Philol.</title> 1048; cp. Grote, iv. 256 n.
and Rawlinson iv.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> 395, each spelling
the name differently, and both wrongly)
that Pausanias read <foreign xml:lang="greek">v*a*l*e*i*o*i</foreign> for
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*p*a*l*e*e*s</foreign>. The old suggestion is much
the better of the two. In Hdt.'s time
the inscription was new and cleat; in
the time of Pausanias it was 600 years
old. The name of the Eleians was to
be expected, especially at Olympia, rather
than that of the small Kephallenian
township. Grote adds that the Eleians
<pb n="655"/>
might have altered the name, and that
Plutarch <foreign rend="ital">de m. Hdti = Mor.</foreign> 873 seems
to have read the same inscription as
Pausanias.</p>
<p>It remains, however, still to be proved
that Hdt had read the inscription at
Olympia before writing down this list.
Doubtless an official document of some
kind underlies the list here, but it need
not have been the precise inscription at
Olympia, nor again need Hdt. have
copied that document himself. The list
of Hdt. differs from the list of Pausanias
not merely by the point above specified,
but in others: Pausanias omits Eretrians
and Leukadians, and inserts five names

gives the numbers of the contingents,
which were certainly not on the inscription.
There is not the slightest reason
to suppose that Hdt. compiled his armylist
for Plataia at Olympia; it is even
less likely than that he compiled his
navy-list for Salamis at Delphi (cp. 8.
82). The army-list was probably part
of the original draft of the work, not an
addition; cp. further, Introduction, § 10.</p>

marked by the Androkrateion, Gargaphia,

why <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=| *)aswpw=|</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">simpliciter,</foreign> in c. 30?
Is it that the various passages are from
various sources, and that Hdt. does not
very strictly co-ordinate them? That
may be so, yet hardly explains the
introduction of <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n tau/th| r(e/onta</foreign>. The
locative adverb is strictly relative to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n
*plataih=|si</foreign>, and seems to imply that the
Persian moved from the Asopos, where
it was not <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n *pl.</foreign>, to the Asopos where it
was. But, even so, a difficulty is left, as
the Laager is described in c. 15 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> as
reaching <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s th\n *plataii/da gh=n</foreign>. That is,
however, the Laager: here he is speaking
of the line of battle. We must suppose
that Mardonios moves out of his camp
into battle-line, formed up along the
higher course of the Asopos. It is clear
in the sequel that the Persians are on
the left bank of the river. Is Mardonios
aiming to circumvent the Greek position
by turning its left flank, or simply offering
battle if they will cross the river?</p>
<p>G B. Grundy, <title>G.P. W.</title> p. 470, cp.
<title>Topography</title> p. 19, suggests that the phrase
here in question denotes the main stream
of the Asopos, or even ‘the Thespian
Asopos,’ as distinguished from the
Plataian Asopos, though he clearly sees
that <foreign xml:lang="greek">tau/th|</foreign> refers to <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n *plataih=|si</foreign>. If anything
but the main stream were here
meant, it would be, not the branch from
Lenktra, but the branch from Plataia, i.e.
A<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. But the contrast is not between
two branches of the river, but between
the main stream, in the neighbourhood
of the Persian camp, and the same main
stream a little higher up, in the neighbourhood
of the Greek position.</p>
<p>Stein, who leaves the Persians and the
Persian camp on the right bank of the
river all this time, thinks there must be
a lacuna in the narrative. No doubt
there are many gaps in the narrative,
and many omissions, but Hdt. has
duly taken the Persians across the
Asopos long ago (c. 15 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and
Mardonios has not had to cross the river
in order to take up the position here
described.</p>
<p>We may, perhaps, paraphrase the
phrase <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n *)aswpo\n to\n tau/th| r(e/onta</foreign>,
‘the Asopos, in this part of its course,’
i.e. where it flows through the land of
Plataia: emphasis is perhaps laid on the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">r(e/onta</foreign> to show that there was water in
the river-bed.</p></div>

This account of Mardonios' battle-array
may be in part at least drawn from a
source (or sources) on the Persian side,
for example, Hdt.'s friend from Orchomenos
(c. 16 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); but it is hardly
based on authoritative and documentary
sources, or it would be fuller and more
precise in regard to numbers, names of
commanders, and so forth: more, in
fact, like the army-list in Bk. 7. Mardonios'
men are arranged in five ethnic
divisions, Persians, Medes, Baktrians,
Indians, Sakians (the medized Greeks
not included). If each of these divisions
represents a myriad, he had 50,000 men
under his command (with perhaps an
additional myriad (?) of cavalry); if two
myriads, 100,000; or with the army
corps of Artabazos, approximately
150,000: further it is hardly necessary
to go. The infantry and cavalry are
not distinguished from each other in the
description here given. The cavalry
might have been all in front of the
infantry (as at the battle of the Granikos
in 334 B.C.) or on the wings; it can
scarcely have been in the rear, much
less mixed up with the infantry. As
the Persian forces all freely crossed the
river, the cavalry was probably on the
wings; and further, the Persian cavalry
was now on the left, and the BoiotioThessalian
on the right. Hdt. describes
the divisions of the Persian army with
reference to the ethnic divisions on the
Greek side, already enumerated, but
with the remarkable result of suggesting
a somewhat different ordering of the two
wings and the centre, especially of the
centre and the left wing, the whole
Greek army now falling, like the Persian,
into six eorps, four in the centre, two on
the wings, and the constituent items
of these corps—except in the case of the
right wing—being varied as against the
previous army-list. This slight inconsequence
again points to a difference in
the sources for the two army-lists at
Plataia.</p></div>

Hoplites, counted <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> one
myriad. There are besides 40,000 <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign>,
whose exact station on the battle-field
is not clearly defined. Greatly to
outnumber these 50,000 the Persians
must have exceeded a fifth of the whole
forces of Mardonios. (That in itself is
not impossible!) If only Hoplites are
considered, a myriad Persians, or at
most two, would serve. If the cavalry
is on the extreme left, Persian footmen
might easily out-flank a myriad Lakedaimonians,
drawn up not less than eight
deep, and possibly deeper; but Hdt.,
starting, of course, with a belief in the
immense numerical superiority on the
side of Mardonios, not only makes the
‘Persians’ overlap the Tegeatai, but
gives them an extra deep formation.</p></div>

but ‘more thau he would otherwise have
done,’ or ‘than was usual.’ At Marathon,
where the Athenians, according to Hdt.,
formed up for battle after the Persians,
in order to draw out a line as long as
the Persian, Kallimachos had to diminish
his centre <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ ta/cias</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)li/gas</foreign> 6. 111. In
the present case Mardonios is represented
as drawing up in battle-array after the
Greeks, but he has no apparent desire
to out-flank them, so having men to
spare he deepens his ranks. Oddly
enough, the order was the same on the
Greek side the wings are much stronger,
and probably much deeper than the
centre; the tactics of Marathon were
repeated—or the legend of Marathon
was composed in the light of Plataia.</p></div>

perhaps by the assumption that each of
the six divisions, like the division of
Artabazos, which is not here brought
into line, consisted approximately of
50,000 men. That would involve an
average twelve thousand each for Boiotia,
Lokris, Malis, Thessaly! The Boiotians
might have brought 5000-6000 Hoplites
(cp. <bibl n="Thuc. 5.57.2">Thuc. 5. 57. 2</bibl>, Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 4. 2.
17); the Thessalians will have been
chiefly mounted men; the Lokrians and
Malians may have raised 1500-2000
Hoplites between them: all told, the
Greek Hoplites on the Persian right
wing will not have numbered more
than one myriad, and they are here
opposed to the Athenians, Plataians and
Megarians, who number together 11,600
men. But there are the Thessalian and

The Egyptian fleet of 200 ships might
have mustered 6000 Epibatai (cp. 7. 184)
while intact; but then, were they
‘Egyptians’? Cp. 7. 96. The statement
that Mardonios, while still in
Phaleron, debarked these Epibatai for
his own purpose deserves attention.
What becomes of the hasty flight of
the fleet from Salamis (8. 107)? What
becomes of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">dia/krisis</foreign> of the forces
in Thessaly (8. 113)? It might be
argued from the presence of Egyptians
in the forces of Mardonios that the fleet,
or some porition of it, the Egyptian
squadron at least, aecompamed the king
on his retirement. The assertion that
Mardonios selected the Egyptian Epibatar
at Phaleron is obviously the translation
into narrative of the reason, which
immediately follows (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) ga\r e)ta/xqhsan
ktl.</foreign>), in the light of the supposed
departure of the fleet straight from
Salamis, 8. 107. It is true that, according
to <foreign rend="ital">l.c.,</foreign> Xerxes before the departure
of the fleet <foreign xml:lang="greek">kale)sas *mardo/nion e)ke/leuse/
min th=s stratih=s diale/gein tou\s bou/letai</foreign>,
and to fulfil his engagement. But
nothing is there said of taking any men
from the fleet, and Mardonios himself,
only a few hours before, has been
inveighing against the cowardice of the
Egyptians, etc. (8. 100), in a way hardly
consistent with his including them in
his select force!</p>
<p>The fair inference, however, is not
that there were Egyptians all along in
the land-forces, but that Hdt. in various
contexts preserves various stories and
<pb n="663"/>
statements from various sources, often
contradictory or more or less contrary
to each other, without staying to criticize,
to harmonize, to reduce all to selfconsistency.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="11">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">trih/konta muria/des</lem></app>: 300,000 is the
figure which Hdt. consistently maintams
for the fighting men of Mardonios.
This figure, however, in 8. 113 appears
to include the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppei=s</foreign>. Here the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppei=s</foreign>
appear not to be included. It also
includes the 60,000 (infantry and cavalry)
of the division of Artabazos, 8. 126.
This division is given as only 40,000
below (c. 66), and though the difference
may be accounted for by the supposed
loss of 20,000 before Poteidaia, and in
Thrace (cp. 8. 126-129), yet Hdt. fails
to subtract these two myriads from the
estimate of Mardonios' forces in this
place.</p>
<p>The army of Mardonios consists of
five divisions, above described, together
with a sixth of ‘Greek allies,’ which
Hdt. computes at 50,000 men (making
350,000 in all). Probably the division
of Artabazos may be considered here to
be absent, and the five divisions of
barbarians may be taken as each consisting
<foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> of 50,000, or 250,000 in
all; that is, each division consists of
five myriads (nominal), each under a
myriarch (and each myriad again is
snbdivided into 10 chiliads, nominal,
each led by a chiliarch). The division
perhaps consists of 4 myriads of foot,
and 1 myriad of cavalry. If Artabazos
had really 60,000 men in his division,
he may have had an extra myriad,
perhaps cavalry, for the king's escort;
or the figure may have been reached by
reckoning his division as 50,000 <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezoi/</foreign>,
and adding a myriad <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppei=s</foreign>—in fact,
eounting the myriad of cavalry twice
over; the 40,000 men in c. 66 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>
represents his normal number of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pezoi/</foreign>.</p>
<p>But this army of Mardonios, in six
divisions of 50,000 each, viz. 40,000
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pezoi/</foreign> + 10,000 <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppei=s</foreign>, is none other than
the original army of Xerxes, the organization
of which has been quite clearly, not
quite consciously, indicated in Bk. 7,
where the numbers have been vastly
exaggerated.</p>
<p>Either, then, Mardonios retained the
whole army <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n a(/ma *ce/rch| a)piko/menon</foreign>,
and was in command of a (nominal)
300,000, a very improbable alternative;
or he did indeed only command a selection,
or a section, of the grand army, perhaps
the very division, 50,000 strong, of which
he had been all al&lt;*&gt;g in command, while
Artabazos commanded a second division
of equal strength, the army of 479 B.C.
numbering in all 100,000—exclusive of
the European allies; or possibly Mardonios
commanded two divisions, which
with the division under Artabazos might
raise the total Asiatic forces in Europe
to 150,000, or thereabouts. See further,
Appendices II. § 5, and VIII § 2.</p>

Hdt.'s own conjecture of 50,000 is perhaps
relative to the figure already given, at
least implicitly, for eaeh of the other
five divisions of the army of Mardonios.
Hdt. makes no attempt to distribute
the total among the items. The chiliad
of Phokians is the only detailed figure
given. It is not likely that the
Boiotians, Lokrians, Malians, Thessalians,
and dwellers in the parts about Thessaly,
with the Makedonians, put 49,000 men
into the field of Plataia. Hdt. is speaking
of fighting men. He only allows
at most 11,600 Hoplites in the Greek
left wing, opposed to this the sixth corps
in the Persian line; cp. 31 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> A
‘myriad’ for the Greek allies of Mardonios

formed part of the battle-array. The

mean that the cavalry had a distinet
position, the infantry being in continuous
formation. But all the cavalry was
not in one place. Most probably the
Greek cavalry was on the extreme right,
and the Persian cavalry on the extreme
left of the position. This conjecture is
borne out by the subsequent narrative,
notably the exploit of the Persian
cavalry in c. 39, and that of the Hellenic
c. 69 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( de\ i(/ppos xwri/s</foreign> curiously

whether Hdt. means to exclude the

cavalry must surely be included in his

be expressly included in the 300,000.

‘Teisamenos was copying Melampûs.’
The story of Melampûs here is a
digression within a digression, but may
be of the same date in the composition
of Hdt.'s work as the story of
Teisamenos; see, however, below, and
Introduction, § 9. ‘Teisamenos did
but follow the example of Melampûs’
(Hdt. is great on plagiarists; so
Kleisthenes of Athens copied his grandfather
of Sikyon, 5. 67) ‘with a
difference.’ <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s ei)ka/sai basilhi/hn te
kai\ polihti/hn ai)teome/nous</lem></app> (cp. App.
Crit.), ‘if we may compare men together
who were demanding respectively kingship
and citizenship’ Melampûs was
even more exigeant than Teisamenos.
Melampûs had still reputed descendants
in Greece; a descendant of his
was with Leonidas at Thermopylai, cp.
7. 221. His death perhaps created the
vacancy filled by the Eleian. Hdt. gives
the name of the father of Melampûs
as Amytheon, 2. 49 (i.e. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)amuqa/wn</foreign>), and
if the patronymic always proved the
earliest notice, that passage would be of
earlier composition than this, and this
digression on Melampûs (probably) of
later composition (third hand) than the
digression on Teisamenos (second hand)
in which it is embedded. Amythaon
apparently belongs (in Homer) to the
south Thessalian cyele; his mother is
Tyro, his father Krethens, his brothers
are Aison and Pheres, the Poseidonian
Peliasand Nelens are his uterine brethren,
<bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.253"><title>Od.</title> 11. 253</bibl> ff. A part of Elis was
named <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)amuqaoni/a</foreign>, Steph. B. <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign>
(‘perhaps the territory of Triphylian
Pylos,’ Hirschfeld <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Pauly. Wissowa i.
2014). Amythaon himself has been
traced to a chthonian source, as ‘a
personification of Hades’ (cp. Wernicke,
<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>). Melampûs is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ma/ntis a)mu/mwn</foreign>
who won the daughter of Nelens ‘for
his brother,’ <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.291"><title>Od.</title> 11. 291</bibl>, a story more
fnlly set forth <title>Od.</title> 15 226 ff., where
Pylos is given as his proper home, whence
he passes to Argos, <foreign xml:lang="greek">naie)menai polloi=sin
a)na/ssont' *)argei/oisin</foreign>, without the process
being further explained — which,
however, hardly proves that ‘Homer’
did not ‘know’ the explanation.</p>
<p><bibl n="Diod. 4.68">Diodoros 4. 68</bibl> gives the story in
rationalized form; <bibl n="Apollod. 2.2.2">Apollodoros 2. 2. 2</bibl>
more clearly supplies the part played
by the women, in the first instance the
daughters of Proitos; Pausamas 2. 18. 4
adds the duration of the dynasties.
Five kings succeeded Bias (in four
generations) and six sncceeded Melampûs
(in six generations, down to Amphilochos;
cp. 7. 91 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), i.e. the dynasty or
Melampûs outlasted that of Bias, while
the native dynasty of the house of
Anaxagoras, son of Argos, outlasted
both the others, but was displaced by
Orestes, son of Agamemnon.</p>
<p>The connexion with the Dionysiac
orgies ascribed to Melampûs in 2. 49
does not at first sight square with the

much did he now demand for his
brother? How much did he keep for
himself? How much was he asking for
in all? If he was to have one-half and
his brother one-third, he was asking
now for five-sixths, which is hardly
credible, especially as his demand was
granted. He may have been demanding
still one-half for himself and one-third
of the remaining half for his brother,
i.e. one-sixth of the whole for his brother,
their shares amounting together to twothirds
of the whole. Schweighaeuser
takes it in this sense. The ancient
authorities all take the division as into
three equal thirds. (So Diodor., Pausan.,
Schol. to Pindar, <title>Nem.</title> 9. 30.) There
is this much to be urged for the second
alternative: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) nothing is said by Hdt.

<p>The battle of Tegea, against the
Tegeatai and Argives, like the two
which succeed it, was an episode in those
<foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lemoi oi)kei=oi</foreign> which, according to <bibl n="Thuc. 1.118.2">Thuc.
1. 118. 2</bibl>, preoccupied the Spartans,
during the period of the growth of the
power of Athens, but of which unfortunately
very few details have been preserved
for us. Cp. Strabo 377 <foreign xml:lang="greek">meta\ de\

the destruction of Mykenai; cp. c. 28
<foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> but that was after the outbreak
of the Helot war (Busolt, III. i. 121 n.).
The battle of Tegea probably falls some
years earlier, perhaps while the exiled
Leotychidas was in residence there, 6. 72
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> (and Themistokles already in
Argos?). It was evidently a victory, but
not a decisive victory, for Sparta, as
it was followed by a second great battle
in Arkadia. Busolt (<foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign>) refers the
Epigram of Simonides (Bergk iii. 460,
No. 102) to the Tegeatai who fell in this
fight, and dates the event 473 B.C.</p></div>

resulted in a victory for Sparta. The
Argives are this time conspicuous by
their absence; Busolt (III. i. 121 ff.)

on the ground that Pausanias must
have read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)isqmw=|</foreign> here, as he attempts to
harmonize this passage with Thuc. 1.

emendation <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k tou= seismou=</foreign> has been
frequently advocated. Paumier (Palmerius)
changed the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)isqmw=|</foreign> here to
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)iqw/mh|</foreign>. Those who adhere to the MS.

Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> says there was an old Messeman
king named <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)isqmios</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 4.3.10">Pausan. 4. 3. 10</bibl>)
and that there must have been a place in

better than Rawlinson and Blakesley,
who think that the Isthmos of Korinth
is intended (which would certainly be
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=| *)isqmw=|</foreign>): a battle between the Spartans
and Messenians at ‘the Isthmos’ is
hardly conceivable. The Helot war
broke out in 464 B.C. and lasted ten
years, Thuc. 1. 101-103, Busolt, III. i.
242. Busolt's idea that <foreign xml:lang="greek">*messhni/wn</foreign> here
qualifies <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)isqmw=|</foreign> and distinguishes it

appears to be inadmissible. To give

Nikomedes was in command of the

This assertion may rest on a genuine
tradition, and the fact remains that
Mardonios did finally begin the decisive
battle. Good reasons for his desire are
not far to seek:—(i) He was the aggressor,
the invader, and the initiative naturally
lay with him. (ii.) His own reputation
was at stake, and there was opportunity
for great distinction. (iii.) A victory in
the field was desirable, (1) to impress
his allies, (2) to secure his rear and
communications, (3) perhaps to ease the
situation in Asia and especially to recall
the Greek fleet. (iv) A Persian victory
at Plataia would virtually cancel Salamis,
disrupt the Greek alliance, and probably
lead to the submission of the Hellenes.
(v.) He had succeeded in drawing the
Peloponnesians beyond the Isthmos,
and on to a terrain of his own selection
(cp. c. 13 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). (vi.) Delay was in
their favour, and they were receiving
reinforcements daily; thus a quick
decision was desirable from his point of
view. Mardonios, however, evidently
respected his adversaries, and wished to
fight the battle on his own terms. He
was all but as unwilling as the Greeks
themselves to cross the Asopos, at the
point which they had selected for defence
—<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n *)aswpo\n to\n tau/th| r(e/onta</foreign> c. 31—
and having drawn them beyond the
Isthmos, and over Kithairon, and even
down to the river bank, he may well
have hoped to induce them to cross the
stream. In the sequel, indeed, he seems
to have attempted to push, or sweep
them over it from behind, by sending his
cavalry round the hills, on which they
were posted, and cutting them off from
their water-supply in the rear. Their
retreat surprised him, far more than
their further advance would have done;
and finally lured him across the river,
with disastrous results.</p></div>

been subsequent to that event. If he was

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ta\s e)kbola\s tou= *kiqairw=nos</lem></app>. Hdt.
nowhere betrays any clear consciousness
that there was more than one pass over
Kithairon; but cp. next chapter. The
plural <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)kbolai/</foreign> is without prejudice, as
Hdt. uses the plural (e.g. 7. 176) of
a single route. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)sbolh/</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="greek">e/kbolh/</foreign>, is,
however, the usual term; the word here
seems appropriate from the supposed
speaker's point of view. Neither Timagenidas
nor Mardonios could have any
pass now in view but the main route
over Kithairon to Eleutherai. The
Eleutherai - Plataia road was merely a
branch of this; the Plataia-Megara road
was high on the mountain, very rough
and inaccessible for cavalry, and doubtless,
like the previously named one,
covered by the Greeks. But in moving
from their first position at Erythrai the
Greeks had opened up the main road
(Thebes - Erythrai - Eleutherai), perhaps
relying upon their supplies coming <foreign rend="ital">via</foreign>
Hysiai and Plataia. The Persian cavalry
could now ride freely up the hill past
Erythrai; and once up there might even
sweep to the west along the road to
Hysiai, to Plataia, and so on. If Mardonios
had moved west with a view to
out-flanking the Greek left, he seems
now preparing a diversion on their right.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the advance of the
Greeks from the position ‘at Erythrai’
to the position ‘on the Asopos’ was
encouraged or enforced by the pressure
of the Persian cavalry. It is even conceivable
that Hdt's chronology, or
sequence of events, is here at fault, and
that it was this very exploit of the
cavalry, here recorded, which indueed
the Greeks to advance down from the

Plataia.’ Only one pass is indicated;
but it is one leading, not to Erythrai, or
Thebes, nor to Hysiai, but ‘towards
Plataia.’ Where it leads from Hdt.
does not expressly signify; ultimately
no doubt from the Peloponnesos, but by
which route? It is hardly conceivable
that exactly the same route is signified
by this description as the route by which
in c. 19 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> the confederate forces
marched from Eleusis to Erythrai. But
the route to Plataia from Eleusis (and
so from Athens, or the Peloponnese) is
virtually the same, except in its last
stage, where it breaks away to the west
before descending the gorge to Erythrai,
skirts the further side of the ridge for a
short distance, and comes out through
a distinct gap, possibly covered by
Hysiai, and so down over the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> to
Plataia. It may be this loop to the west
which is here intended. The Persian
cavalry could gain it by riding up the
road past Erythrai into the hills, and
then turning to the right. That would
be the pass leading from Eleutherai
(etc.) to Plataia.</p>
<p>The mere words in the text would
also apply to the pass leading direct to
Plataia from Megara, west of the pass
just described; but that pass was a
difficult one, entirely unsuited to cavalry
operations, or even to the Greek commissariat
service. Stein<hi rend="sup">5</hi> thinks that <foreign rend="ital">de
facto</foreign> this was the pass here in question,
though he does not identify it with
Dryoskephalai. If so Hdt. would have
used this term quite wrongly.</p>
<p>The further designations for the pass
in question may be held to support the
view above adopted.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="5">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*trei=s kefala\s <gap/> *druo\s kefala/s</lem></app>.
The Boiotians had one name for the
pass, the Athenians another; it was a
pass then used by Athenians, which
rules out the Megara - Plataia pass.
Moreover Thncydides proves the point:
3. 24. 1 <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(w/rwn tou\s *peloponnhsi/ous th\n
pro\s *kiqairw=na kai\ *druo\s kefala\s th\n e)p'
*)aqhnw=n fe/rousan meta\ lampa/dwn diw/kontas</foreign>.
The Peloponnesians in that
ease had started from their lines round
Plataia. (Even if <foreign xml:lang="greek">th\n e)p' *)aq. f.</foreign> were a
gloss, the argument remains, and the
identification of Dryoskephalai with the
pass to Megara cannot be entertained.
Baehr, note <foreign rend="ital">adl.,</foreign> ascribes this identification
to Leake and Vischer, and Leake's
map of Plataia, though not his text, lays
him open to the charge, of which Vischer,
<title>Erinnerungen</title> pp. 533, 540, appears
innocent, as he certainly identifies the
‘Three Heads’ pass with the route from
Eleutherai. An explanation of the
term ‘Three Heads’ may be found in
the supposition that it applied primarily
to the meeting-place, or junction of the
three roads, from Eleutherai, from Erythrai
(Thebes), from Plataia. Goettling
suggested that the spot was marked
by a <foreign rend="ital">triceps Hermes,</foreign> hence the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*trei=s
kefalai/</foreign>: cp. Baehr <foreign rend="ital">in l.</foreign> Vischer's idea
that the name is due to the appearance
of three mountain tops (<title>Kuppen</title>) from
the Boiotian side overhauging the pass
is less happy. Why the Athenians
preferred the term ‘Oak's Heads’ is not
recorded; Baehr suggests that it applied
to the route from the Athenian side,
which wound up through forests of oak
(till it reached the top, or ‘head’?).</p></div>

there was no armed convoy, and no

may have been approaching Plataia at
night (see above) to escape notice from
the Persians, and it may have been this

Mardonios by his Theban friends. The

no doubt the Theban, Thessalian and

cavalry on the left rode round
the Lakedaimonians on the Greek right,

suffered less from the medizing Greeks

realization of the Persian hopes. This
record is remarkable for several reasons.</p>
<p>(i.) It implies that there were serious
misgivings on the Persian side as to the
issue of a battle.</p>
<p>(ii.) It suggests that the forward movement
of the Greeks and their occupation
of the second position gave them some
advantage, perhaps threatened the
Persian position more directly than
Hdt. appears to realize. As against
this, however, it seems improbable that
the tradition, so favourable to the
Greeks, and especially to the Athenians,
should have quite forgotten, or missed,
so important a point in their favour.</p>
<p>(iii.) Artabazos cannot be exonerated
from the suspicion of viewing Mardonios
with jealousy, and subordinating the
Persian interest to personal schemes and
rivalries. The story of his subsequent
action or inaction is astounding. The
technical relation between the two
generals is obscure; see below; but,
whatever it was, Artabazos comes badly
out of the affair in the sequel, notwithstanding
a pretty evident bias in his
favour.</p>
<p>(iv.) The plan proposed by Artabazos,
as far as negotiations, bribery and so
forth are concerned, had already been
tried; cp. notes to c. 4 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> It is said
to be supported by the Thebans; it is
indeed their own original idea, cp. c. 2
<foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> but the time has surely gone by
for it now, with the confederate army
in position before them. If there was
a medizing party in the Athenian camp
(<bibl n="Plut. Arist. 13">Plutarch <title>Arist.</title> 13</bibl>) there was an Atticizing
section on the other side of the
Asopos! cp. c. 44 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign></p>
<p>(v.) The idea of retiring into Thebes
is not a sound one, though the proposal
is valuable as implying comparatively
small numbers on the Persian side.
Artabazos might, indeed, have acquired
a respect for Greek fortifications from
his own failure before Poteidaia (8.
126-9), but a siege of Thebes could
hardly have been to the advantage of
the besieged: the Persian cavalry would
have been lost; the abandonment of
the Persian camp on the Asopos was
morally tantamount to a defeat.</p>
<p>(vi.) Hdt. places this debate on the
11th day. But this date may be merely
a dramatic ruse. The difference of
<pb n="681"/>
opinion between Artabazos and Mardonios
will not then first have occurred, or
come to light. It was probably of
longer standing. What line had
Artabazos taken when the policy was
originally proposed by the Thebans, c.
3 <foreign rend="ital">supra?</foreign> Hdt. may have crystallized
and misdated a long standing feud and
difference of opinion. Or has Artabazos
and his <foreign rend="ital">corps d'armée</foreign> only just joined
Mardonios? He has had the whole
summer for his march from Poteidaia,
and Mardonios has already offered
battle.</p>
<p>(vii.) At this point there are perhaps
two alternatives recognizable, one or
other of which Artabazos might have
advocated. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) A tactical stratagem.
Mardonios himself was anxious to draw
the Greeks across the Asopos: why not
retire on Thebes, abandoning even the
camp, with its plate and spoil, for the
nonce, in order to get the Greeks across
the river, and to bring about a general
engagement (cp. Hannibal's ruse, Livy
22. 41 f.)? (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) A strategic coup.
Artabazos may have proposed what he
himself afterwards carried out, retreat,
the evacuation of Boiotia, perhaps of
Greece, the preservation of their two
armies intaet for the king's service.
Artabazos has a special loyalty to
Xerxes. Events in Asia (movement of
the Greek fleet, revolt of Babylon, etc.)
may already have been reported at
Persian headquarters in Boiotia. Such
tactics or such strategy Mardonios
rejected: the first might easily prove a
failure; the second was failure confessed.
The time for political and diplomatic
manœuvring had gone. Under the
circumstances, with the available
evidences, one's sympathies in this
debate must be with Mardonios.</p></div>

Mardonios and Artabazos an obscure
problem. (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) 8. 126 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> looks as
though Artabazos held a post directly
subordinate to Mardonios, inasmuch as
he was in command of 60,000 of Mardonios'
own select soldiers; but that
passage is not convincing, and if 300,000
is really the figure, not for the force of
Mardonios but for the king's grand army
itself (cp. c. 32 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), the passage must
really tell quite the other way. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The
service on which Artabazos is there
engaged points to an independent command,
as does also (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) his subsequent
conduct towards Mardonios c. 66 <foreign rend="ital">infra,</foreign>
and (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) the reception which he afterwards
enjoys at home; had he been
in a position actually subordinate to
Mardonios his reception could hardly
have been so good. Moreover (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>) this
passage itself, closely considered, lends
weight to the supposition that the two
commanders were independent of each
other; Hdt. at any rate has avoided
saying that Artabazos had to take his
orders from Mardonios. Is it not
possible that the exact position of
neither general is fully or clearly stated?
Was the command of Artabazos primarily
a command in Thrace, and the command
of Mardonios a command in Hellas,
south of Olympos? Was Mardonios at
least more than mere ‘commander’?
was he governor, or satrap of Hellas,
for the time being? His Greek ‘allies’
(cp. cc. 31, 32 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) were certainly the
king's subjects. It was only their
presence which gave the army of Mardonios
its numerical superiority to that
of Artabazos. Mardonios is perhaps to
be thought of as defending his own

complicates the situation. ‘There is a
prophecy to the effect that the Persians
after coming to Greece must sack the
temple in Delphi, and thereafter perish
to the last man. We shall not sack the
temple: as far as that is concerned,
then, we are safe enough.’ Mardonios
might have gone on to show some
positive cause for expecting a victory;
he has done that (privately!) already to
Artabazos, viz. (1) the Persian army is
superior to the Greek; (2) there is no
time to be lost, for the Greek army is
increasing day by day; (3) it is the
Persian way to assume the offensive, to
deliver the attack.</p>
<p>The present anecdote has very little
to say to the situation at Plataia; it is
not so much part of the story of Plataia,
as part of the Apology of Delphi. It
explains the fact—a fact so very awkward
for Delphi by and by — that Delphi
escaped pillage at the hands of the
Persians. The explanation is good in
itself, but it is completely at variance
with the other and more brilliant explanation
and apology already given,
viz. the story of the Persian attack on
Delphi, and the miraculous preservation
of the temple and its contents, 8. 35-39.
Both stories cannot be true, though
both may be false. To suppose that if
the Persians, a year before, had done
their best to plunder Delphi, Mardonios
would have urged this line of argument,
in order to cheer and encourage his
Council of War, is absurd (the rather,
as the Delphic god takes the will for
the deed, 6. 86). But this critique
might only be one point more against
the story in Bk. 8, in itself already
incredible. Is the story here true? It
is improbable. Its apologetic tendency
condemns it. The improbability of the
Persian commander-in-chief urging such
a line of argument in any case remains.
Hdt. himself adds that there was no
such oracle: the oracle cited he refers
to another connexion. Last, not least,
considering the real situation in 480-79
B.C., there is hardly room or occasion
for such an oracle, much less for such
a scene in the Persian camp as this
anecdote involves; it is, in the truest
sense, a huge anachronism. Delphi, if
not actually on the Persian side, was on
the side of the Greeks who were on the
Persian side, cp. 7. 132. The question
of a Persian sack of Delphi can hardly
have been a real question at the time;
Xerxes and Mardonios were more likely
to be making offerings at Delphi—like
Datis at Delos in 490 B.C., cp. 6. 97—
than plundering the shrine. It may
fairly be concluded that this anecdote,
though not involving physical impossibtlities,
is not more true, in a strictly
historical sense, than the other.</p></div>

Alexander in thus announcing himself
appears to forget that Aristeides and the

with his appearance, if only from his
embassy to Athens in the previous
winter; cp. 8. 136 ff. The two stories

<p>The historical credibility of this interview
is not high. Certainly, if any
such interview or communication took
place between Alexander of Makedon
and the Athenian Strategoi, the gist
and purport of it were widely different
from this report. Possibly there was
at Plataia some kind of understanding
between the Makedonian and the
Athenians. He had been to Athens, or
to Salamis, a while before, and may have
seen reason to think that Mardonios had
anything but an easy task before him.
To play off the Greeks and the Persians
against each other was the obvious policy
of Makedon. The Athenians may have
used the opportunity to come to an
understanding with the king. He may
have had information of the troubles in
Asia (revolt of Babylon, etc.). The
remarkable success with which, in the
subsequent battle, the Athenians dispose
of 50,000 men opposed to them, and
their comparative immunity during the
occupation of ‘the second position,’
suggest the idea that matters were not
pressed against them. For that they
may have had to thank Alexander, who
was posted on the Persian right.</p></div></div>

Of course, if Pausanias really said all

is imperfect. (Blakesley's trans. is
misleading: “with the very break of day

Hdt. indeed does not expressly say that
the manœuvre was not carried out; he
leaves, however, the impression that it
was not fully carried out, but was
arrested, by the rapid counter-development
on the Persian side, which showed
Pausanias that his purpose had been
discovered.</p>
<p>This chapter perhaps conceals a great
mystery. Presumably there was an
excuse in fact for the story of the
exchange of positions. Some manœuvre,
some development in the position of
the Greeks took place, which lent colour
to the Athenian version of the affair.
Speeches and motivation with Hdt. are
in a different category to acts and
events: the reported order, the chronological
succession of acts and events, is
often less acceptable than the bare acts
or events themselves; they, in turn,
seldom present a complete series, and
frequently undergo a transfiguration, for
better or for worse; but Hdt. is nevertheless
not a mere novelist, not even a
mere historical novelist. All this justifies
considerable freedom in the hypothetical
reconstruction of a story, which in its
traditional form is inadequate and incredible;
and it makes reconstruction
inevitable. The exchange of positions,
according to Hdt., is to take place on
the twelfth day of the occupation by the
Greeks of the position ‘on the Asopos’
marked by the Androkrateion and
Gargaphia. Is it credible that for eleven
days the Greeks occupied this position
unmolested? Why then suddenly on
the twelfth day is the cavalry loosed
upon them, and the position immediately
rendered untenable? Again, why
is so much stress laid on the fact that it
was a man on horseback that came to
the Athenian lines on the night of the
eleventh, if the Greek and Persian
armies were then in close contact, only
separated by the Asopos? If the Makedonian
came on a horse, it was because
he had a good deal of ground to cover;
in other words, the Greeks were not <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\
tw=| *)aswpw=|</foreign> on the eleventh, or any of the
preceding days. Hdt. has apparently
antedated the occupation by the Greeks
of the position ‘on the Asopos,’ that is,
round the Androkrateion, with Gargaphia
in their rear; and has underestimated
and misconceived the ‘first
position’ and its developments, in front
of Hysiai and Plataiai. It was only on
the twelfth that the Greeks descended
to the ‘second’ position, i.e. the hills
in front of Gargaphia ‘on the Asopos’
—probably counting on the Persians
crossing the river to attack them. In
the process of advancing a tactical
manœuvre, or series of manœuvres, is
performed, which is misunderstood,
parodied, and converted <foreign rend="ital">ad maiorem
gloriam Atheniensium</foreign> in this passage
at the expense of the Spartans; exactly
as in a previous passage the move from
the position at Erythrai to the position
at Hysiai had been similarly exploited,
at the expense of the Tegeatai. The
exact nature of the manœuvre may be
a matter of dispute. Hdt. treats the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">meta/tacis</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">metako/smhsis</foreign>, as purely a
question between the two wings, the
centre taking no part in it. In reality
the whole line was doubtless involved.
There was an advance <foreign rend="ital">en échelon,</foreign> which
Atticizing tradition interpreted as an
attempt on the part of the Lakedaimonians
to get into the Athenian position.
There was perhaps more than that, an
actual development, whereby the Lakedaimonians
came to stand where the
Athenians had been standing, on the
extreme left of the line; and again the
Athenians finally, when Gargaphia was
passed, were again standing on the
extreme left of the line. This was the
manœuvre by which the position <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=|
*)aswpw=|</foreign> was actually occupied. Whether
it had the appearance of an attempt to
outflank the Persians, or not, may be
questioned; such can hardly have been
its real purpose. With their hopeless
inferiority in mounted men the Greeks
<pb n="693"/>
would have been courting certain
destruction in moving, or attempting to
move, on Thebes, by the Plataia-Thebes
road. Mardonios draws out his line of
battle on the north bank of the Asopos;
he deploys to the west. The medizing
Greeks, occupying the extreme west of
the Laager, may have been potentially
opposite the Greek right for a while,
until they pushed up the river westwards,
their places being taken by the
Medes and Persians. Mardonios has
now drawn the Greeks down to the
Asopos; he hopes to draw or drive them
across. He gives them no peace all this
day: the cavalry ride round the position
freely, harass them extremely, and
destroy and cut off the water-supply.
For but one single day do the Greeks
maintain themselves in this position;
they have been disappointed of their
expectation that Mardonios would send
his infantry across the Asopos to do
battle, and they determine to retreat (or
to return?) to the position on ‘the
island’ (c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>), or the position of
which the island was the most prominent
feature.</p></div>

speech is an Athenian Appendix to the
previous Athenian self-glorifications.
It contains some sarcastic reflexions on
Spartan reputation, and an extremely
sporting offer, or challenge, on Mardonios'
part. Grote discredíts the
anecdote; Rawlinson defends the
‘Homeric’ (<foreign rend="ital">sic!</foreign>) taunt as quite agreeable
to the practice of primitive and specially
oriental races (rather contradictory
terms), but even he admits that the
challenge is less probable. Here again
we may fairly conjecture that there
was some foundation in fact for the
fiction. The object of Mardonios must
still have been to induce the Greeks
to cross the river. Did he really offer
them a free and unmolested passage?
Or did he offer to come across if they
would give him time to reform on their
side? Such offers are not made in war
<foreign rend="ital">à outrance;</foreign> but the Persians were
cavaliers and sportsmen, and Mardonios
may have thought of the Greeks as his

If little or nothing has been heard of the
Persian cavalry for twelve days, it must
be because the Greeks were in a position
where the cavalry could not get at them,
or else because the services of the cavalry
have been suppressed. The cavalry,
however, had at least cut the Greek
lines of communication by Dryoskephalai,
c. 39 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> If they had
not also already destroyed Gargaphia,
and rendered the Greek position at
Gargaphia untenable, it must be because
that position had not been occupied by
the Greeks until this very day, to wit,

were reduced to the necessity of advancing

Gargaphia and its neighbouring wells

The Greek position along the

that the parts of the army which were
not near Gargaphia were near the Asopos

description of their position as
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ tw=| *)aswpw=|</foreign>. It is possible, however,
that Dr. G. B. Grundy's suggestion (for
a phrase (in c. 31 <foreign rend="ital">supra, q.v.</foreign>) is here
applicable, and that ‘Asopos’ is here
used of stream A<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, though not with

been probably one of the chief reasons
for their advance to the position on the

battle to the Persian, if only he
would come across the Asopos with his
infantry. Mardonios had perhaps turned
them out of their position at Hysiai by
seizing and occupying Dryoskephalai,
and forced them to come down to the
Asopos and offer battle; he is still, no

them across the Asopos. Hdt., who
keeps the Greeks twelve days on the
Asopos Ridge, for eleven of which they
are absolutely unmolested and allowed
to water freely from Gargaphia, now at
last admits that battle or retreat is a
necessity, owing to the complete breakdown
of the commissariat; that breakdown
being due to the complete command
attained by the Persian cavalry of the
main route to the rear of the Greek
forces. The difficult Plataia-Megara pass
remains indeed open; and it is just upon
that they resolve to fall back, for even
that pass was no use to them in their

<foreign xml:lang="greek">ma/xhs a)=rcai</foreign>. The participial construction
is noticeable. Only one course is treated
as open to the Greeks, viz. to retreat.
But there was another, viz. to advance,
to cross the Asopos, to assume the
offensive. That was what Alexander did
at the Gramkos; but then, Alexander's
army was not composed simply of hoplites.
To have crossed the Asopos must have
meant annihilation to the army of Pausanias.
He had no cavalry. He had
practically no <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign>, or none worth counting.
Crossing the stream would have
broken the Greek ranks. Once across
the Persian cavalry could have ridden
round and round them on the comparatively
level and open plain. On a
smaller scale the situation would have
anticipated Arbela, with no cavalry, no
light infantry, no developed tactics, no
Alexander, on the Greek side; the issue
would have been the annihilation of the
Greek army, the hot victory of Mardonios.
The Asopos stream was a Rubicon indeed;
the Greek determination to remain
south of it was their salvation; Mardonios
crossed it to his ruin. Had he
crossed on the 12th the result would
have been the same. The Council of
War was only summoned by Pausanias
(and Euryanax) when it became fairly
obvious that the Persian infantry was
not coming across, and that the present

<p>Where is the island to be located?
And how? The measurements given
<pb n="700"/>
by Hdt. are not the most important
evidence in determining the site. His
measurements are only round numbers,
approximative, in decimals. The important
factors are:—(i.) The island was
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ th=s *plataie/wn po/lios</foreign>. (ii.) The island
was formed not by the Asopos, or its
tributaries, but by the Oeroe. These
two factors were, indeed, used by Leake
and Vischer in fixing the island away
to the west, beyond the main road from
Plataia to Thebes. (iii.) The strategic
and tactical necessities of the case must
be met. From this point of view the
objections to Leake's location are overpowering.
On such an island the Greeks
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) would still have been exposed to the
attacks of the Persian cavalry, (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) would
not have been in a better position as
regards supplies. The island must be
sought up on the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>, and it must be
backed by the only remaining pass
through which the Greeks could draw
supplies, viz. the difficult Plataia-Megara
route; and there must be a water-supply.
The position proposed by Dr. Grundy
meets these requirements: (i.) it is in
front of Plataia (and perhaps also Hysiai?);
(ii.) it is formed by the Oeroe; (iii.) it is
inaccessible to cavalry, backed by the
route to Megara, and well supplied with
water (Oeroe, <title>Vergutiani</title> spring); and
also (iv.) accords father better with the
measurements given by Hdt, such as
they are, than the position assigned by
Leake and Vischer. Cp. G. B. Grundy,

have been so exactly the same distance

or in longitude? Is the island 3 stades
long, or 3 stades broad? Unless the
island were a rectangle, a square, it
would seem that it must be its length
that is given, and rectangular it could
not be. On the other hand, a plot of
land only 3 stades long (and probably
not 3 stades wide) would have been far
too small to receive the army. Not
indeed that the whole forces need have
been actually on ‘the island’ in the
strictest sense. Dr. Grundy's island is
considerably less than 3 stades wide,
and indefinitely more than 3 stades
long, but the actual mound might be
about 3 stades long, which is perhaps
what Hdt. would have said, had he
measured, or even seen, the ground
before writing.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="9">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*wero/h</lem></app>. Oeroe is a word of four
syllables, and more than that! ‘The
men of those parts’ in Hdt.'s time
regarded Oeroe as ‘a daughter of Asopos.’
Hdt. need not have gone to Plataia
to learn that. He might have met
an <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixw/rios</foreign> elsewhere. Thersander of
Orchomenos (c. 16 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) might have
been his informant; or he might have
read the statement in a geographical or
mythological work; but it was probably
the last thing a Plataian would have
admitted. What was the sense of calling
Oeroe a daughter of Asopos? Much the
same as of saying that Thebe and Aigina
were daughters of Asopos (cp. 5. 80).
There is policy in it; the Oeroe region
is claimed as part of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*paraswpi/s</foreign> (cp.
c. 15 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). If this myth were intended
for science, the hydrography is against &lt;*&gt;t
Oeroe, the identity of which is certain,
belongs to a different land-system to
that of the Asopos, and sheds its w&lt;*&gt;ers
to the west, down into the bay of
Kreusis, not eastward to the Euboian sea.</p>
<p>The names of rivers are seldom
feminine in Greek. Wesseling remarked
that Oeroe is not included in the twelve
daughters of Asopos by <bibl n="Diod. 4.72">Diodoros 4. 72</bibl>;
cp. <bibl n="Apollod. 3.12">Apollod. 3.11.5</bibl>. Only two of the
names, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*peirh/nh, *)aswpi/s</foreign>, could apply to
springs, or streams. The latter perhaps
might be the Oeroe (but that the Asopos
with twelve daughters is the Phleiasian

<foreign xml:lang="greek">sfe/wn</foreign> out of <foreign xml:lang="greek">sfe/as</foreign>? The material
result, or argument, will be the same in
either case—which perhaps accounts for
the formal ambiguity. The argument
is obscure. <title>A.</title> If Hdt. means that the
cavalry was making frontal attacks upon
the Greeks in their position (II.) ‘on
the Asopos,’ the lie of the land is <foreign rend="ital">prima
facie</foreign> against him. It is not likely that
the cavalry crossed the Asopos in front
of the Greek position, and charged up
the hill, halting and discharging their
missiles, and then retired to a safe
distance; for (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) this would require that
bridges should have been laid across the
river in many places, a proceeding of
which there is no record; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) this frontal
attack would have no connexion with the
destruction of Gargaphia and the watersupply
in rear of the Greek position.
<title>B.</title> If Hdt. means that frontal attacks
by the cavalry were more to be dreaded
than attacks on flank, or on rear (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">kata\
nw/tou</lem></app>), he would be saying what is
manifestly absurd, and in contradiction
with his own context. The frontal
attacks at Erythrai failed; the flank
and rear attacks by the Persian cavalry
upon the Greek positions since the
advance from Erythrai have been successful.
<title>C.</title> Is it possible that <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper katiqu\
e)o/ntwn</foreign> here practically means that the
Greeks were completely surrounded, and
open to direct attack on all sides, though
Hdt. himself may have repeated the
phrase of his authority, or source,
imperfectly and without fully understanding
it? The actual fact was as
suggested. In the position ‘on the
Asopos,’ the position associated with
the Androkrateion and Gargaphia, the
Persian cavalry could attack the Greeks
on all sides, more or less. The destruction
of Gargaphia proves that the
cavalry ranged freely behind the Greek
position; the same fact is proved by the
admission that the Greek connexions were
cut, and that supplies could not reach
them. In such a situation the Greeks
cannot have maintained a formation on
a single front, facing Asopos (north).
The Greek army must necessarily have
formed either in two lines back to back
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">fa/lagc a)mfi/stomos</foreign> Arrian <title>Tact.</title> 29) or
in a hollow square, or parallelogram,
round the Androkrateion; otherwise the
Persian <title>Hippotoxotai</title> would have shot
them down from the rear. (Though the
south side of the ‘Asopos Ridge’ is
steeper than the north slope, it is not
maccessible.) Especially the detachment
told off to guard Gargaphia must have
had such a formation. It is possible
that the expression <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper katiqu\ e)o/ntwn</foreign>
covers these facts. The <title>Nesos</title> was
practically quite inaccessible for cavalry.
<title>D.</title> Last, and least likely: the words
might, ungrammatically, have reference
to the new position about to be taken—
they are in any case more or less
incorrect—or may represent words in
Hdt.'s source originally intended to
mean that in the new position, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/te
katiqu\ e)some/nwn</foreign> (sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)mfote/rwn tw=n
strat</foreign>.), only frontal, and therefore less
formidable, attacks will be possible.
The grammatical obstacle to this interpretation
is threefold: (1) the genitive
absolute remains objectionable, as on
every hypothesis; (2) <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign> has to be
made = <foreign xml:lang="greek">w(/ste, a(/te</foreign>; (3) the present participle
has to be taken as loosely equivalent
to a future participle. These objections,
fatal to this interpretation of the words
as they stand, do not convince me that
the phrase, as originally used by Hdt.'s
authority, may not have had reference
to the new position to be occupied, viz.
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">nh=sos</foreign>.</p></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou\s h(mi/seas a)poste/llein tou= stratope/dou
pro\s to\n *kiqairw=na</lem></app>: a most
curious statement: it was resolved, or
was in a way to be resolved, that after
the whole army had reached the island,
the half of the army should be further
despatched to Kithairon, in order to
convoy, relieve, the attendants who had
gone away to fetch supplies (cp. c. 50
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). Which half of the army was to
be despatched on this service? To what
part of Kithairon was it to go? Was
it really proposed to bisect the army?
One half would have comprised (presumably)
either (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the right wing and right
centre, 22,800 men; or (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the left wing
and left centre, 15,900 men; or (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) the two
wings together, 20,100 men; or (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) the
right and left centre, 18,600 men. Cp.
the tactical disposition and figures as
given and annotated c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> There
is no clear indication which of these four
alternatives is intended. But as in the
sequel the whole centre moves back far
beyond the two wings, while the two
wings attempt to form up in one, though
unsuccessfully, it is best to understand
by <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou(s h(mi/seas</foreign> in this passage the right
and left centre (cp. cc. 52, 69 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign>)
(or else, one half only of the centre?).
The whole plan, then, is apparently that
the two divisions of the centre should
retire <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\s to\n *kiqairw=na</foreign>, while the right
and left wings, i.e. the Lakedaimonians
with the Tegeatai and the Athenians
with the Plataians, should concentrate
back on to the island. To what point on
Kithairon was the centre to retire?
Were they to go back on to the PlataioMegarian
pass, and to protect and
convoy the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)pe/wnes</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">siti/a</foreign> down
the pass, and to the island? The
Persian cavalry was in command and
possession of Dryoskephalai and the
two routes, or passes, therefrom on to
the plain, or the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>. Was the
centre to attempt the recovery, or the
reopening of the loop from ‘Three
Heads’ to Plataia? The centre was to
be detached upon a service apparently
which was the less hazardous; they were
to retire first, they were to retire furthest,
they were to retire in a compact body,
leaving the two wings in the dark to
find or keep touch of each other, and to
concentrate back on to the island, from
their isolated positions at the two extremities
of the existing line. It showed
some confidence in the virtues of the
centre to charge them with that service,
as they might have gone clean off (like
Artabazos on the other side?) from the
battle-field: in the sequel they did
good service. One thing is manifest:

to relate that in the course of their

there, in front of the temple, they
halted, with the utmost precision!
Had they been in ‘flight’ they would
not have stopped there, nor do fugitives
pile arms and take laager: they throw
their arms away, and bolt. The division
which halted (presumably according to

subsequently have had some fighting

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">to\ *(/hraion</lem></app>: the temple of Hera
was in front of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign>, i.e. the Akropolis
of the Plataians, 20 stades from
the fountain of Gargaphia. The site of
the Heraion has been fixed with high
probability by the excavations of Mr.
Henry S. Washington; see <title>Papers of the
American School at Athens,</title> vi. (1897),
pp. 40-54. Its position is almost in
the very centre of the plateau of Plataia,
the southern end of which alone constituted
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis</foreign> even in 429 B.C.
Even at that date there were perhaps
no other buildings on the site. The
restored Plataia of Makedonian, Roman,
and later times covered the whole
plateau, as the extant remains of the
city-walls demonstrate (cp. <title>Papers of
the A.S.A.</title> v. (1892) pp. 253 ff.), and
must have enclosed the <title>Heraion,</title> the
site of which, in 479 B.C., was certainly
outside the city-walls, lower down on
the larger northern portion of the table.
Any one from the north side would
describe the site as <foreign xml:lang="greek">pro\ th=s po/lios</foreign>, and
the Plataians themselves, or any one
following their terminology, would use
the same language (cp. 8. 53), which
would also be not unsuitable from the
point of view of the supposed ‘fugitives’
in this story. It is very doubtful, however
(to my mind), whether the Heraion
was standing in the year 479 B.C., or
even at the time when Hdt. was writing.
The Persians had probably destroyed it
in 480 B.C. (cp. 8. 50). If so, it was in
ruins at the time of the battle. At the
second destruction of Plataia by the
Thebans, in 426 B.C., it is not recorded
that they destroyed the Heraion, but it
is recorded that they built a great inn,
or khan, round a courtyard 200 feet
square (for the reception of pilgrims),
dedicating it and its furniture to Hera,
<cit><quote xml:lang="greek">kai\ new\n e(kato/mpedon li/qinon w)|kodo/mhsan

the very temple (<foreign xml:lang="greek">nao/s</foreign>) which Pausanias

<pb n="707"/>
But though a <title>Hekatompedon,</title> and built
on or over the foundations discovered by
Mr. Washington, the restored temple
was perhaps not so long as the earlier
(sixth century) building, to judge by the
measurements. It is not likely that the
Thebans destroyed a temple which had
been restored since the Persian war; nor is
any account of a temple in such a position
made by Thucydides in his stories of the
siege in 429-7 B.C. Probably the Heraion
had not been restored, but was purposely
left in ruins, as an eternal protest
against the Persian spoiler (and his
Greek allies; hence the Theban restoration
of 426 B.C.). The temple built by
the Plataians out of the spoil of the
battle of 479 B.C. was a temple to
Athene (the Thebans did not destroy
that), Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title> 20, <bibl n="Paus. 9.4.1">Pausan. 9.

no sign of having visited Plataia before

one-quarter of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">mo/ra</foreign>, and there are six
<foreign xml:lang="greek">mo/rai</foreign> in the army, each apparently under

would give a total of 24 <title>Lochoi.</title> In an
army of 5000 that total allows about
292 men to the <title>Lochos.</title> But Xenophon
is writing in the fourth century, when a
Spartan army in the field never approached
a strength of 5000. The
numerical strength of Spartan divisions
varied with the levy probably. The
Spartan <title>Mora</title> destroyed in the Korinthian
war numbered 600 men, Xenoph.
<title>Hell.</title> 4. 5. 11-12. If it consisted of
four <title>Lochoi,</title> the <title>Lochos</title> was numbering
150 men, but there may have been six
<title>Lochoi</title> of 100 men each in it. Thucydides,
writing of the battle of Mantineia (418
B.C.), with the air of an eye-witness,
expressly notices the difficulty of ascertaining
the exact number of men in a
Spartan force. He uses the term <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/xos</foreign>
apparently for the division commanded
by a Polemarch (perhaps only under
exceptional circumstances), and makes
the army of Agis on that occasion
consist of 7 <title>Lochoi,</title> exclusive of the
<title>Skiritai</title> 600 strong. It is obvious that
the <title>Lochos</title> in that passage corresponds
to the <title>Mora</title> of Xenophon, a term not
emp&lt;*&gt;yed by Thucydides (cp.  <title>Hell.</title> 2.
4. &lt;*&gt; earliest case): the number 7
remains a problem, which Arnold in<pb n="709"/>
geniously solves by the hypothesis that
the army really consisted of six divisions,
together with the corps of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*brasi/deioi</foreign> and
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*newdamw/deis</foreign>. (Gilbert, <title>Gr. Staatsalt.</title>
i.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 77, 1893, apparently identifies this
corps with the Skiritai, and gives up the
number of <title>Lochoi</title> as hopeless.) In the
<title>Lochos</title> at Mantineia there were four
<foreign xml:lang="greek">penthkostu/es</foreign>, each consisting in turn of
four <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)nwmoti/ai</foreign>. If the numerical strength
of the <title>Pentekostys</title> necessarily and always
corresponded to its name, that would
give but 200 men to the <title>Lochos,</title> and
(roughly) but 12 to the <title>Enomotia;</title> but
on the possibility of variations in the
numbers of men composing the various
subdivisions, Arnold's note to Thucydides
<foreign rend="ital">in l.</foreign> (of which G. Gilbert, for example,
took no account) is still worth consulting.
The normal number of the <title>Enomotia</title> is
not really quite certain, it may have been
15 (cp. Gilbert, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> 75, n. 4), it may
have been 24, besides the captain, as
Arnold supposes; but it is certain that
the tactical organization of the Spartan
army underwent modification not merely
between the time of Thucydides and of
Xenophon, but between the time of
Herodotos and of Thucydides; nor is it
to be supposed that the indications of
the narrative in Hdt. will correspond
exactly with the traditions of the
Lykurgean system. An army of 5000
men might very well consist of 5 <title>Lochoi</title>
of 1000 men each; and as a matter
of fact 5 is the number of <title>Lochoi</title> suggested
by some of the authorities for the
older period (say, sixth century), cp.
Gilbert, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 76. A <title>Lochos</title> of 1000
men would probably have been subdivided
into 10 companies of 100 each, possibly
‘double <title>Pentekostyes,</title>’ such as Arnold
speaks of (possibly even, though to my
thinking less probably, also called <title>Lochoi</title>
as he suggests). Amompharetos is
emphatically not one of the ‘Polemarchs’
(cp. 7. 173), but may have
been in command of 1000 men. He
was no mere ‘centurion,’ or the story
that follows could hardly have been told
about him.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tou= *pitanhte/wn lo/xou</lem></app>. Thucydides,
still in this respect employing the
same terminology as Hdt., goes out of
his way to assert that it was an error to
say that there was, ‘or ever had been,’
a <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pitana/ths lo/xos</foreign> (&lt;*&gt;. just below) in the
Spartan army, 1. 20. 3. Whether
Thucydides is contraverting the source
from which Hdt. gets this story, or, as
seems likely enough, Hdt. himself, the
express assertion of the Athenian on
this matter is final, if rightly understood.
But what does Thucydides
exactly mean? Not that the Spartan
army was not organized  <foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ lo/xous</foreign>,
for that would contradict his own text
elsewhere, but either that the <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/xoi</foreign>
had not territorial designations, or that
no <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/xos</foreign> derived its designation from
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*pita/nh</foreign> (cp. 3. 55). The recorded names
of <title>Lochoi</title> are territorial, at least in part,
e.g. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*mesoa/ths</foreign> (cp. Gilbert, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 76
n. 3); so that we may conclude in favour
of the latter alternative. If Amompharetos
was a <foreign xml:lang="greek">dhmo/ths</foreign> of Pitana, a
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*pitana/ths</foreign>, and commanded one of the
<title>Lochoi</title> in the Spartan army, an Athenian
source might very probably speak of the
division under his command as the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*pitana/ths lo/xos</foreign>, especially if, as above
argued, the family of this Pitanate was
likely to be known and popular in
Athens.</p>
<p>Hdt. himself calls <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pita/nh</foreign> a <foreign xml:lang="greek">dh=mos</foreign>,
rather an Atticism than a Laconism, 3.
55. Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 3.16.9">3. 16. 9</bibl>) seems to put
Pitane and Mesoa in juxtaposition (<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(</foreign>)
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)k *meso/as te kai\ *pita/nhs qu/ontes th=|
*)artemi/di</foreign>: and the mistake censured by
Thucydides may lie in calling the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*mesoa/ths lo/xos</foreign> the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pitana/ths</foreign>. Pitana
itself was evidently a considerable place:
Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 3.14.2">3. 14. 2</bibl>) mentions a <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/sxh
*krotanw=n</foreign> in the vicinity of the Royal
Tombs of the Agiadai, adding <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)si\ de\ oi(
*krotanoi\ *pitanatw=n moi=ra</foreign>. This makes
Pitane in the west end of Sparta: the
Artemis above named is Artemis Issoria,
Pausan. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> (cp. Wide, <title>Lakonische Kulte,</title>
1893, p. 109). Close by were the tombs
of Leonidas and Pausanias the Regent,
and the monument to the 300 who fell
at Thermopylai (cp. 7. 224).</p>
<p>The story of Amompharetos may well
belong to the first draft of Hdt.'s work.
It is a superficial inference that Hdt.
got this story of Amompharetos in
Pitane, during his visit to Sparta: the
story is plainly not a Spartan story, it is
almost as plainly an Athenian. There
is nothing in the story to show that
<pb n="710"/>
Hdt. had been in Sparta before writing
it down, rather the reverse. If Hdt.
afterwards made friends in Pitane it was
perhaps because he took introductions
from Athens; but he either did not
discover his mistake about the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*pitana/ths
lo/xos</foreign>, or he failed to correct it. If the
emperor Caracalla (211-217 A.D.) before

the Council of War in cc. 50 f. <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The

there was any fresh council or discussion
now taking place. If Amompharetos was
really absent from the previous Council
it was not because he was not a sufficiently
high officer to be present, but for some
other reason. Stein suggests that he
was in command of an important outpost;
but which? And had he retired
from it? The army had been <foreign rend="ital">ex

How also does Amompharetos
now come to be back in the Laager? A
statement of this sort, explanatory or
rather assertorial of his absence from
the Council, is very suspicions; it is
argumentative, and apologetic, to meet
the obvious objection to the story, that
Amompharetos must have known all
about the intended movement from
having been present at the Council
earlier in the day. (It is just conceivable
that a Spartan <title>Lochos,</title> under
Amompharetos, or some other, might
have been posted in or about the church
of St. Demetrion; but the position
would have been a dangerously isolated
one, as the detachment could not have
kept touch of the forces on the Asopos
Ridge, with the Persian cavalry riding
up and down the valleys or combes
between the ridges; or he might have
been holding or trying to hold Gargaphia:
in which case he had retired before the
strangers already.)</p></div>

It would be unfair to Hdt. to cite him
as endorsing or accepting even, as his
own, the utterance of Athenian prejudice
which follows: to wit, that Lakedaimonians
were men who thought one
thing and said another, men whose
words, agreements, promises, pledges,
could not be relied on as representing
their intentions, much less their conduct,
when the time for action arrived.</p>
<p>Lakedaimonian perfidy was a popular
topic at Athens: Aristophanes (who
had another axe to grind) satirizes the
commonplace, cp. <title>Acharn.</title> 300 ff., <title>Peace</title>
1063 ff. Blakesley compared the Roman
view of <title>Punica fides</title> and continental
opinion of ‘perfidious Albion’: one
might perhaps add Albion's opinion of
certain continental states. Rawlinson
more innocently observed that the soreness
caused by recent disappointment
(in 479 B.C.) might have produced, at
Athens, a distrust of the Spartans.
Stein's observation that Hdt. in this
passage stands <foreign rend="ital">ganz auf athenischer Seite</foreign>
is more to the point, but hardly carries
us quite far enough. Hdt. himself is
probably as innocent as Rawlinson in
the matter; but if the Athenian story

They cannot trust the Spartan's word,
but they are ready to obey the Spartan's
orders! It is as though, in some way
or other, the Spartans would take a
mean advantage of the Athenians, in
getting these to go, while they themselves
remained at their post! That is
an idea belonging to the Athenian theory
of the Persian war, which represented
it as a race between Athens and Sparta,
which should first crush out the invader
—a race in which Marathon for ever
secured the prize of valour for Athens!
(Cp. Hdt. IV.-VI. vol. ii. p. 194.)</p>
<p>Perhaps this (mounted man) episode
is only a reply to, or refutation of, the
(Spartan) assertion that in the stress of
battle the Spartans had sent to ask for
assistance, which the Athenians failed
to render, c. 60 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> If there is any
truth in it, that truth may underlie the
question <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ xreo\n ei)/h poie/ein</foreign>, ‘what are
we to do?’ The Athenians were in
difficulties, but not on account of the
retreat of the centre, if it be true that a
general retreat had been agreed on, and
ordered; for they could not yet know
that the centre had not retreated but
fled (even if that was true!). But in
what difficulties were the Athenians?
Perhaps the message was to the effect
that the centre was retreating so slowly
that the Athenians had not yet been
able to start, and to request Pausanias to
hurry the centre's movements. Cp. l. 14.</p></div></div>

<p>There has, therefore, been a turn, a
wheel, in the line, in the orientation of
the Athenians. Whether there has also
been a turn in the orientation of the
Lakedaimonians Hdt. does not say.
What amount of wheel would constitute
or justify the use of <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ e)/mpalin</foreign> may be
a question; the words obviously might
be used of a movement, or double movement,
much short of being in contrary
directions. In the present case Hdt.
need not mean that Athenians and
Spartans were moving in diametrically
opposite directions, starting, as it were,
back to back; he may mean no more
than that ‘they were moving in anything
but the same direction.’ Whether
he is right or not is a widely different
question. If Spartans and Athenians
were under orders to fill up the gap and
concentrate, while at the same time retiring,
‘on the Island,’ that movement
might have been effected by the wings
falling back, <title>Lochos</title> by <title>Lochos,</title> from the
east and the west ends of the previous
line to a eommon point south, or southwest,
of the position at starting; and even
such a manœuvre, with reference to the
<foreign rend="ital">termini a quibus,</foreign> might be described as
movements <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ e)/mpalin</foreign>. But the movement
here predicated of the Athenians
may go far beyond this. By <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ pedi/on</foreign>
might be understood not merely the
trough of Gargaphia and A<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, but the
more genuine plain north of Plataia. If
so, the movement of the Athenians was
westward, more or less by south, and its
object may have been to balk the
approach of the medizing Greeks on the
Persian right, with whom the Athenians
are presently engaged. Had the Greeks
previously been in a hollow square, or
with a <foreign xml:lang="greek">fa/lagc a)mfi/stomos</foreign> round the
church of St. John (Androkrateion), then
the Athenians, to the north, might have
wheeled round, till they were facing
west, or even south-west, while the
Spartans may have either remained,
facing south (by west) as they had been
all the previous day, or may even have
turned, have been obliged to turn, until
they were facing east, or north-cast.</p></div>

No ancient authority clearly indicates
the right identification; modern travellers
and commentators are divided on
the subject. Thus the Moloeis has been
identified with O<hi rend="sup">1</hi> (so by Vischer, p. 547,
cp. Bursian, <title>Geogr. v. Griechenl.</title> i. 247),
while Dr. Grundy, who adopted A<hi rend="sup">5</hi> in
his <title>Topography of the Battle of Plataia,</title>
1894, p. 33, in his <title>Great Persian War,</title>
1901, p. 495, now prefers A<hi rend="sup">6</hi>. These
(O<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, A<hi rend="sup">6</hi>) are respectively the two most
considerable affluents, the one of Oeroë,
the other of Asopos; <title>Ridge 2,</title> forming
the watershed east and west, lies between
them. Thus, as far as the R Moloeis
<pb n="717"/>
goes, the geographical indication comes
to much the same thing, and might
point to Ridge 2 as the halting-place of
Pausanias.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="8">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*)argio/pio/n te xw=ron kaleo/menon</lem></app>.
The <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)argio/pios xw=ros</foreign>, possibly <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ *)argio/pion</foreign>,
is not elsewhere mentioned. A
nymph Argiope is known to Pausanias
(<bibl n="Paus. 4.33.3">4. 33. 3</bibl>), but she belongs to Parnassos,
not to Kithairon: more in place here
were Argiope, wife of Agenor, and
mother of Kadmos; Pherekydes, <title>Frag.</title>
40. She is a water-nymph, for she is a
daughter of Neilos: her name should
perhaps be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)agrio/ph</foreign> rather than <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)argio/ph</foreign>.
(Cp. Hyginus, <title>Fab.</title> vi. ed. Th. Muncker,
1681.) In any case, the Argiopion
rather leans towards Oeroe. The attempt
to connect the ‘place’ with a
‘White Rock’ (W. Irving Hunt, <title>Papers
of Am. Sch. at Athens,</title> v. 1892, p. 276)
is not satisfactory; cp. Grundy, p. 495;
nor need Pape now be cited as authority
for that etymological effort. Dr. Grundy
was divided (in 1894) between ‘Long
Ridge’ and ‘Plateau’; he has now
decided for the latter. But Ridge 2,
the watershed between Oeroe and his
own Moloeis, has clearly as good a right
as either.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*dh/mhtros *)eleusini/hs i(ro/n</lem></app>. One
of the indications, which make it difficult
to believe that Hdt. had been over the
ground, is the fact that there were at
least two temples of Eleusinian Demeter
within the area of the operations he is
describing, viz. (1) at Plataia, <bibl n="Paus. 9.4.2">Pausanias
9. 4. 2</bibl>; (2) at Hysiai, <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 11">Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title>
11</bibl>. To these Dr. Grundy adds (3) one
at Erythrai, on the strength of the
discovery of inscribed stones on the
traditional site of Erythrai, <title>Topography</title>
(1894), p. 34. (The <foreign xml:lang="greek">nao/s</foreign> at Skolos,
<bibl n="Paus. 9.4.3">Pausan. 9. 4. 3</bibl>, and the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/lsos</foreign> at Potniai,
<bibl n="Paus. 9.9.1">Pausan. 9. 9. 1</bibl>, which would raise the
<title>Demetria</title> to five in number, may be
ignored for present purposes.) Of these
three temples, the Plataian, if it were
inside the city, on no possible theory of
the battle could be employed to define
the position of the Spartans; nor would
a site in Plataia in any sense accord with
the other indications so far as they have
been provisionally identified above, viz.
the river Moloeis and the Argiopion, or
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*)argio/pios xw=ros</foreign>. But if it were outside
the city, though in Plataian territory,
the case would be altered. See further,
below.</p>
<p>The third, the Erythraian <title>Demetrion,</title>
was located high up the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>, considerably
more than 10 stades from
either Gargaphia, and, what is still more
against it, would indicate that the
Spartans were making back to Erythrai,
and to the first position (I<hi rend="sup">A</hi>), from which
they had advanced originally, and where
the Greeks had been especially open to
attack from the Persian cavalry, and
also in want of water. These considerations
rule out the Erythraian shrme in
this place.</p>
<p>There remains the Hysiatan, which,
from the position of Hysiai and its
territory, would necessarily in some
sense lie between the Demetrion of
Plataia west, and that of Erythrai east.
Such a position obviously suits the
general requirements of the story, as
well as the provisional identifications of
the Argiopion and the river Moloeis
above. The question remains of the exact
site of the Hysiatan Demetrion. Was it
actually in the town of Hysiai, i.e. high
up on the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>, in front of the middle
pass, on the road from Plataia to Athens,
where it entered the mountain; or was
it lower down the slopes, in Hysiatan
&lt;*&gt;</p>
<p>Plutarch, <bibl n="Plut. Arist. 11"><title>Arist.</title> 11</bibl>, describes it as <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n
*(usiw=n plhsi/on, u(po\ to\n *kiqairw=na</foreign>. It
was near Hysiai, therefore, not inside
Hysiai; it was ‘close under Kithairon’
—a description which might be applied
to any spot south of Asopos, especially
by a visitor coming from the north
(Thebes or Chaironeia). It is not
probable that there were two temples
of Eleusinian Demeter in the Hysiatis.
If then, as Dr. Grundy has ingeniously
suggested (<title>Topography,</title> p. 33; <title>Persian
War,</title> pp. 495 f.), the modern church of St.
Demetrion marks the site of an ancient
temple of Demeter, that would be the
Hysiatan Demetrion, outside and to the
north below the city.</p>
<p>But this identification will not suit
at all either Plutarch or Herodotus.
In Plutarch the Demetrion marks
the position near Hysiai to which the
Athenians advanced in the first instance,
a position high up on the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign> and
<pb n="718"/>
nowhere near the church of St.
Demetrion. In Hdt. the Demetrion
here marks the position to which the
Spartans retreated, 10 stades back, from
Gargaphia: that might very well coin
cide with the original position of the
Athenians on the extreme left of the
Greek position, which was now become
the extreme right of the position; but
it is nowhere near the church of St.
Demetrion. Thus, if Dr. Grundy is
right, Plutarch and Hdt. are wrong in
relation to the Demetrion.</p>
<p>Mr. W. Irving Hunt, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> p. 276,
places the Plataian Demetrion “on high
ground south-east of Plataia at a point
where are now the foundations of a large
Byzantine church.” He further defines
the position as “about six minutes' walk
east of the spring Vergoutiani.” This
position might do for the Plataian
Demetrion, but Plutarch professes to be
dealing with the Hysiatan; Mr. Hunt
has not marked the difference. It
appears to me that Dr. Grundy has
really hit upon the position of the
Hysiatan Eleusinion; but that it was the
Plataian Eleusinion (if Mr. Hunt is
right in regard to its site), of which
Plutarch onght to have spoken in that
passage, and Hdt. in this. It is quite
obvious that if the church of St.
Demetrion marks the site of the Hysiatan
Demetrion, that site, and that edifice, can
have nothing to say to the former
position of the Athenians (Plutarch) nor
to the latter position of the Lakedaimonians
(Hdt.). The wonder recorded
by Hdt., c 62 below, if occurring
in the Persian rout, however, might
suit with the site of the church. The
cause of all the confusion is Hdt.'s
ignorance that there could be more
than one Demetrion in question. By a
somewhat unusual infelicity Hdt. here
applies <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">i(drume/non</lem></app> to the army (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sti=fos</foreign>)
and nses the term <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">h(=stai</lem></app> of the temple
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ro/n</foreign>). <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(me/non</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">kathme/non</foreign> of the army,
<foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/drustai</foreign> of the temple, would have been
more natural. Buttmann (<foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign> Baehr)
even said that <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(=sqai</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(/drusqai</foreign> was
inadmissible: cp. c. 51 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">perisxi/zetai
r(e/ousa</foreign>). (If <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(drume/non</foreign> was to be used of
the man, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(me/non</foreign> of the temple,
Amompharetos, rather than Pausanias,
would seem to be the proper man. As
far as the word goes it might here agree,
not with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/</foreign> (sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ a)/llo sti=fos</foreign>) but with
<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n *)amomfare/tou lo/xon</foreign>, in which case it
would be easier to identify the Demetrion
with the church of Demetrion. But
the argument demands that Pausanias'
position should be the one described;
the position of Amompharetos is <foreign rend="ital">ex
hypothesi</foreign> near Gargaphia, and this
would be a curiously late point at which
to be describing it; cp. c. 53 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>)</p></div>

likely to be true (in accordance with a

than the reason given for the fact, the
motivation. The statement here made
that, if only Amompharetos had carried
his obstinate insubordination a little
further, Pausanias would have yielded
and returned to support him, is very
little short of absurd. The obvious
hypothesis is that Amompharetos, like
every other good Spartan, was strictly
obeying orders; that his <foreign xml:lang="greek">lo/xos</foreign> was the

told off to cover the movement backwards.
The words <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n tw=| e)teta/xato o( *)am.

higher ground. How can the whole
cavalry be attacking them? The vagueness
of the statement is further exhibited
by what immediately follows. Hdt.
says that in thus attacking them the

In c. 40 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> a similar generalization

<p>How the Persians got across the
Asopos Hdt. does not specify; it cannot
have been all boarded over; there may
have been some bridges, or planks, in
use; but for all that appears they
scrambled across as best they could.
The passage of the Asopos, which they
had steadily declined, so long as the
Greeks were in battle-array on the
other side, is now undertaken apparently
under the idea that the Greeks are in
full retreat, perhaps for their several
homes; the extreme left wing is invisible
to Mardonios. He may even believe
that it has made good its escape; at
least he may safely leave it to the
tender mercies of the Thebans and his
own right. He sights easily enough
the glint of Greek weapons at the
Heraion, and up beyond, in the gap of
the road to Megara, in the gap of the
road to Athens; while in the nearer
foreground are the Spartans, with their
commander, apparently in full retreat,
and isolated from the other Greek
divisions. His cavalry is riding unopposed
up the road to Erythrai, as it
has been free to do ever since the Greek
deployed from that position.</p></div>

the idea in the minds of the Persians,

<p>The motivation is here to be accepted
not so much on the ground that Greeks
in the Persian ranks, or Persian sources
themselves, might afterwards have reported
Mardonios' motives to that effect;
but rather on the ground that to obtain
a satisfactory theory of the battle, we
must suppose that the object, or a part
of the object of the Greeks, in retiring,
was to entice Mardonios across the river,
in effecting which object the Greek
commanders will have given their movement
as much as possible the appearance
of a ‘flight.’</p></div>

may rather be taken with the verb <foreign xml:lang="greek">h)/isan</foreign>
repeated, or understood from the context.
We are there, however, on the Greek
side, here with the Persians; and it
by no means follows that the action of
the Persians, as here recorded, was not

adduce (with Ross and Baehr) this statement,
perhaps in itself true enough, as
evidence that Hdt. had with his own
eyes inspected the battle-field, is a fine
instance of half-methods. The statement
is a clear example of the dialectical
production or evolution of tradition.
Why did not Mardonios attend to the
Athenians? Because he could not see
them. Why could he not see them?
By reason of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/xqoi</foreign>—and so forth.
The statement may, of course, have
come to Hdt. ready made in his source.
Though perhaps true, it is not an
adequate explanation of the Persian
general's action, for he was bound to
acquaint himself at once with the proceedings
of the Greek left wing; and
what were the Aleuadai about to receive

<p>Perhaps two or three things had

had been drawn across the Asopos in
disorder, and were now massed, at
short range, behind the feeble barrier of
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ge/rra</foreign>, like sheep for the slaughter,

temple of Demeter; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the Persian
cavalry was, perhaps, far off, or quite

so far as the road in the rear was concerned,
by the right centre in the

(<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) from the left came word, or sign,
that there was nothing to fear in that

<p>(Blakesley long ago (1854) boldly said

the whole army of the enemy to action
at close quarters: “the problem for
Pausanias was to keep his troops perfectly

would no longer have it in their power

<pb n="733"/>
‘third’ Messenian war (464-454 B.C.).
The reference is obscure. Hdt. does not
clearly indieate that the war is between
the Lakedaimonians and Messenians; he
does not describe the character or nature
of the corps of 300 men under Aeimnestos;
he does not say on which side
Aeimnestos was fighting; he gives no
details or circumstances in regard to
the engagement. This is, in short, one
of the obscurest references to contemporary
events in the whole work. Hdt.,
however, does not say that Aeimnestos
was a Spartan, nor that the men under
his command were Spartans. Blakesley
says: “no doubt Aeimnestos commanded
the garrison which was intended to maintain
military possession of the country.”
But that seems to me very doubtful:
how came a Plataian by such an appointment?

and the fort (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tei=xos</foreign>) were continnous;
the camp was on the left (north) bank
of the Asopos, along the road from
Erythrai to Thebes; the fortified portion
of the camp may have been projected
across the river on to the south bank,
so that a part of the river flowed right
through the fortification, or at least a
<foreign rend="ital">tête de pont</foreign> may have been fortified to
the south of the river on the said road.
This <foreign xml:lang="greek">tei=xos</foreign> was an <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ruma</foreign> to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">strato/s</foreign>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">qw=ma de/ moi</lem></app>: the cause of this
marvel Hdt. explains just below as a
direct divine interposition to bring about
the given result. On the supposition
that the Demetrion in question is marked
by the church of St. Demetrion Dr.
Grundy explains the fact by the lie of
the ground: the Persians in rushing back
to their laager and camp would naturally
avoid the delay of climbing up the hill,
on the top of which the Demetrion was
sitnate, and would naturally rush along
the lower slopes and stream valleys (A<hi rend="sup">4</hi>,
A<hi rend="sup">5</hi>) either side the ‘Long Ridge.’ This
plansible suggestion remains equally
valid whether the routed fugitives were
mounted or on foot. But it is possible
that Mardonios himself had occupied
this hill during the battle, in order to
survey the action; and Hdt. (or his
source) would have had small excuse
for wonder if the area had not been
within the field of battle. At an earlier
stage in the proceedings the Demetrion
may have been held by the Spartans
(Amompharetos? cp. c. 53 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>). Hdt.

<p>The <foreign rend="ital">asyndeton</foreign> which follows may
help to mark the laboured character of
the apology for Artabazos, which is far
from coherent or close in its argument.
As Stein points out, Hdt. (or rather,
perhaps, his source) is anxious to explain
and justify the treacherous conduct of
Artabazos; while Blakesley regards the
difficulty as arising from an “Hellenic
interpretation” of a proceeding which
the Greeks did not understand: he even
accepts the suggestion of 8. 126 that the
reputation of Artabazos was raised by
his conduct at Plataia, that is, the skill
with which he brought off his division.
It is quite possible that the action,
position, and proceedings of Artabazos
have not been correctly envisaged by
Greek tradition, and that, imperfect
information having created a problem,
apologetics were called in to reconcile
the facts of the subsequent career of
Artabazos with his supposed conduct at
Plataia. But if Artabazos was really at
Plataia with 40,000 men, no amount of
insight or foresight, of wit or wisdom,
could conceal or excuse his shameful
treachery to Mardonios, and thereby to
the Persian cause. However, the Greek
idea that he was in Boiotia, or within
reach of Mardonios at the time of the
battle, may be erroneous. It is this idea
which creates the problem.</p></div>
<div type="commline" n="6">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">ei)=xe</lem></app>, ‘was in command of . .’
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">du/namin</lem></app>, cp. 4. 155. The 40,000 men of
this passage may be reconciled with the
60,000 of 8. 126 by the supposition
that Artabazos had lost 20,000 in the
siege of Poteidaia and his other operations;
but the harmony is our own
doing. We are in the presence of more
or less independent stories, and, it may
be, of independent estimates of the
numbers under Artabazos' command.
Each figure represents a division of
50,000, or one-sixth of the Grand Army;
but, perhaps, in the one case a myriad
of cavalry has been added, and in the
other case subtracted, or not included.
The position assigned to Artabazos in
tradition makes him only a little inferior
to Mardonios, and discounts the larger
estimate for the latter's army. Moreover,
40,000 is just about the figure
for the Makedonian and Hellenic contingent,
minus the Thebans (cp. next c.),
a coincidence which suggests that, if
present at the battle of Plataia, he
was in command of the right wing,
including the Makedonians, medizing
Greeks, etc. Their attitude and conduct
may help to explain his.</p></div>

so much by the valour of the Athenians,
as by the victory of the Spartans over

Korinthians and those with them,’ and
plainly covers ‘the right centre’ as
enumerated in c. 28 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> comprising
some 11,300 hoplites, in six (or eight)
divisions, from the Korinthians on the
extreme left (next the Lakedaimonians
and Tegeatai) to the Mykenaians and
Tirynthians on the right, i.e. just at
the very middle of the Greek line.</p>
<p>This body, the right centre, is here
dimly reported as betaking itself from
the Heraion, where it had been duly
disposed and drawn up in order (of
battle), through, or over, the skirts of
the mountain and the ridgeland, by
the way leading up to the temple of
Demeter.</p>
<p>This notice at first sight suggests that
they are going to the help of Pausanias
in the position of the Lakedaimonians
as described in cc. 56, 57 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> But
Pansanias is <foreign rend="ital">ex hypothesi</foreign> already
victorious, and does not need their
assistance; and in fact nothing more is
heard of this body of men and their
ill-starred movement, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou)de/na ko/smon

any orders</p>
<p>There is the same ambiguity here as
elsewhere in regard to the exact extent
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(pwre/h</foreign>, in regard to the identity
of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kolwnoi/</foreign>, in regard to the precise
one of three Demetria which may have
been involved in the movement; perhaps
also as to the exact point of time at
which this movement of the right centre
took place. It is curious, too, that no
message reaches this body of men
summoning them (like the Athenians
c. 60 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) to the aid of Pausanias.
(But cp. note to c. 61. 14 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>) The
precise sequence and chronology of the
orders, messages, movements in various
parts of the field of battle are not coherently
presented by Hdt. Perhaps the
division of the Greek army forming the
right centre had been detached and
deployed on to the road from Plataia to
Athens (Dryoskephalai) for the purpose
of holding it against the Persian cavalry,
and was actually so engaged, while the
Lakedaimonians were resisting the onset
of the Persian infantry, lower down the
slope, or had even already put the
Persians to flight. In any case the line
of march here indicated for the right
centre is uphill from Plataia, and its
objective cannot be marked by the
present church of St. Demetrion, the
site of which is far below the Heraion.</p>

outstrip its pursuers. But were not a

of the fortification? And the pursuers
were also retarded by the slaughter,

instances the failures of the Spartans
to subdue Eira, Ithome, Pylos: the story
of the siege of Plataia (429-7 B.C.) is no
less eminent a case. But the Athenians
were not so very much better: the siege
of Poteidaia lasted two years (432-30
B.C.); no assault on Syracuse occurred
during the Athenian siege (414-13 B.C.).
The defence of stone walls had always
the advantage, in the absence of heavy
machines and engines: fire or starvation
were the chief hopes of the besiegers
(cp. Thucydides, his essay in Poliorketios
2. 75-78). The Athenian reputation
was more or less established at the time
of the third Messenian war (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.102.2">Thuc. 1.
102. 2</bibl>), aud may have been enhanced in
the assaults on Samos (440-39 B.C.)
where some engines were perhaps employed,
without much success (Plutarch,
<pb n="743"/>
<title>Perikles</title> 27, cp. <bibl n="Diod. 12.28.3">Diodor. 12. 28. 3</bibl>; the
authority was merely Ephoros, and it is
clear that the city was not captured by
force); but it looks as if their reputation
was based rather on the defensive aptitude
of their own city, long walls, and
fortified harbour than on the brilliance
of their record in assaulting others.
The Lakedaimonians not having any

existed in Hdt.'s day was burnt down
in the year 395-4 B.C., and the splendid
temple described by <bibl n="Paus. 8.45">Pausanias 8. 45</bibl> ff.
was a later edifice; but, though it still
contained the fetters of the Spartans
(<bibl n="Paus. 8.47.2">8. 47. 2</bibl>), Pausanias makes no mention
of the manger of Mardonios. If the
Tegeatai really found the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fa/tnh tw=n
i(/ppwn</foreign> in the <foreign xml:lang="greek">skh/nh</foreign> of Mardonios, the
white charger (c. 63 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) must have
been stabled in rather close proximity
to his rider's quarters. On the further

<p><title>Alea</title> as a title of Athene is perhaps to
be connected with the Arkadian town of
the same name mentioned by Pausanias
<pb n="744"/>
(<bibl n="Paus. 8.23.1">8. 23. 1</bibl>), containing a sanctuary of
Athene Alea, a goddess worshipped also
in Mantineia (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> 8. 9. 6). The cult
was not confined actually to historic
Arcadia; Pausanias saw a wooden image
of Athene Alea on the road from Sparta
to Therapne (<bibl n="Paus. 3.19.7">3. 19. 7</bibl>), and Xenophon
(<title>Hell</title> 6. 5. 27) mentions a <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ero\n th=s
*)ale/as</foreign> apparently in the same place at
the time of the first Theban invasion
of Lakonia (369 B.C). Tegea was undoubtedly
the most important centre of
the cult in historic times; ‘Aleus’ was
reckoned the city's founder (<bibl n="Paus. 8.45.1">Pausan.
8. 45. 1</bibl>), but Pausanias seems to distinguish
clearly between the sanctuary
of Athene Poliatis at Tegea and that of
Athene Alea (<foreign rend="ital">ib.</foreign> 8. 47. 5).</p></div>

6. 137, 7. 24, etc., ‘it was in their
power . .’ The ‘many myriads’ are
immediately precised as 30-4 = 260,000
units, of whom less than 3000 survive!
Such butchery is practically inconceivable.
If we accept 3000 as about the
number of the survivors, the figures for
Mardonios' forces would have to be indefinitely
reduced; but the one extreme
is hardly more to be trusted than the
other. It is observable that the <foreign rend="ital">corps
d'armée</foreign> under Artabazos is here again
included strictly in the original total
of Mardonios' army, consistently with
8. 126; but this involves Hdt. in an
inconsistency, for he here seems to take
no account of the fact that Artabazos
had started with 60,000. He also seems
to allow nothing for the losses in previous
skirmishes. Hdt.'s statement is tantamount
to saying that 99 per cent
were slain, for of (300,000-40,000) only
(3000-<foreign rend="ital">x</foreign>) escaped. The estimate might
be rationalized down to meaning that
of the 300,000 men, taken by Hdt. as
the estimate of the forces left with
Mardonios, and still acceptable as an
estimate for the total land-forces of
Xerxes (<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s *ce/rcew</foreign> c. 69 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), only
43,000 returned to Asia from the
campaign of 479 B.C. If that was
less than half the forces entrusted to
Mardonios and Artabazos the losses
would still have been enormous, and
might justify Aischylos and his ‘heaps
of corpses’ (<foreign xml:lang="greek">qi=nes de\ nekrw=n</foreign> <title>Pers.</title> 821 ff).
<bibl n="Diod. 11.32">Diodoros 11. 32</bibl> puts the Persian losses
in the battle of Plataia at upwards
of 100,000 (probably only Ephoros'
rationalism); Ktesias 26 the Persian
losses from Salamis to Plataia at 120,000.</p>

a remarkable periphrasis for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*spartihte/wn</foreign>.
No account is taken apparently of the
Perioikoi, much less of mere Helots; cp.
c. 85 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> The figures which follow
have a precise and an authentic air,
but apparently refer merely to those
who fell in the final and decisive
engagement (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n th=| sumbolh=|</foreign>) of the
thirteenth day. In c. 61 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">polloi/</foreign>
have been killed, and in c. 63 the
Persians <foreign xml:lang="greek">kate/ballon pollou\s tw=n *lakedaimoni)wn</foreign>—here
only 91 ‘Spartiates’ are
accounted for ‘in all’ (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">oi( pa/ntes</lem></app>). The
proportionate losses are interesting: the
Spartans lose not quite 2 per cent (91
out of 5000); the Tegeatai just over
1 per cent (16 out of 1500); the
Athenians considerably under 1 per cent
(52 out of 8000); the totals, however,
are only nominal, especially for the last
engagement. No account at all is taken
of the right and left centre, to say
nothing of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">yiloi/</foreign>, such as they were.
Plutarch (<title>Aristeid.</title> 19) gives the snm
total (<foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( pa/ntes</foreign>) of those who fell upon
this occasion as 1360, whereas the figures
here amount to 159 only. Plutarch
adds, on the authority of Kleidemos,
the curious statement that the 52
Athenians were all of one tribe, the
Aiantis. If 52 Athenians of one tribe
had been slain, we might have to
multiply roughly by ten to reach the
sum total, though one or other tribe of
course might have been specially hard
hit on the occasion. At Marathon 192
Athenians were admitted to have fallen
(6. 117), considerably more than the
total loss here reported for Plataia.
There is something radically wrong in
these figures, though doubtless they
repose on some monuments, or inscriptions,
carelessly copied, or misunderstood.</p></div></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">h)ri/steuse de/ ktl.</lem></app> There should
follow here the record of the formal
<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)risth/ia</foreign>, or awards of valour; as in 8.
11, 17 for Artemision, in 8. 93, 123 for
Salamis etc., and in c. 105 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> for
Mykale. But the record here is not of
any formal and express award, for (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>)
the merits of the barbarians are included
(cp. however 8. 17); (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) Hdt. himself
expressly indicates that he has no official
authority for his awards. There is in
fact here a <foreign rend="ital">casus omissus,</foreign> which generates
a problem, for assuredly Greeks failed not
in the case of Plataia to discuss and award
the <title>Aristeia,</title> as for the other battles of
the war; nor is it credible that Hdt.
should unwittingly have passed over
the record, or tradition, of the formal
award: he must have omitted it deliberately.
Plutarch (<title>Aristeid.</title> 20 and <foreign rend="ital">de
malign. Hdti</foreign> 42, 10 = <title>Mor.</title> 873) makes
good the omission. The Athenians and
Spartans nearly came to blows over the
question of the award (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ a)ristei=on</foreign>): the
question was referred to the confederates.
Theogeiton of Megara suggested the
award of the prize to some third city,
Kleokritos of Korinth proposed that
Plataia should be that city, Aristeides
at once accepted the suggestion on behalf
of Athens, and Pausanias on behalf
of Lakedaimon. Eighty talents were
assigned to the Plataians, out of which
they built the temple of Athene, which
was still up-standing in the days of
Plutarch (cp. note to c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>): the
Lakedaimonians, however, erected a
trophy on their own account, and the
Athenians one likewise separately. This
story has intrinsic probability, and the
chief argument against it is the silence
of Hdt. here, and the silence of Thucydides
in the Plataian Apology, 3. 53-59.
But the <foreign rend="ital">argumentum e silentio</foreign> seldom is
conclusive. The story in question was
little to the credit either of Sparta or of
Athens, and was probably a sore subject
at both places. The Athenian Thucydides
may have ignored it from patriotism, or
<pb n="746"/>
made his dramatic mouthpiece ignore it
from fact. It is harder to explain the
silence or the ignorance of Hdt.: he takes
part definitely with the Lakedaimonians:
has he deliberately suppressed the story
in the Lakedaimonian interest? It does
not help us in this connexion to infer
(with Grote and Rawlinson) that no
formal decision was made; their inference
eases the Thucydidean problem, but not
the Herodotean: our author was bound
to have told the story of the dispute,
even if there was no formal award. He
prefers to divide the honours of the day
between the Koryphaioi (6. 98), for
Plataia to Lakedaimon, for Mykale to
Athens. Pindar, <title>Pyth.</title> 1. 77, hints
that Plataia was a Spartan victory;
<bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 816">Aischylos, <title>Pers.</title> 816 f.</bibl>, might seem to
recognize the claims of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dwri\s lo/gxh</foreign>,
and <bibl n="Diod. 11.33.1">Diodoros 11. 33. 1</bibl> records a definite
award to Sparta and to Pausanias (cp.
c. 64 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); but Attic prejudice is
most fully represented in the <title>Menexenos</title>
240 f. where <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ a/ristei=a tw=| lo/gw|</foreign> are

third place, and of the respective credit
of the two states the speaker is discreetly
silent. This may represent an early,
the earliest, Attic tendency. Nothing
other states might do should ever be
admitted to have eclipsed ‘the trophies
of Miltiades’! The legend of Marathon
had ten years' start of the story of

the passive virtues, and even the passive
states of active virtues (e.g. courage)
were less highly esteemed in Sparta
than with us. The name Kallikrates
is not an uncommon one. Plutarch,
<title>Agesilaos</title> 35, mentions a Spartan of his
own time so named, a descendant of the
man, Antikrates, who had dealt Epameinondas
his death blow. Who would
not fain believe that Kallikratidas, the
typical Spartan of the old school
(Xenophon, <title>Hell.</title> 1. 6. 1-36) towards
the eud of the fifth century, was a
relative of the Plataian hero, who was

Helena, a lovely girl of ten years, as she

During his absence (to help Peirithous

According to the one, Sophanes
used to carry, slung (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">dedeme/nhn e)k</lem></app>) from
the belt of his cuirass on a bronze chain,
an iron auchor; this he would throw,
when he approached the enemy (and it
would, no doubt, stick in the ground),
in such a way that the enemy could not
make him budge, though they might
charge him; then, when the adversaries
were put to flight, his plan was to pick
up his anchor and so be after them.</p>
<p>This is not a very credible story, and
it is contradicted by the other.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) He had upon his shield an anchor
as a device, or emblem; and his shield
was in perpetual motion, never at rest.
In which case there was a contrast
between the man's emblem and his
action.</p>
<p>It is possible that the latter and
simpler story was at the root of the

Stein identifies this disaster with the
defeat recorded by Thucydides 1. 100. 3
(cp. 4. 102. 2) synchronously with the
revolt and blockade of Thasos, and
dated by Busolt, III. i. 202, very
precisely to the late summer of 465 B.C.
Thucydides, however, without mentioning
Daton makes Drabeskos the scene
of the disaster. Stein suggests that
Hdt. has confounded the objective, or
goal, of the expedition, viz. Daton, with
the scene of the Athenian defeat, viz.
Drabeskos, which is to be placed ou the
road to Datos, or Daton. Drabeskos
is, indeed, the less problematic spot
geographically; its position is ascertained
“on the road from Herakleia Sintica
to Philippi” (Forbiger, <title>Alt. Geogr.</title> iii
1070), or at any rate to the north, and
inland from Philippi (cp. mod. <title>Drama</title>).
If the Athenians were defeated at
Drabeskos on their way to Datos, or
Daton, they were fetching a considerable
compass from Amphipolis and the
Strymou. Busolt (<foreign rend="ital">l.c.,</foreign> following Henzen)
regards Daton, at least in Hdt.'s time,
as the name not of a town but of a
district (that too seems to be Stein's
first idea); the reconciliation between
Hdt. and Thuc. in this case being
effected by the supposition that Hdt.
names the region and Thuc. the exact
scene, or the township nearest to the
scene, of the disaster. Cp. Strabo 331
(7. fr. 36) <foreign xml:lang="greek">para\ de\ th\n parali/an tou=

of Daton on the coast, hard by Neapolis;

the Attic tribute-lists of the fifth
century (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*nea/polis e)n *qra/kh|, *n. par)
*)antisa/ran, *neopoli=tai oi( para *qa/son</foreign>)
Daton is never mentioned. Neapolis
was, in fact, at that period the port for
the district of Datos; the town of
Daton was only founded <foreign rend="ital">c.</foreign> 360 B.C. by
the Thasians, when they took possession
of Krenides, under the leadership of the
exiled Athenian Kallistratos (Busolt,
<foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign> 197 note 5). The identification
of Daton with Krenides, the later
Philippi (Appian <title>B. C.</title> 4. 105 <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( de\

with Strabo's statement
above quoted; but Strabo must give
way to Harpokration's authorities; least
of all should Datos have been identified
with Neapolis (as by Leake, <title>N. G.</title> iii.
224). On the Edonians cp. 7. 110.</p>

against Spartan custom, cp. 8. 108, and

unfortunate puu, albeit the coutrast of the

it is only an “unconscious iteration.”
<foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s h(g. th=s st.</foreign> as a periphrasis for <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s

is remarkable. Perhaps the <foreign xml:lang="greek">h(gemoni/a</foreign> is
emphasized as the offence was one of
omission, incurred by the way. Possibly,
however, there was a political
background to the prosecution. Arkadia,
or single states in Arkadia, may
have been divided on the question of
‘Medism,’ cp. 8. 26. In the immediate
sequel Mantineia sides with Sparta, or
at least preserves a benevolent neutrality,
when all the rest of Arkadia rises against
her; cp. c. 35 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Mantineia was
early and uormally democratic; cp. 4.
161; but the discredit, which the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">h(gemo/nes</foreign> incurred in the Persiau war,
aud the penalties meted out to them,
may have brought about a temporary
modification of the government of Mantineia
(not without Lakonian approval).
It does not follow that the leaders were
really to blame. The injustice of the
Athenian democracy (probably humaner
than the Arkadian) towards unfortunate
commanders is uotorious; and the comic
story in Thuc. 5. 60 of the treatment of
Thrasylos, Strategos of Argos, by the
Argive democracy in 418 B.C., has much
the same moral.</p></div>

and many commentators since have
compared what Philippe de Comines, 5.

Charles the Bold at Granson, A.D. 1476.
The anecdote in Hdt. may be intended
not merely to discredit the Aiginetans
but to raise a laugh at the expense of
Sparta, with its iron money and so on.
As a matter of fact the glint of gold was
as recognizable in Sparta as anywhere
in the Greek world (cp. 1. 69, 3. 148,
5. 51); if there was any pilfering on
the field, and selling of stolen goods, no
doubt the thieves sold cheap, not so
much because they did not know the
difference between gold and brass, as
because they had to get rid of stolen
goods as quickly as possible.</p></div></div>
<div type="chapter" n="81">
<div type="commline" n="2">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">deka/thn e)celo/ntes</lem></app>. Stein
conceives the tithe (or the tithes) as
composed not of actual spoils, but of
values. That being so, the spoils must
have been valued, and even sold, before
the tithe was actually handed over;
unless we suppose that a rough estimate
and division of spoil was made, and the
tithes then conveited into money. In
either case, however, some time will
have elapsed before this operation was
complete, and it was hardly completed
on the field of Plataia. Three gods are
mentioned, three sacred places, as
recipients and receptacles; but it is not
clear whether one-tenth of all the spoil
was divided among the three gods (in
which case each would have received in
reality a thirtieth of the whole: Larcher's
view), or whether, as seems more
probable, each of the three divinities
received a full tithe (Baehr and others).
Here again, however, there is an unresolved
obscurity; it might be argued that
only Delphi obtained the full tithe (the
Amphiktyonic shrine being of greatest
pan-Hellenic importance); that a tithe
of what remained (i.e. 1/10 of 9/10) was
given to Olympia, the Peloponnesian
centre, while to the Isthmos went a
tithe of the remainder (10:9:8 1/10/100 being
thus the proportionate shares). But that
arrangement looks rather complicated!</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=| e)n *delfoi=si qew=|</lem></app>. If a tithe of
the spoil of Plataia was on the battlefield
set apart and consecrated to the god
in Delphi, the victors can scarcely have
held the god, or his ministers, guilty of
medism.</p>
<p>Plutarch, <title>Aristeid.</title> 11, shows the
lengths to which the <title>Rettung</title> of
Delphi could be carried: according to
that story the god in Delphi had
dictated the very spot for the Greek
victory, and that in response to an
Athenian inquiry!</p>
<p>Of the material reality and historic
authenticity of the <title>Anathema</title> at Delphi
there cannot be a shadow of doubt; but
the precise date at which it was made,
or provided for, the exact method by
which the expenses were defrayed, are
doubtful points. The list of states upon
<pb n="764"/>
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">trika/rhnos o)/fis</foreign> still legible proves
that the monument was not merely a
memorial of Plataia (even if offered from
the spoil of that battle exelusively), for
names occur upon it which were not
represented at Plataia.</p>
<p>The monument consisted of two parts,
as here described: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the golden <foreign xml:lang="greek">le/bhs</foreign>
or <foreign xml:lang="greek">krath/r</foreign>, elevated upon (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) a pillar,
having the appearance of a three-headed
serpent wound round a column. Thucydides,
1. 132. 2, does not accurately distinguish
the two parts, but speaks of the
whole offering as <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( tri/pous</foreign>. The golden
bowl was melted down by the Phokians
in the Sacred War, <bibl n="Paus. 10.13.5">Pausan. 10. 13. 5</bibl>.
The (gilt) bronze pillar upon which it
stood was carried off to Constantinople
by the founder, where it was discovered
in the <title>Atmeidan</title> by C. T. Newton in
1855 and the inscribed names deciphered,
as frequently since. Cp. Otto Frick, <title>Das

the temple, where its remains have been
found; cp. <bibl n="Paus. 10.14.7">Pausanias 10. 14. 7</bibl> (Frazer,
v. 309).</p>
<p>The base of the ‘Plataian’ monument
has also been found (cp. Frazer, v. 299).
The particularity of the description here
is not quite conclusive evidence that
Hdt. had visited Delphi, and seen the
‘Tripod’ before writing the passage, for
the immediate context contains evidence
of his having consulted written authorities
in regard to the allocation of the spoils,
and he does not here specify the connexion
of the Chians with the altar, as
in 2. 135, a passage in which “autopsy”
is much more evident than here. But
it need not therefore be denied for the
present chapter, which might very well
be an addition to the original draft of
the work, to be dated after his (first)
visit to Greece; cp. Introduction, § 9.</p>

Pausanias, 5. 23. 1-2, describes the bronze
figure, adds that it was dedicated by
the Greeks who fought at Plataia, and
gives the list of cities which took part
‘in the battle,’ from an inscription on
the right side of the base. The names
of the islanders from Keos, Melos, Tenos
again throw some doubt on the question
whether the list was rigidly limited to
the combatants at Plataia. This inscription
has not been recovered; and
we are therefore dependent for its contents
on the report of Pausanias, not in
all respects above suspicion. Cp. Introduction,
§ 10. For the size of the
statue (15 feet) upon the testimony of
Hdt. cp. further Frazer, <title>Pausanias</title>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">tw=| e)n *)isqmw=| qew=|</lem></app>: i.e. Poseidon.
A dedication to Poseidon from the spoils
of Plataia seems hardly called for, and
supports the view that these offerings
and monuments had reference to the
whole war; the suggestion is fortified
by the observation that no special
dedications are recorded for Artemision
and Mykale, the latter of which at least
must have been reckoned a victory.
(Was this offering connected with it?)
Hdt. however (8. 121) has recorded a
dedieation at Delphi after Salamis,
which may have been identical with the
Apollo, ‘from the spoils of Artemision
and Salamis,’ mentioned by <bibl n="Paus. 10.14.5">Pausanias
10. 14. 5</bibl>. The dedication at the Isthmos
is quite lost sight of subsequently;
cp. 8 121 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> The substitution of
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)cege/neto</lem></app> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nete/qh</foreign> may be merely a

stylistic variation, but in fact Hdt. does
not expressly say that the bronze
Poseidon was ever actually erected:
Pausanias in describing the Isthmos (2.
1. 7 etc.), though he mentions several
images of Poseidon, does not attempt
to identify any of them with the one
here in question.</p></div>

that of all the spoil only one-half would
remain for division among all the various
states concerned, and their commanders,

been combined with a consideration of
services rendered, the proportion of
dead, and so forth. Nor is it clear who
made the awards, whether the whole
council of war, or the Hegemonic state

These would have been the Plataians

the case was evidently an extraordinary

the subsequent fate of the building

<bibl n="Paus. 9.2.5">Pausanias 9. 2. 5</bibl> locates the tombs ou

Such is the precision of the actual

accurately described the tombs themselves:
<foreign xml:lang="greek">toi=s me\n ou)=n loipoi=s e)sti\n *)/ellhsi

statement of Hdt. below in regard to
the tombs of the Tegeatai, of the
Megarians aud Phleiasians, to say uothing
of the alleged kenotaphs, must be
incorrect. Blakesley suggests that
Pausanias mistook the barrow of the
Helots for ‘the common sepulture of
all the Greeks.’ Or was it the MegaroPhleiasian?
Pausanias proceeds: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*lakedaimoni/wn

unfortunately does not quote the

Frazer is doubtless right in decliniug
to see in the rock-cut graves, a little

suggests, a triple grave, a commou

That is, indeed, very probably what
they did; but Hdt. speaks of three

of which a separate group is deposited,
and, though the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/foi</foreign> may uot be <foreign xml:lang="greek">xwri/s</foreign>,
they appear to be quite distinct. If
Hdt is mistaken ou this point, it is

The <foreign xml:lang="greek">*le/ceis</foreign> contains the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)rh/n</foreign> (cp.
Stein <foreign rend="ital">ed. maj.</foreign> ii. 465), but this is the
only place in the text where it can
occur; the burial of <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(re/es</foreign> by themselves
is iuadmissible, and who were the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(re/es</foreign>?
So great an error iu Greek or Spartan
institutions Hdt. could not incur. The
<foreign xml:lang="greek">i)rh/n</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/rhn, ei)/rhn, i)/ran, *vi/ran</foreign>) was the
Spartiate warrior from twenty to thirty
years of age, Plutarch, <title>Lyk.</title> 17; cp.
G. Gilbert, <title>Gr. Staatsalt.</title> 1.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> 70; but it
is not credible that Spartan citizens of
that age occupied high military or civil
posts, uor is it credible that Poseidonios,
Amompharetos, Philokyon (cp. c. 71
<foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and Kallikrates (cp. c. 72 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>)
were merely <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)/ranes</foreign>, least of all Amompharetos.
Neither is it to be admitted
(with L. &amp; S. <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign>) that the word in
this passage denotes ‘officers of all
ranks’; the glosses in Hesychios (<foreign xml:lang="greek">i)re/nes:

due to combiuing the pseudo-etymology
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)/rhn</foreign> from <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)re/w</foreign>) in <title>Etym. Mag.</title> with
the misunderstaudiug of the gloss of
Hesychios above cited. It appears that
Hdt., though he employs the technical
term <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)re/nes</foreign>, has not understood it when
he puts the <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)re/nes</foreign> in one grave, ‘the rest
of the Spartiates’ in another, and the
Helots in a third. That arrangement,
indeed, takes no account of the ‘Lakedaimoniaus,’
or Perioikoi. Probably the
three trenches, or mouuds, covered (i.)
Spartiates—a majority of whom would
be <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)ra/nes</foreign>, (ii.) Lakedaimonians, (iii.)
Helots. Of the first, ninety-one had
fallen, c. 70 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> the figures for the

Hdt. derived this passage from a Spartan

it is wide of the mark. The ‘trophies

here is the record, or the hint, of a
deliberation, a council, which issues in a
resolution to ‘visit’ Thebes. Ought the
record in Plutarch <title>Aristeid.</title> 21 of the
treaty of Plataia, or the revision of the
confederate articles and the institution
of the <title>Eleutheria,</title> to be inserted here?
Grote (iv. 282) seems to date it to “a
general and solemn meeting, held at
Plataia after the victory,” but also
apparently dates that meeting after the
surrender of Thebes. Plutarch omits
the Theban incident altogether, and
there is no room below for any other
congress or meeting at Plataia after the
surrender of Thebes. If, then, the
meeting which carried the psephism of
Aristeides was held at Plataia, it would
be the meeting here imperfectly reported;
but perhaps the psephism of Aristeides,
if ever carried at all, was carried at a
congress at the Isthmos, for which room
may be fouud in c. 88 <foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Grote
defends the authenticity of the psephism
of Aristeides, but the story, as told by
<pb n="773"/>
Plutarch, is not confirmed by Thucydides
2. 71, for (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) nothing is there said of the
renewal or extension of the military
confederacy; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the privileges accorded
the Plataians are granted by Pausanias
at a meeting of the allies in the Agora
of Plataia. This grant might very well
have been made at the meeting here
recorded. Grote hardly showed his
normal sagacity in accepting the story of
the psephism of Aristeides and at the
same time rejecting the story of the
quarrel over the Aristeia (which certainly
ill squares with it!).</p></div>

If the story told in 7. 132 of the vow in
the previous year against the medizers
were true, the resolution now formally
taken, to demand the extradition of the
traitors among the Thebans, would
appear both mild and superfluous: a
reason the more for doubting the truth
of that story. But again, this resolution
recognizes very clearly the existence of
two parties in Thebes, the medizing

not the Hoplites; cp. c. 69 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> and 7.

Pausanias may have disbanded, or dismissed
to their homes, from Thebes, the
Athenians, and perhaps the Aiginetaus,
and one or two other contingents; but
it is very unlikely that the rest of the
allied forces will have been disbanded
at Thebes, or before reaching the Isthmos.
There appears to be a tendency in this
passage, i.e. in the source followed by
Hdt. for the story, to make Pausanias
himself wholly and solely responsible
for the execution of (Timagenidas and)
the anonymous Theban <foreign rend="ital">dévoués</foreign> (was
Asopodoros, c. 69 <foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> among them?
was Leontiades, 7. 233?). They are not
tried by a Spartan court (like the
Plataians fo&lt;*&gt; ‘atticism’ in 427 B.C.,
Thuc. 3. 5&lt;*&gt;-68), nor brought before a
jury of the allies; Pausanias puts them
to death out of hand. This appears to
be a very arbitrary proceeding, just such
as might be ascribed to him after his
fall, at a time when various parties
might be glad to wash their hands, at
his expense, of anti-Theban conduct.
Blakesley goes a long step further in
damning the memory of Pausanias: he
accepts this story just as it stands, for
the facts, and suggests, as the explanation,
that Pausanias had been already
intriguing with the Persians, and “put
the Theban oligarchs to death in order to
conceal the evidenee which they might
have given against him, had they been
brought to trial.” But then Blakesley
(with Ktesias) also believed that the battle
of Plataia took place before the battle of
Salamis, and was quite a small and
trifling affair (virtually, indeed, a defeat
for the Greeks). It is at least possible
that the Theban prisoners were duly, or
at least  <foreign rend="ital">pro forma,</foreign> put upon their trial
at the Isthmos, and that this was indeed
one of the conditions of their surrender
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">h(mei=s h(me/as au)tou\s e)s a)ntilogi/hn pare/comen</foreign>):
Pausanias merely executed the

This narrative is resumed from c. 66
<foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Hdt.'s partiality for the patronymic
in the case of ‘*(artabazos son of
Pharnakes’ is remarkable; he gives it
in 7. 66, 8. 126, 9. 41, 66, and here,
five times in all; in fact there are only
three places, and those all in this Book,
viz. cc. 58, 70, 77, where the name is
introduced in anything like a fresh connexion
without it: the first place is in
a speech by Mardonios; in the other
two, where the historiau writes <foreign rend="ital">propria
persona,</foreign> the reference to the immediate
context is so slight aud so obvious (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\s</foreign>
sc. <foreign xml:lang="greek">muria/das ta\s e)/xwn *)arta/bazos e)/feuge,
tou\s meta\ *)artaba/zou feu/gontas</foreign>) that the
introduction of the patronymic would
have been a stylistic absurdity. There
may be a polemical purpose in this curious
iteration: was there another Artabazos
with whom ‘the son of Pharnakes’ was
liable to be confounded? For example,
the Artabazos who figures in Diodoros
as successful against the Athenians in
the Egyptian war (11. 74. 6, 77. 4), and
again as admiral in the Kyprian war
(<bibl n="Diod. 12.3.2">12. 3. 2</bibl>) and negotiating the ‘Peace of
Kallias’ (<bibl n="Diod. 12.4.5">12. 4. 5</bibl>); cp. 7. 151 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign>
Or is not that indeed the very same
man? Otherwise who or what was his
father, aud his father's father? The
name <foreign xml:lang="greek">*farna/khs</foreign> has been regarded as a
variant for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*farnou/xhs</foreign> (or <foreign rend="ital">vice versa</foreign>); cp.
Rawlinson, iii.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> p 549. Was the father
of Artabazos the high-placed hipparch
who died by a fall from his horse at
Sardes? cp. 7. 88. The names Pharnakes
and Pharnabazos afterwards recur
in the satrapy of Daskyleion; cp. 8. 126
<pb n="777"/>
<foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> Pharnabazos ‘son of Pharnakes,’
413-388 B.C. (Thuc. 8. 6, 1), was succeeded
by Ariobarzanes (Xenoph. <title>Hell,</title>
5. 1. 28, cp. 1. 4, 7), and he in turn
by an Artabazos; Krumbholz, <foreign rend="ital">op. c.</foreign>
p. 73. Another Ariobarzanes ‘son of
Artabazos’ appears with his father among
the most loyal followers of the last
Dareios (cp. Arrian, 3, 21. 4, 23. 7, etc.).
The names Pharnakes, Pharnabazos,
Artabazos, Ariobarzanes all belong, <foreign rend="ital">ll.c.,</foreign>
apparently to one house, or clan, and
that, one highly placed and esteemed in
the Persian Empire (cp. Judeich <foreign rend="ital">ap.</foreign>
Pauly-Wissowa, <foreign rend="ital">sub v.</foreign>). There is a gap
in the succession at Daskyleion between
470 B.C. or thereabouts and 430 B.C.
Was it filled by ‘Pharnabazos’ the
father of Pharnakes II.? The name
Pharnabazos does not occur in Hdt.</p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">feu/gwn e)k *plataie/wn</lem></app>. Hdt. has
been suspected of special relations with
the family of Artabaxos, cp 8. 126
<foreign rend="ital">supra,</foreign> but he never represents his retreat
as anything but a <foreign xml:lang="greek">fugh/</foreign>. In that respect,
unless it be in the softer verb at the
close of this very chapter, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)peno/sthse</foreign>, he
may have done his supposed patron less
than justice. The ‘flight’ of Artabazos
from ‘Plataia’ may be little more
historical than the ‘flight’ of Xerxes
from Athens. The story, as told in this

The rôle assigned to Artabazos helped
to explain two awkward facts, awkward
especially to medizing Greeks afterwards:
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the defeat of Mardonios, and their
own; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the escape of 40,000 men, who
might have been stopped, and offered as
an atonement to the patriotic league.
The historical element in the quarrels of
Mardomos and Artabazos is problematic,
and in view of the licence of Greek
historiography a critic may be pardoned
if he suspect at times that Artabazos
never was on the field of Plataia at
all. Cp Appendix VIII. § 5 (19). <app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)k

Mardonios; cp. c. 41 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign> In any
case it is not likely that Artabazos, with
some 40,000 Persians, regained Thessaly
ahead of the Aleuads and the Thessalian
cavalry; or that on his arrival no news
of <foreign xml:lang="greek">tw=n e)n *plataih=|si</foreign> had reached Thessaly.
It does not really help to interpret <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi(

the bulk of the population, and so on,
as compared with the Aleuads and

Thessaly, as in Phokis, as in Boiotia,
as in the Peloponnese, as possibly in
Athens itself (cp. Plutarch. <title>Aristeid.</title> 13),
two parties, two rival interests on the

is also an absurdity. There were 1000
Phokians in the camp of Mardonios, c.

The vague reference to his mission, the
suppression of his object (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata/ ti prh=gma</foreign>),
is not the least of the absurdities in the
story; Artabazos would have had the
sense to lie with more circumstance, if
lying had been necessary, or the
Thessalians would have asked for details.
But this story presents one of those
monologues which are all alike suspicious,
cp. c. 58 <foreign rend="ital">supra.</foreign></p>
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">pemfqei/s</lem></app> seems to imply the

with the view that the army numbered

What then of Alexander and the
Makedonians at this crisis? (Was he
not, like the Aleuadai so far, in Artabazos'
company?) Demosthenes, 23. 200, says
that ‘Perdikkas’ king of Makedonia
destroyed <foreign xml:lang="greek">tou\s a)naxwrou=ntas e)k *plataiw=n

Athenians in consequence (ps.-Dem.
13. 24). Perhaps the only serious
mistake Demosthenes here makes is in
calling the Makedonian ‘Perdikkas’; but
the passage says nothing of Artabazos,
and might be true even if Alexander
saw Artabazos and his 40,000 safely
through Makedonia, and no less true if
Artabazos had never taken his 40,000
southwards across the Axios at all!</p>

i.e. marching not by the coast, but by a
shorter or more direct route, further
inland; cp. 7. 124. It is not clear for
what portion of the route of Artabazos
the remark holds good; doubtless from
Therme to Akanthos, cp. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.;</foreign> but further
east likewise an inland course may have
been followed, from Akanthos to Doriskos
for example; cp. 7. 121. At Doriskos
(cp. 7. 106) Artabazos would learn that
the bridges on the Hellespont were
threatened, or were in fact destroyed,
cp. c. 114 <foreign rend="ital">infra</foreign> (if he did not know it
already), and that Sestos was being
blockaded, if not actually in the hands of
the Hellenes. To get to Byzantion he
would therefore give the Hellespont and
Thrakian Chersonese a wide berth,
though he might have made for
Perinthos in the first instance (cp. 7, 25).</p></div>

have been before the capture of Byzantion
by Pausanias in 478-7 B.C. (Thuc. 1. 94,

reappears very soon as satrap of Daskyleion
(Thuc. 1. 129). This is, oddly
enough, the first and only mention of
Byzantion by Hdt, in these Books; it
figures more largely in his ‘second
volume,’ cp. 4. 87, 144, 5. 26, 103, 6. 5,
26, 33 (probably after he had seen the
city, cp. <title>Hdt. IV.-VI.</title> i. p. xcv.);
it is not mentioned in Bks. 1, 2, 3, an

nature of their contents, or from the
circumstances of their composition.</p>

Athenagoras (perhaps the two pairs

The coinage (silver, of five periods, but

Dodona fills a larger place in the earliet
Books of Herodotos, esp. 2. 52, a passage
which proves a personal visit by the
historian to the place. It is here mentioned
purely <foreign rend="ital">en passant,</foreign> and no doubt
taken over from the source, whatever it
was, of the story of Evenios; and there
is nothing in the notice to suggest that
this passage was penned after Hdt.'s
visit — rather the reverse; nothing in
fact to lead us to date the composition
of this passage other than early in the
genesis of the work.</p>
<p>Strabo 327-8 treats at length of
Dodona; Steph. Byz. devotes his longest
article thereto. The Dodona in question
here is, of course, the Thesprotian (cp. 4.
33), or oldest Greek oracle, which had
seemingly been eclipsed by Delphi,
though the tribes and cities of the
neighbourhood naturally resorted thereto.
It was destined to something like
a revival at a later time, when Delphi
was in difficulties, and during the Roman
period, when all this district rose in
importance. The method, or methods,
of divination practised at Dodona are
obscure; upon the whole subject cp.

1878.</p>

the plural (<foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toi/</foreign>) is remarkable, as associating
Zeus and Apollon in the joint

by remembering that there was a <foreign xml:lang="greek">*zeu\s

the Greek Pantheon. Even Kroisos was
not favoured to this extent (1. 46-49)
unless indeed we are to infer that
Apollon and Amphiaraos exactly coincided
on that occasion. Are we to
suppose collusion, genuine inspiration,
or false report, as the source of this
coincidence? Or is the record an inexact
one; did the one oracle merely
confirm the other, as if, for example, the
Apolloniates might have inquired first
at Dodona, and then, dissatisfied with
the reply, have gone to Delphi only to
get it reaffirmed there? (Cp. the action

<p><foreign xml:lang="greek">au)toi/</foreign> must, of eourse, refer to the gods,

with 2. 55 (of Dodona) and
with 8. 36 (of Delphi) is vitiated by the
assumption that Hdt. is a careful and
self-consistent writer. But further, a
<foreign xml:lang="greek">profh/ths</foreign> is mentioned for Delphi in 8.
37, and in 2. 55 we have to reckon not
merely with the three female <foreign xml:lang="greek">proma/nties</foreign>

and Strabo 402 declares that to the end
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*boiwtoi=s mo/nois a)/ndras proqespi/zein e)n

everything their own way. Possibly if
Hdt. had been in Dodona before writing
this passage he would have expressed
himself differently: the failure to specify
the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*puqi/h</foreign> for Delphi might in any case
be merely a bit of careless composition.</p></div>

sorely tempted into extravagantdemands.

Hdt. apparently means that while the
rest of the Persian fleet retired on the
mainland, close by, the Phoenician
squadron or contingent was sent to sail
right away — exactly &lt;*&gt;ither he does
not indicate. Others supply the omission
—home. This statement in any form
is a major crux. That the Phoenician
fleet was clean dismissed to save it from
a battle, and in the presence of the
enemy, is scarce credible. If it was at
Samos in the spring of 480 B.C. it would
have retired on the mainland and helped
to defend the fortified camp on Mykale;
or, if detached from the rest of the
fleet, it would have been employed on
some special service—an advance on the
Kyklades, left exposed by the Greeks,
or more probably to operate upon the
rear of the Greek force, or to attack the
ships, after the greater part of the Greek
forces had been drawn on to the mainland,
and induced to debark.</p>
<p>Hdt. can hardly be understood as
meaning that the Phoenician ships had
been dismissed (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ph=kan</foreign> aorist pluperfect!)
in the winter (“schon im Winter,” Stein)
home. That may have been the case;
but if so, Hdt. does not know it.</p>
<p>Domaszewski has suggested that the
Phoenician (and Egyptian) fleets were
really all the time on service off Thrace,
Makedon, Thessaly, protecting the coasts,
and attending to the commissariat of
Mardonios. But Hdt. does account for
the ‘Egyptians’ (c. 32 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>); and if
the Phoenicians were in the Thrakian
sea, why did they not support or cover
Sestos? Or how did they get away?
If the Phoenicians are withdrawn from
the Persian fleet at Samos, and the
Egyptians likewise, what remains?
Very little except Greek vessels, or
quasi-Greek (Kypriote), whose loyalty
<pb n="792"/>
to Persia certainly could not be trusted
at this juncture. Had the Phoenicians
been present, yet the Persian admirals
would hardly have risked a sea-battle in
Greek waters, even with the memory of
Lade to back them. Cp. Appendix VII.
§ 1. Hdt.'s rationale or motivation for
the retirement upon the mainland, and
the dismissal of the Phoenician contingent,
is presumably an inference from
the facts, but a not unreasonable inference;
the Persian admirals felt they
were not equal to fighting a battle at
sea with the Greeks (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">o(/moioi</lem></app> = <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)cio/maxoi</foreign>);
and they desired to obtain the cover
(<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">u(po/</lem></app>, cp. 8. 92 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) and cooperation
of the large land-army, which was holding
Ionia. But Hdt. fails to explain
why the Persians were not <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)cio/maxoi</foreign> at
sea (absence of the Phoenicians, etc.,
suspect loyalty of the Ionians, etc.);
and he certainly credits them with no
ulterior intention or hope of luring the
Greeks on to the mainland, into the
clutches of the <foreign rend="ital">corps d'armée.</foreign></p></div>
<div type="commline" n="9">
<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)n th=| *muka/lh|</lem></app>. Mykale has been
described c. 90 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign> simply as <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s
*)iwni/hs</foreign> (assuming the text to be there
complete, at least so far as this point
is concerned). The mention of Mykale
in 7. 80 is merely <foreign rend="ital">en passant,</foreign> and does
not prejudice the problem of composition
in any way. It is more significant that
no geographical description of Mykale
occurs in this Book, whereas such a
description is given iu Bk. 1. 148 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( de\
*muka/lh esti\ th=s h)pei/rou a(/krh pro\s ze/furon
a)/nemon kath/kousa *sa/mw| katanti/on</foreign>): how
is such a sequence to be reconciled with
the hypothesis that these Books (7-9)
are the earliest portion of Hdt.'s work
drafted by him, and in particular that
Bk. 9 is of older composition than
Bk. 1? The answer is not really difficult.
(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) Mykale was a locality famous in
this story, and Hdt. has not pansed to
describe it expressly; at the same time
incidentally the topography of the place
is here in evidence. (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The passage in
Bk. 1 occurs in an eminently descriptive
passage, where a topographical note
was obviously in order. (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) Hdt. had
probably in writing the early Books of
his history a western, or at least a
larger, audience more distinctly in view
than when he first sat down to write
the annals of the great invasion; it is
to this wider public that the large
amount of geography in Bks. 1-4 is
addressed. (<foreign rend="ital">d</foreign>) The whole context in
1. 148 forbids the supposition that in
describing Mykale there he has the
battle of 479 B.C. in view; and equally
in this pla the total absence of any
back reference to 1. 148 is noticeable.
As far as this story was concerned he
was content originally with the simple
indication <foreign xml:lang="greek">th=s *)iwni/hs</foreign> c. 90 <foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> that,
indeed, would have been superfluous if
he had had 1. 148 in view. (<foreign rend="ital">e</foreign>) It is
also observable that in 6. 16 Mykale is
mentioned as requiring no description
whatever. The explanation there is
probably not that he has the description
in 1. 148 in view, but that he is following
an Ionian source in the account of
the Ionian revolt, and that the source
took Mykale for granted. Mykale is,
however, here hoth expressly and
incidentally more fully described than
there; though that passage now precedes
this in the opus.</p></div>

The passage in Pausanias is unfortunately

be connected with this title of the goddesses

nothing curious in finding a Boiotian title
(i.e. a prae-Boiotian or old Ionian title

taken by the Persians is the removal of
the Milesians from the camp, on the
plea that they are best qualified to guard
the passes on Mykale. Precaution and
plea are perplexing. The charge of
the passes over Mykale interposes a
suspected force between the Persians
and Sardes, and the camp between that
force and Miletos. Are the facts or
the motives here rightly reported? If
there were no Milesians in the Persian
camp at Mykale, was it because the
Persians had dismissed them? Or were
there ‘Milesians’ and ‘Milesians’? If
the Persians entrusted to Milesians the
guard of the passes, that would rather
point to a confidence in their loyalty!
And who are these Milesians? According
to 6. 19 f. the Milesians had been
annihilated and the remnant expatriated
in 494 B.C., i.e. fifteen years previously;
their places had been taken by Persians
and Karians, the former as landlords,
the latter as labourers. Was there
already a new agrarian question in
Miletos (cp. 5. 29)? Or is the situation
of 494 B.C. grossly exaggerated? In
any case it is significant of Hdt.'s
methods that he betrays no misgiving
on this point. Possibly when he first
composed this passage he was unacquainted
with the story told in 6. 19,
or at least had not incorporated it in
his own work—the last three Books
being of earlier composition.</p>

nothing said of the subsequent history

weak spot in the story, in the argument;

<p>A <foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/mh</foreign> which Hdt. treats as in no

as divine.</p>
<p><bibl n="Diod. 11.35">Diodoros 11. 35</bibl> (Ephoros), cp. Polyain.
1. 33, completely rationalizes the story
of this <foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/mh</foreign>, regarding it as a ruse by
Leotychidas; Larcher and Thirlwall
approve. A somewhat similar case was
the fraud of Agesilaos in 394 B.C., which
no doubt helped him to win the battle
of Koroneia (Xenoph. <title>Hell.</title> 4. 3. 10-14),
when he announced the defeat of the
Lakedaimonian fleet off Knidos to his
army as a victory; but he had received
actual despatches, and had no need to
pretend a synchronism. If a few days'
interval occurred between the victory
in Boiotia and the victory in Ionia the
<foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/mh</foreign> is simple enough. If there was
a real synchronism between the battles
of Plataia and Mykale, then one of three
or four alternatives can alone be true:
either (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/mh</foreign> was a fraud, a ruse,
a <foreign xml:lang="greek">gennai=on yeu=dos</foreign> at the moment, which
afterwards proved to be true to fact;
or (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) it was in truth supernatural,
supernormal, whether you explain it
by direct divine interposition or by
abnormally heightened human feeling;
or (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) thirdly, it is an element of
afterthought, a product of tradition,
an embellishment of the facts, possibly
traceable to excited hopes and feelings
of the actual day, but without the
adequate or full basis of fact asserted
by the pious tradition. There is so
much of this kind of thing in the story
of the war that it does not appear
unreasonable to ascribe the <foreign xml:lang="greek">fh/mh</foreign> <foreign rend="ital">motif,</foreign>
though it rings out more precisely and
positively than any other, to the same

the Hellenes, i.e. the naval <title>Synedrion,</title>

Again in 494 B.C. a few voluntarily

(6. 20) had left their homes for ever. A
migration <foreign rend="ital">en masse</foreign> had recently been
recommended to Athens by the Delphic

the range of practical politics by Themistokles

and yielded the point—the matriculation
of the ‘Samians’ and ‘Chians’ (which
appear on the <title>Marmor Par.</title> 27 as
colonies from Athens) might seem to
be inconsistent therewith. But was
the Ionian settlement in Samos rightly
ascribed to Athens? The Ionians of
Samos were ultimately traced back to
Epidauros; cp. <bibl n="Paus. 7.4.2">Pausan. 7. 4. 2</bibl> (cp.
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*dwrie/es</foreign> (<foreign rend="ital">sic</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)epidau/rioi</foreign> Hdt. 1. 146).
The ease of Chios is even more obscure;
according to the native historian, Ion, a
contemporary of Hdt.'s, the island was
peopled by Abantes from Euboia (cp. Hdt.
1. 146), and by immigrants from Histiaia;
their ‘Ionization’ they owed to a king
Hektor, in the third generation after;
but Ion failed to account for the Chians
being reckoned Ionians (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ou) me/ntoi e)kei=no/

e)s *)/iwnas</foreign>, <bibl n="Paus. 7.4.10">Pausan. 7. 4. 10</bibl>). Possibly
Sainos and Chios, at least in 479 B.C.,
were not yet accounted ‘Athenian’
colonies; and even the passage in Hdt.
1. 146-7 distinguishes among the Ionians
between <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi( <gap/> a)po\ tou= prutanhi/ou tou=

(The passage in c. 147 making the
<title>Apaturia</title> the test of Ionism admits
that the Ephesians and Kolophonians
did not observe it; but the passage is
very like a gloss.) The Athenians
might protest against any intervention
between themselves and their settlements
abroad, and yet allow the enrolment
of Samos and Chios in the Hellenic
alliance without a murmur, having (at
this time at least) no metropolitan elaim
over these islands any more than over
the Aiolian Lesbos. But the whole
story of the deliberations is, of course,
highly suspicious; the proposed <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)na/stasis</foreign>

and probably the first instance
of the investiture of a Greek subject
with a Persian governorship. (<foreign rend="ital">c</foreign>) This
fact (which belongs to the history of
the <title>Pentekontaëteris</title>) may be regarded as
more certain than the cause or occasion

<div type="chapter" n="108">
<p>There follows here, by way of
digression (cc. 108-113), a story of the
King's Amour, or the Death of Masistes,
which exhibits Hdt. at his best. A
story could hardly be better told, or
present more artfully the elements of a
domestic tragedy, of a palace intrigue,
started in passion and jealousy, culminating
in torture, rebellion, death. One
great defect the story, indeed, has from
the moral point of view: it is the
innocent who suffer, or who suffer most;
the guilty king, the jealous and cruel
queen, come off scot free. Two considerations
may slightly relieve this objection
from an aesthetic standpoint: Artaynta,
the daughter of Masistes, has a good deal
to answer for: she is the root of the
mischief. Again, ‘rebellion is as the
sin of witchcraft,’ and Masistes and his
sons die with arms in their hands against
the king. But it eannot be said that
Hdt. makes anything of these <foreign rend="ital">motifs.</foreign>
As a historian he might plead (though it
is not his way!) that the faets were as
he stated them, painfully immoral. and
aesthetically distressing. As a moralist
he might plead that the true moral lay
outside the story, in the suggestion of
all that Hellas had been spared by the
successful resistanee to the Oriental
despot, which had made such tragedies,
possible in tyrants' houses, for ever
impossible in Hellas! And, again, that
he thus dismisses Xerxes, to go to his
own place, the scorn and derision of all
good men, with his lawless passions and
his slavish submission to ‘the law of
the Medes and Persians,’ his childish
vanities (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h(sqei\s periba/lletai</foreign>) and his
prodigal pleasures (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h(sqei\s de\ kai\ tau/th|</foreign>),
his humorous caprices (speeches to
Masistes) and his capricious wrath
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">qumwqei/s</foreign>). The dramatic narrative falls
into five acts.</p>
<p>(i.) The scene in Sardes: Xerxes'
passion for his brother Masistes' wife:
her faithfulness and virtue! and the
king's ruse to win her, by wedding his
son Dareios to her daughter.</p>
<p>(ii.) The scene shifts to Susa: the
king's still fouler transfer of his affections
from his brother's wife to his son's
wife, Artaynta.</p>
<p>(iii.) The fatal gift: the robe of
Amestris the queen: her jealousy and
error: destruction to the wife of Masistes,
the mother of Artaynta!</p>
<p>(iv.) The king's birthday feast: the
queen's request: the despot's involuntary
humiliation.</p>
<p>(v.) The catastrophe: wreck of the
house of Masistes. (Masistes rejects the
king's overtures: the mutilation of his
wife: the rebellion, and its defeat.)</p>
<p>It is an omission that Artaynta does
not expressly share the fate of her
family.</p>
<p>This story might almost rank with
the Hebrew story of <title>Esther</title> as an illustration
of life at the Persian court.
But, except for the external referenee
above indicated, it lacks the national and
popular setting, the political purpose,
and therewith the ethical contents, which
ennoble the Jewish tale. The Greek
interest in this tale is purely reflexive.
No Greek, whether man or woman,
figures in this drama: the virtues of the
wife of Masistes are purely domestic;
her husband as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)nh\r a)gaqo/s</foreign>, good
man, husband, father, and yet rebel
withal, prepared to work ‘no end of ill’
to the king, his brother, umtes to some
extent the rôles of Mordecai and Haman;
the king himself cuts no great figure in
either tale, but here he is less of a
puppet and more of a curse, while
behind and over all rises the terrible
figure of Amestris, ‘a fury slinging
flame,’ a barbarian fiend incarnate.
(If Ahasuerus = Xerxes, Esther would =
Amestris. But that cannot be, “if we
accept the stories which Hdt. tells of
Amestris,” and which the Jews tell of
Esther.)</p>

<foreign rend="ital">supra;</foreign> it is, however, a question whether
Xerxes was in Sardes at this time, and
not rather engaged, in upper Asia,
in the reduction of the revolted satrapy
of Babylon; cp. C. F. Lehmann, ‘Xerxes

Xerxes, as we are here given to understand,
spent the winter of 480-79 B.C.,

summer, in Sardes, presumably awaiting
the issue of the campaign in Greece.

Masistes apparently throughout has only

not, for Xerxes took measures to crush

but was overtaken on the way thither,
and came to an end. The mention of
his army, however (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ th\n stratih\n th\n

that view, which is also not in itself
probable; Masistes and his sons would
have reached Baktria long before the

Xerxes. Hdt. is led into the inconsistency
and error apparently by his own
notion (<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">w(s e)moi\ doke/ein</lem></app>) that, if Masistes
had once succeeded in raising a revolt
in Baktria, he would have wrought the
king no end of woe; in other words, the
ease with which Masistes was suppressed
convinced Hdt. that he had not actually
raised a rebellion in Baktria, and as the
Baktrians were devoted to Masistes, he
cannot have reached Balkh, or he would
have raised a rebellion.</p>
<p>Probably Masistes, as satrap of Baktria,
did raise the province, and fell fighting
at the head of the eastern levies of the
empire. The gruesome story just related
was an attempt to explain the cause of
the revolt in terms acceptable to Hellenic
romance. There may have been a set of
more political factors at work. There
was a constant possibility in the Achaimenid
Empire of a rupture between the
eastern and western halves, the Iranian
highland, and the older centres and areas
of secular civilization The weakness of
Xerxes, and the ignominious failure of
the European expedition, were calculated
to provoke disloyalty. Masistes, his
brother, was but re-enacting the rôle of
Bardiya, the son of Kyros the Great;
Xerxes, or his servants, succeeded, as
Kambyses, or again as Dareios had succeeded,
in reasserting the unity of the
empire. Masistes, who like Xerxes himself
united both strains in the Achaimenid
pedigree (cp. 7. 11 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), was a
very formidable Pretender, and a far
better man evidently than his brother.
Rawlinson (<foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>) seems to underestimate
the possibilities of a Baktrian secession,
or Home-rule movement, though he is
justified in correcting the excesses of
Blakesley in the other direction. The
loyalty of the Baktrians to Dareios and
their general loyalty to the Achaimenid
<pb n="820"/>
House (based upon the <foreign rend="ital">argumentum a
silentio</foreign>) might not prevent their preferring
a Masistes to a Xerxes. The failure of
Masistes in the end may have been due to
the fact that the flower of the Baktrians
had been culled by Mardonios (cp. 8.
113 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>), and their bones were now
enriching the plain of Boiotia. The
exact date of Masistes' attempt is
problematic; but it falls, no doubt, into
the <title>Pentekontaeteris.</title></p></div></div>

<p><app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">*prwtesi/lew tou= *)ifi/klou</lem></app>. Protesilaos
led to Troy the men of Phylake,
Pyrasos, Iton, Antron, Ptelion, leaving
a wife and half-built house behind him
in Phylake. First of all Achaians he
leaped ashore, and was felled in the very
act by a Dardan, <title>Iliad</title> (2. 695-702).
At home in Phylake he was worshipped
(as a hero): <foreign xml:lang="greek">*prwtesi/la, to\ teo\n d' a)ndrw=n

Pindar, <title>Isth.</title> 1. 58. And in the Thrakian
Chersonese his tomb (<foreign xml:lang="greek">ta/fos</foreign>) was to be

(cp. 8. 138 <foreign rend="ital">supra</foreign>) and Amphiaraos (<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign>),
as all three heroes who have been
apotheosized (that is of the very
essenee of Polytheism, cp. A. Lyall,
<title>Asiatic Studies,</title> pp. 20 ff.). Stein (note
<foreign rend="ital">ad l.</foreign>) asserts that he was (<foreign rend="ital">ohne Zweifel</foreign>)
a pre-Hellenic deity, in the Chersonese,
identified, for some reason or other, with
the Greek hero. Our own Wordsworth
has made his ghost the subject of a
pseudo-antique conversation in one of
his best-known poems (<title>Laodamia</title>), the
<foreign rend="ital">motifs</foreign> of which he may have taken from
Hyginus' <title>Fabulae</title> 103, 104. Those fables,
especially the second, point to an
orgiastic, or mysterious cult, proper to
women, and perhaps at home in Thrace,
which might in part at least explain the
worst charges against Artayktes; cp.
<foreign rend="ital">infra.</foreign> Iphiklos is the father of Protesilaos
and Podarkes (<title>Iliad l.c.</title>) and himself
the son of Phylakos (<foreign rend="ital">ibid.</foreign> 13, 698), the
founder of Phylake. According to the
myth in <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.281-297"><title>Od.</title> 11. 281-297</bibl> he was the
owner of beeves, that Neleus was bent
on getting stolen, and the would-be
cattle-lifter was caught and kept a year

37, 8. 131 (cp. also the history of the
<title>Triennium,</title> Bk. 6). This consideration
makes it plain that Hdt. has here in
view the campaigning year 479-78 B.C.
But there are nevertheless two questions
which remain: (<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) the date of the return
of the Fleet from the Hellespont to
Athens; (<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) the date of the next expedition,
under Pausanias, to Kypros, <bibl n="Thuc. 1.94">Thuc.
1. 94</bibl>. Is there not a reference thereto
in this passage?</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">a</foreign>) According to Rawlinson <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixeima/santes</foreign>
in <bibl n="Thuc. 1.89.2">Thuc. 1. 89. 2</bibl> means not that
they passed the winter before Sestos
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">diaxeima/zein</foreign>), but that they just reached
winter before taking it; cp. <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pipoliou=sqai,
e)piperka/zein</foreign> (inceptives), and <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi-</foreign>
as dimin. in composition with adj.
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi/pikros</foreign>, etc.). It is possible that the
Athenian fleet reached home before our
New Year (though that cannot be Hdt.'s
new <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/tos</foreign>); and the remark here would
be in that case correct, though rather
otiose.</p>
<p>(<foreign rend="ital">b</foreign>) The expedition under Pausanias
certainly did not start before the spring
of 478 B.C., i.e. after Hdt.'s ‘New Year.’
The interpretation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixeima/santes</foreign> in
Thuc. <foreign rend="ital">l.c.</foreign> as involving the whole winter
dated the return of the Athenians to the
spring, and led to the start of Pausanias
being pushed on into the summer,
possibly even over the Athenian New
Year. The revision of the meaning of
<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pixeima/santes</foreign> allows an earlier and
normal date for the expedition of 478
B.C., and leaves of course this chronological
note of Hdt.'s, if it be indeed his,
correct. but again otiose.</p>
<p>I doubt the authenticity of this sentence.
It has all the air of being inserted
by some one with the history of the
<title>Pentekontaeteris</title> before him. It could not,
indeed, prove the work of Hdt. to be
unfinished, or incomplete; but it lends
perhaps some colour to that misconception.
Remove it and the story of the
war as told by Hdt. attains a finer
climax, apart from the colophon, or
concluding anecdote, in c. 122. The
last item in the annals of the war, that
great <title>Biennium</title> (or <foreign xml:lang="greek">*triethri/s</foreign>), is the
dedication of the cables which had bound
Europe to Asia, and paved the way for
the barbarous invader of Hellas. The
sentence has all the air of a gloss, and
it not merely spoils the splendid climax
<app><lem xml:lang="greek" n="U">e)s ta\ i(ra/</lem></app>, but separates unduly the
closing anecdote from the peg upon
which it depends, the name and fate of
Artayktes.</p></div></div>

son (Cherasmis?) Kyros had bullied 1.
114, somewhere about 570 B.C, though
the exigencies of that anecdote require
Artembares to have been a ‘Mede.’
Artayktes, the governor of Sestos, is
not a young man in 479 B.C. His father
might have been a boy with Kyros nearly
a century before (two generations will
sometimes exceed a century). The whole
anecdote here is, however, full of inconsequence.
The scene is placed just
after the overthrow of Astyages (<foreign xml:lang="greek">katelw\n

relation between ‘Physics and Politics’
occupied a large space in the minds of
Greek thinkers. Hdt.'s own work is
<pb n="830"/>
saturated with the assumption of a
connexion between race and place,
between climate and institutions. His
interest in the varieties of human kind
makes him the father of Anthropology,
as his sense of the unity and continuity of
human adventure and experience makes
him the ‘father of history.’ Hence his
descriptions of the land and river of
Egypt as a prelude to his account of the
people, their manners and institutions;
and so too with Skythia and the
Skythians, Libya and the Libyans, the
ends of the earth, and the more familiar
coasts of the Aigaian. Hdt. has in a
remarkable degree the sense of the
relativity of human institutions; it is a
part of the sophistical illumination of
the age, just begun. It had done something
to correct the exaggerated notion
of the omnipotence of the <title>Nomothetes.</title> It
attains formal expression in the work of his
great contemporary Hippokrates of Kos,
<foreign rend="ital">de aere aquis et locis (Hippocr. opera,</foreign> vol. i.
ed. Kvehlewein, 1895), and the philosophy
of the reaction, with its practical concern
for the ideal city-state, does not fail to
realise that for the <foreign xml:lang="greek">po/lis kat' eu)xh/n</foreign> a
site, a climate, a race <foreign xml:lang="greek">kat' eu)xh/n</foreign> must
also be posited. Thucydides (more
clearly than Hdt.) mediates the action
of physics on politics through the
economic conditions (as in his <title>Archaiologia</title>):
this profounder analysis was
not lost in the sequel; Aristotle, for
example, not only generalizes (or preserves
the generalization) on the relation
between <foreign xml:lang="greek">trofh/</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">bi/os</foreign> (<title>Politics</title> 1. 8 =
1256 a), but traces in a fashion the merits
of the Greek nation to its happy position
between the barbarous extremes of cold
and heat, of Europe and Asia (<title>Pol.</title> 4 (7).
7 = 1327 b). It stands to reason that
the lesser differences between one Greek
folk and another might be in part traceable
to differences in the physicogeographical
environment; and as a
matter of fact the popular philosophy of
Greece early ascribed the superiority of
the Attic race to the advantages of its
climate, traced the genesis of political
parties to features in the Atticlandscape—
the shore, the plain, the mountain—
or ascribed the development of the
democracy (somewhat superficially) to
the growing importance of the sea, and
sea-power, in the life of the city. Livy
(38. 17) puts a speech into the mouth
of Cn. Manlius (A.U.C. 565) on the
Gallograeci, which might be taken as a
commentary on this text; but in general
the Roman conqueror believed in race
(<foreign rend="ital">fortes creantur fortibus</foreign>), and under the
cosmopolitan rule of Rome, whether
imperial or pontifical, much of the sense
of the relativity of human institutions
passed out of consciousness, to be
rediscovered and reintroduced with the
revival of Greek letters and the return
to nature. The idea is now a commonplace
of every history of civilisation,
or philosophy of history; but an initial
place in the bibliography of the subject
must always be reserved for Montesquieu's
<title>Esprit des Lois,</title> 1748 (Livres
xiv.-xviii.), as also for Buckle's <title>Hist.
of Civilization in England</title> (1857), c. ii.
The <foreign rend="ital">regnum hominis,</foreign> much as it has
advanced in our own day, has not yet
succeeded in completely emancipating
Man from the physico-geographical conditions
of polity; climate, soil, structure,
position, and even physical aspect, are
permanent though modifiable factors in
the life and character of the race.</p></div>

As history, this statement is hardly
correct; the ‘Persian folk’ may have
remained in Persis proper, but the
nobles certainly came down into the
richer and civilized portions of the
empire to a considerable extent; and the
dynasty resided as a rule less in Pasargadai
(Persia proper) than in Susa (Elam)
<pb n="831"/>
or Ekbatana (Media), or Babylon. As
geography, the description of Persis
proper is unduly severe; though <title>Fars</title>
might compare ill with Babylonia, or
even Susiana (cp. E. Meyer, <title>G. d.
Alterth.</title> iii. (1901) p. 18). As argument,
the conclusion looks, at first sight, oddly
infelicitous for the last word of a record,
which has exhibited in unsparing colours
the attempt of the Persians to extend
their empire over Hellas, an attempt
ending in failure and flight, the prelude
to further loss and forfeiture. But
something else is in Hdt.'s mind.
<title>Mutato nomine fabula narratur.</title> He is
too delicate to dictate to the Greeks, or
it may be to the Athenians; but the
lesson is there for those who have ears to
hear. It is at once the rationale of the
Greek success, and a call to future expansion.
The men <foreign xml:lang="greek">luprh\n oi)ke/ontes</foreign>, the
nurslings of poverty (7. 102) and hard
fare (9. 82)—theirs is the victory, and
theirs the empire, if they will: what the
Persians had done in the days of Kyros,
why should not the Greeks do in the
days of Kimon, or of Perikles?</p>
<p>Such a moral belongs to a period long
before the Peloponnesian war, and fits
in well with the many other evidences
that the story of the Great Invasion of
480-79 B.C. was composed early in the
period of Hdt.'s literary labours. This
anecdote, which conveys, in dramatic
form, the rationale and the moral of the
war, no doubt in the first instance was
designed as the conclusion of Bks. 7, 8,
9, though it now serves as the hardly
less appropriate colophon to the whole
work. It is an anecdote which is
hardly consistent with the representation
of Kyros in Bk. 1, and especially of his
end: it seems to belong to one of those
other cycles of stories on the later years
of Kyros which Hdt. rejected when he
came to deal with the passing of Kyros
as itself an integral portion of his work
(cp. 1. 214 <foreign rend="ital">ad f.</foreign>).</p>
<p>It might even have been this finale to
his work, as originally conceived and
drafted, which led Hdt. back to the
investigations, <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/n te *ku=ron o(/stis e)w\n th\n
*kroi/sou a)rxh\n katei=le, kai\ tou\s *pe/rsas
o(/tew| tro/pw| h(gh/santo th=s *)asi/hs</foreign>, which
now bulk so large in Bk. 1. And thus,
indeed, to use Rawlinson's simile, ‘the
tail of the snake is curved round into his
mouth’ in the completed work of Hdt.,
which forms a whole now, with a clear
Beginning, Middle, and End. Historically
and artistically the work is complete
and concluded, though not, indeed,
equally or evenly finished throughout:
a phenomenon which the prior genesis of
the latest portion, and the subsequent
addition of the earlier, introductory, and
discursive parts, go some way to explain.
Blakesley, who, while recognizing the
earlier composition of the last three
Books, nevertheless holds the work to be
incomplete, questions the authenticity
of this chapter.</p></div></div></div>
