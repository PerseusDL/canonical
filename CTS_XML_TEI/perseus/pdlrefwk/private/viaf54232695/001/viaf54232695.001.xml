<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>The accompanying thirty plates are the first part of a publication planned to include eventually all the Attic vase paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts which deserve to be reproduced at their actual size. Black-figured paintings are not excluded by the title; but it is proposed to present first the more significant works of the century from 530 to 430 B.C. in which the red-figured style flourished at Athens. Since this is not a complete catalogue of the collection, it has seemed unnecessary to follow a rigid classification. But most of the sixty-five vases here illustrated in chronological sequence belong, from the point of view of style, to four clearly defined groups. Fifteen early archaic plates, cups, and lekythoi are reproduced on Plates I-IV and in figure 11. Plates VI-XIV are devoted to the Brygos painter and his school, including ten works of the master, three unpublished cups by the Foundry painter, and six school pieces. The group of the Villa Giulia painter is represented by two of his followers, the Chicago painter and the Euaion painter, the former by six vases, the latter by four (Plates XVI-XXI); all of these are here published for the first time. The only work in the Museum by the Villa Giulia painter himself is omitted because it is extensively repainted. Plates XXII-XXIX, with figures 41, 42, give seventeen vases of the group of the Achilles painter. These include three of his minor red-figured paintings and four of his white lekythoi, two paintings by the Dwarf painter, and three by the Phiale painter. An amphora by the Kleophrades painter (Plate V), two polychrome vases (Plate XV), and a lekythos by the Eretria painter (Plate XXX) have been added to complete the tale of plates. It is, I hope, unnecessary to add that these paintings have been selected for their intrinsic value, not because they have been attributed to this or that artist. No one will deny, however, that the appreciation of a work of art is increased by acquaintance with other closely related works. So, for example, each of the exquisite miniature drawings shown on Plate XVIII gains in interest when it is compared with its three companion-pieces on the same plate, with the pictures on Plates XVI-XVII, drawn by the same hand on a larger scale, and with the cups on Plates XIX-XXI, which are by a different artist of the same group.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The difficulty of reproducing the decoration of Attic vases in two dimensions is well known. Doubtless the best method is to give drawings supplemented by photographs of significant details. But competent draughtsmen are not easily found. Most of the illustrations on these plates are therefore photographic. The excellent drawings on Plates VI and XXX were made many years ago by the late F. Anderson. The rest of the drawings on the plates, as well as those reproduced in the text, have been made by myself. Their shortcomings are to some extent atoned for by the accompanying photographs. Some of the pictures are shown in two views; occasionally two or more photographs have been joined together. In a few cases I have strengthened the anatomical markings in pencil on the photographic prints. But otherwise the collotypes have been made directly from the original negatives and have not been subjected to any retouching which affects the pictures.</p>

<p>No one who works in this field at the present day can avoid being under a heavy obligation to Professor Beazley. But in this case my debt to him is so great that I have asked him to allow his name to appear on the title-page. He has encouraged me in the undertaking from the outset, and has supervised the preparation of the plates. I am responsible for the form of the text and, to a large extent, for its content; but before writing it I had the benefit of discussing every piece with him during two visits to Oxford, and I have incorporated in it much information derived from him. The attributions of <pb xml:id="i.vi" n="vi"/> paintings which are made here for the first time are all his, as well as most of those which have been proposed before. Besides furnishing a discussion of the pyxis <ref target="no.37" n="U">no. 37</ref> (<rs key="Boston 98.887" type="Vase">Boston 98.887</rs>), and offering shorter comments, he has read the text both in manuscript and in proof, and has improved it in many ways.</p>

<p>I should like also to express here my gratitude to Mr. John Johnson, Printer of the University, for his valuable co-operation and for the friendly interest which he has taken in the publication.</p>

<p>Diameter, 0.189 m. Broken, and a few pieces missing. The only noteworthy restoration of the picture is that of the left elbow of Herakles. The vase has been cleaned since its first publication; some details in Hauser's drawing (the projecting brim of Hermes' cap and the hair over his forehead, the end of the bow seen against the arm of Herakles) probably reproduce restorations which are now removed. A fracture running obliquely downwards past the profile of Hermes has been repaired in antiquity with three clamps, the holes for which remain. It has damaged the profile hardly at all. The shape of the plate and the decoration of its lower surface with rings of black glaze are shown in figure 1. The base-ring is pierced to hold a cord for suspension. Relief contours practically throughout; exceptions: the paws of Kerberos, parts of the feet of Herakles and Hermes, the ends of the fingers of Hermes' right hand, some of the contours of the fingers of his left hand, the lower edge of Herakles' chiton. The hair contours reserved. Raised dots along the edges of the hair above the foreheads. The interstices between the locks on the back of the neck of Kerberos indented with a bluntly pointed tool. No anatomical markings in brown; details of the ears of Kerberos and lines on his noses in thinned black, turning to brown. Red used for the chain of Kerberos, for his tongue, and for the claws of the hind-paws of the lion-skin.</p>

<p>Formerly in the Bourguignon collection, and probably identical with a plate from Chiusi mentioned in <title>Bull. d. Inst.</title> 1851, p. 171: 'tra cinque piatti sono notabili pel soggetto, uno che mostra Ercole con Cerbero...' (Hartwig). <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1901, p. 33, no. 7.

<p>'The lively group of three figures is composed within a reserved circle upon a ground line placed so high that it cuts off nearly a third of the circumference. In the exergue, a vertical palmette between lotus flowers growing from the spirals at its base. Herakles, moving to right in a long stride, his head turned back, his advanced left leg sharply bent, his right leg almost extended behind him, exerts his strength to pull Kerberos along by a chain which he grasps with his right hand, while in his left he holds his bow above his head. The monster's reluctance is expressed by the position of his front legs. His hindquarters are out of the picture, suggesting, as Hartwig has remarked, that he is just emerging from the house of Hades. In the background between Herakles and Kerberos, Hermes advances more nimbly, his kerykeion in his right hand, his left lifted in a gesture of excitement. Herakles is beardless.<note anchored="true" n="i.1.1"><p>This is noted by Hartwig as unusual in Attic art of the time. He gives other instances.</p></note> He wears a short chiton, and over it a lion-skin tied about his neck and fitting snugly about his waist, where it is confined by a girdle. The tail is tucked under the girdle. His quiver hangs at his back. Hermes, bearded and with <pb xml:id="i.2" n="2"/> long hair, wears a pointed felt cap with brim turned up, a chiton, and a small mantle hung over his arms. The hilt of his sword appears at his side. Kerberos is represented with two heads, as regularly in Attic vase painting, and a shaggy neck.</p>

<p>This vase and the succeeding one, <ref target="no.2" n="U">no. 2</ref> (<rs key="Boston 03.785" type="Vase">Boston 03.785</rs>), belong to a series of seven plates assigned by Beazley to one artist, whom he has appropriately named the Kerberos painter. In <title>Att. V.</title>, l.c., he adds to the list of his works two vases of different shapes in Athens, and, tentatively, the famous Miltiades plate at Oxford, <title>Corpus</title>, Oxford, I, Pl. 1, no. 5. Four of the plates depict mythological scenes in a lively and interesting style. The one formerly in the Blaydes collection, with Io, Hermes, and Argos, had already been connected with the Kerberos plate by Hartwig; and the drawing of it in <title>A.Z.</title> 1847, Pl. 2, leaves no doubt as to the correctness of the attribution. One of the two plates at Yale, Baur, <title>Stoddard Collection</title>, no. 169, Pl. 15, also contains three figures (Athena, Kassandra, Aias). The plate in the Louvre, (<rs key="Louvre G 67" type="Vase">Louvre G 67</rs>), Pottier, <title>Album</title>, Pl. 96 (better: photo Giraudon), shows Theseus killing the Minotaur.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The style of the Kerberos painter is still strongly under the influence of black-figured vase painting. It is not difficult to imagine the scene on our plate exactly duplicated in black figure, just as one and the same scene is treated in the two styles on some of the amphorae of Andokides. The diminutive figure of Kassandra on the plate at Yale also recalls black-figured pictures, as Pfuhl has noted. In early archaic representations of the rape she is apt to be very small, perhaps because the artists wished to emphasize the atrocity of the deed by making her very young. And Hartwig calls attention to the rendering of details in the Kerberos plate: 'The fine dots on the lion-skin of Herakles, on the sword-hilt of Hermes and on the head of Kerberos, the handling of the edges of garments and of the separate locks of the mane of the two-headed dog equal in their subtlety the engraving on black-figured vases.' The relief lines, where they appear against the red ground, show the artist's mastery of the medium. But in rendering the contours he is less careful. Relying on the fact that they will be hidden, he sometimes makes the lines thick, or draws double lines, or, in a few places, omits them. In this respect he does not reach the standard of Epiktetos in the pictures of silens (<ref target="no.5" n="U">no. 5</ref> [<rs key="Boston 95.34" type="Vase">Boston 95.34</rs>] and 6 [<rs key="Boston 10.212" type="Vase">Boston 10.212</rs>]) or of the painter of the archer (<ref target="no.8" n="U">no. 8</ref>; <rs key="Boston 00.336" type="Vase">Boston 00.336</rs>). In these three works all the contours are drawn in clean strokes as if they were to be visible. The Kerberos painter in most cases uses the reserved hair contour. But Xenophon and Dorotheos on the plate <ref target="no.2" n="U">no. 2</ref> (<rs key="Boston 03.785" type="Vase">Boston 03.785</rs>) have their hair contours incised. And the interstices between the locks of their fringes are incised, or indented like those of the mane of Kerberos. Their names also are incised. Incised details occur also in the Miltiades plate: the bowstring, the reins where they appear against the black ground, and the outlines of the horse's tail.</p>

<p>Beazley is inclined to think that we have a black-figured work by the Kerberos painter: fragments of a white-ground plaque in Athens, <rs key="Athens, Acr. 2584" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 2584</rs>, Graef-Langlotz, <title>Akropolisvasen</title>, Pl. 109, and he adds, as probably by him, fragments, some in Florence, some in the Villa Giulia, of a cup with Herakles and Geryon.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(from Addenda to Part I) No. 1. <title>ARV.</title> p. 55, Cerberus Painter no. 6.

<p>Diameter, 0.19 m. Broken, but complete. The surface worn, so that details of the figures are dimmed or lost. Shape like <ref target="no.1" n="U">no. 1</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8025" type="Vase">Boston 01.8025</rs>), but with variations outside, as shown in figure 2. The base-ring pierced for suspension.

<p>Two athletes in conversation. At the left Xenophon stands with his right leg advanced and his right hand extended towards his companion. His left arm is swung back, and the hand holds a discus. At the right Dorotheos stands facing him, his right leg advanced, his right hand extended. Apparently he is asking for the discus, while Xenophon gives <pb xml:id="i.3" n="3"/> him instructions as to its manipulation. In the field at the left, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*S*E*N*O*F*O*N</foreign>; at the right <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*O*R*O*Q*E*O*S</foreign>, neatly incised with a blunt tool.</p>

<p>By the Kerberos painter. See on <ref target="no.1" n="U">no. 1</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8025" type="Vase">Boston 01.8025</rs>) above. It is noteworthy that this plate was found with two others: the plate with the death of Argos, by the same painter, and a plate with a representation of a mounted 'Amazon', which, as Hartwig suggests,<note anchored="true" n="i.3.1"><p><title>Jahrbuch</title>, viii, 1893, p. 161, note 6.</p></note> may be identical with the Miltiades plate at Oxford. A fragment of a plate in London, <rs key="London E 138" type="Vase">London E 138</rs>, Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 14, fig. 6, is a pendant to our plate. It had two athletes.

<p>About 500 B.C. Called a later work of the Menon painter, by Beazley, l.c., but not included by him in <title>Att. V.</title> Hoppin's attribution of the painting to Euthymides has been rightly rejected by Beazley, <title>J.H.S.</title> xxxvii, 1917, p. 236. But it is noteworthy that the plate resembles the fragmentary plate in the Museo Bocchi which has the signature of Euthymides (Hoppin, i, p. 438, no. 5). Its contour is similar; it has the same chequered border; and the bottom of the base-ring is grooved in the same way.</p>

The figure, composed so as to fill almost completely the space within the single reserved circle, is contemporary with the Epiktetan silens, <ref target="no.5" n="U">no. 5</ref> and <ref target="no.6" n="U">no. 6</ref> on Plate III (<rs key="Boston 95.34" type="Vase">Boston 95.34</rs> and <rs key="Boston 10.212" type="Vase">Boston 10.212</rs>), but executed in a larger style.</p>

<p>'One of the minor works of Euthymides' (Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>). This attribution has been disputed by Hoppin (<title>Euthymides</title>, p. 92) on the unconvincing ground that the silen's head is larger in proportion to his body than is usual in Euthymidean figures. Two details mentioned by Beazley, <title>J.H.S.</title>, l.c., are highly characteristic: the collar-bones rendered by two lines with hooks at their inner ends, and the breast drawn in relief lines as two arcs, one extending upward to mark the sternum and both continued by smaller arcs on the arms. Moreover, the whole system of neatly executed anatomical markings is in the manner of Euthymides.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 4. <title>ARV.</title> p. 27, manner of Euthymides, no. 3.</p></note></p>

<p>A silen, holding a drinking-horn in his left hand, balances himself on a wine-skin which he is bestriding. His head, wreathed with ivy, is bald to the crown. Long locks of hair fall on his shoulders. His beard, too, is long, and his eyebrow bushy. His tail is reserved in the later manner. In the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*P*P*A*R*X*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. On the wine-skin, in brown, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*P*P*L*O*X*O</foreign>, probably the same name, though the alpha is without crossbar and the rho lacks its tail: the fifth letter cannot be meant for a lambda, as the Ionic lambda is unknown in Attic vase-painting at this time.</p>

<p>Convincingly ascribed to Epiktetos by Beazley, who connects it with the silen cup in Corneto, <title>Röm. Mitt.</title> v, 1890, p. 340, fig. 9, and regards both as late works. Since the career of the artist has been held to cover half a century, it is necessary to define what is meant by the word 'late' in this connexion.<note anchored="true" n="i.5.2"><p>Cf. Pfuhl, i, p. 342: 'Eine Malertätigkeit von etwa fünfzig Jahren, die ungefähr das letzte Viertel des 6 und das erste Viertel des 5 Jahrh. umfasst.' Langlotz, <title>Zeitbestimmung</title>, p. 117, makes his career last from the decade 520-510 to the decade 480-470.</p></note> His latest signed work, the pelike in Berlin, Hoppin, i, p. 303, no. 3, has been attributed by Beazley to the Kleophrades painter (<title>Att. V.</title>, p. 71, no. 23). And, however the signature be explained, the paintings show no trace of the style of Epiktetos, and can therefore be left out of account here. Apart from this vase there is no reason to bring his activity down later than about 500 B.C. — that is, to the beginnings of the ripe archaic style. His career may be supposed to have coincided approximately with the last quarter of the sixth century. Certain technical characteristics suggest that our cup, the cup in Corneto mentioned above, and the skyphos in London painted for Pistoxenos (<rs key="London E 139" type="Vase">London E 139</rs>; Hoppin, i, p. 319, no. 14) belong to the end of this period. On all three the silens have the hair contour reserved, whereas on other Epiktetan works the hair contour is almost invariably incised. The silens on the same three vases have tails rendered in the ground colour, whereas most other Epiktetan silens have tails in added red, like that of <ref target="no.6" n="U">no. 6</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.212" type="Vase">Boston 10.212</rs>) on Plate III. An exception is on the early cup painted for Pamphaios, <rs key="Berlin 2262" type="Vase">Berlin 2262</rs>, Hoppin, i, p. 305, no. 14. The full inner markings on the bodies in dilute glaze, which appear on the three vases, have also been taken as evidence for a late date.</p>

<p>If our cup was painted about 500 B.C. it has a bearing on the identification of the Hipparchos who is celebrated almost exclusively on Epiktetan vases. The name is found on two of his signed cups (<title>Att. V.</title>, p. 25, nos. 8 and 10), and five unsigned cups besides this (ibid. nos. 14, 16, 23, 24, and p. 29, no. 5), on another in his manner (ibid. p. 29, no. 15), and on still another with interior in his style and exterior in the style of the Euergides painter (ibid. p. 37). In his recent discussion of the name (<title>Zeitbestimmung</title>, p. 54) Langlotz defends the improbable identification of this Hipparchos with the son of Peisistratos. But if our cup was painted some fourteen years after his death, the name throws no light on the dating of Epiktetan works.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 5. <title>ARV.</title> p. 49, Epiktetos no. 58.

<p>A silen kneeling on his left knee, about to drink from a horn.</p>

<p>An admirable work of Epiktetos, interesting, besides, because of the bold foreshortening of the left leg, in which the influence of the new drawing of Euphronios and his companions is apparent. Cf. Antaios on the Louvre krater (<rs key="Louvre G 103" type="Vase">Louvre G 103</rs>), Palaisto and Agape on the <pb xml:id="i.6" n="6"/> Petrograd psykter, and Eurytion on the Geryon cup in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2620" type="Vase">Munich 2620</rs>). The inner markings in brown are also fuller than in most Epiktetan works. For those on the face, which make it appear 'wizened like a monkey's', compare the faces of the Egyptians on his Busiris cup in London, F.R., Pl. 73 (<rs key="London E 38" type="Vase">London E 38</rs>). This has been held to be a late work because of the drawing of one of the komasts on side B in rear view. But there is no need on this account to date either the Busiris cup or our fragment later than 500 B.C.<note anchored="true" n="i.6.1"><p>Cf. Langlotz, <title>Zeitbestimmung</title>, p. 113.</p></note> The incised hair contour and the red tail are still in the earlier archaic manner.<note anchored="true" n="i.6.2"><p>Epiktetos gives red tails to most of his silens, as well as to the horse on the plate in London, Hoppin, i, p. 315, no. 12 (<rs key="London E 136" type="Vase">London E 136</rs>).

<p>From Cervetri. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1913, p. 89.</p>

<p>A warrior leading off a woman, within a border consisting of a circle, reserved, as is also the exergue upon which the figures stand. He is about to move to the left, but turns his head back towards the woman, whom he grasps by the wrist with his left hand like a bridegroom conducting his bride, while he threatens her with a sword held in his right. She stands hesitant, looking at him, her lips parted, her left hand lifted slightly with the palm upward. He is armed with cuirass and Corinthian helmet and possibly with greaves. The shin of his frontal left leg was marked by a relief line, and there are traces of relief lines at his ankle. His left foot was seen in top view extending on to the exergue. The surface of his chiton is covered with a light brown wash, over which are dots in darker brown. His curly hair is indicated by raised black dots, one of which appears in the eye-hole of his helmet, others between its nose and cheek-pieces. The woman is richly garbed in Ionic chiton, himation, and bridal veil. She wears a diadem and a necklace with pendants. The folds of the veil are rendered in brown lines. The upper part of the chiton is decorated with rows of crosses in black, alternating with rows of short vertical strokes and dots in brown. Her upper eyelid is rendered by two lines.<note anchored="true" n="i.6.3"><p>Beazley remarks that the indication of the upper edge of the upper eyelid, rare in archaic painting (examples: the Sosias cup in Berlin, <rs key="Berlin F 2278" type="Vase">Berlin F 2278</rs>, and the Kleophrades cup in the Cabinet des Médailles), recurs on a vase of the Epidromos-Apollodoros group, <rs key="Athens, Acr. F 89a" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. F 89a</rs>. Two examples in Hartwig's <title>Meisterschalen</title> — the Perugia cup signed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Eufronios epoiesen</foreign> and the Villa Giulia cup with horses — are bogus, this detail being due to the restorer.</p></note></p>

<p>The threatening gesture of the warrior makes it probable that the subject is Menelaos leading away Helen, whom he has recovered after the fall of Troy.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The shape of the cup, the use of a reserved circle as border for the picture, the drawing of eyes and hands, the treatment of Helen's dress and mantle suggest a date near the end of the early archaic red-figured style, i.e. not far from the year 500 B.C. Three other cups. with the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos</foreign> name Elpinikos are cited by Klein, <title>L.I.</title> 2, p. 86. Beazley ascribes them to the same hand as ours and adds, as a fifth piece, a cup fragment in Leipsic, <rs key="Leipsic T 609" type="Vase">Leipsic T 609</rs> (interior, part of a youth bending). Klein's no. 1 is now in the Art Gallery at Manchester.

<p>A youthful archer standing in profile to right, with knees bent, feet far apart, head thrust forward, looks along an arrow to test its straightness, while with the forefinger of his left hand he tries its point. He is nude except for drapery about his middle. Its lower part hangs in groups of vertical folds. Above this the folds are wavy horizontal lines, suggesting that the sleeveless chiton, unpinned on the shoulders, has slipped down to the waist. A quiver hangs at the youth's left side from a cross-belt. He is wreathed, and his hair falls on his shoulder in very fine, straight lines. On the reserved exergue is the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, in relief lines.</p>

<p>520-510 B.C. The picture, beautifully composed and treating an interesting motive in a lively spirit, is remarkable also for the delicate and careful drawing of all the details, including the copious inner markings.

<p>Diameter, 0.165 m.; height, 0.074 m. Intact. Small kylix with offset lip and low stem moulded at the junction with the foot. Relief contours throughout.

<p>A warrior, nude, but characterized as an archer by his barbarian cap and by the quiver <pb xml:id="i.8" n="8"/> hanging at his side, crouches in a posture of defence holding a round shield before him. The rim of the shield is drawn in two incised circles, the outer one covered with a relief line. Its device is a galloping horseman in black.</p>

<p>On an early cup in Beazley's possession an archer in a similar pose is shooting an arrow. This is by the same hand as the crouching warrior holding out his shield on a cup fragment in Tübingen; he wears an Attic helmet but is otherwise nude.<note anchored="true" n="i.8.1"><p>Watzinger, <title>Griechische Vasen in Tübingen</title>, <rs key="Tbingen E 40" type="Vase">Tübingen E 40</rs>, Pl. 21.</p></note> The shield in our picture is hard to explain, as is the fact that its device is turned to the right instead of to the left, as is natural and usual. 'The only explanation is that the artist has not cared to give an accurate representation of anything in life; varying a figure which he has often drawn (very like, especially in the lower part, a warrior by him in Corneto, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 29, no. 9; now attributed to Epiktetos himself), he has combined incompatibles, and, to give his figure balance, has not hesitated to turn the shield-device the wrong way.'</p>

<p>A youth, in chiton, patterned chlamys, Thracian cap and boots, riding a horse to left. The left foreleg and the right hindleg of the horse rest on the ground, which is rendered by a reserved line. Details of the rider's knee and of the horse's body, mane and tail are drawn in relief lines. In the field the signature of the potter Hermaios, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E[*R]*M*A[*I*O*S *E*P*O*I*E*S*E]*N</foreign>.</p>

<p>This cup and the following one, <ref target="no.11" n="U">no. 11</ref> (<rs key="Boston 95.33" type="Vase">Boston 95.33</rs>), belong to a series of eight early archaic red-figured cups brought together by Beazley, in <title>Attische Vasenmaler</title>, under the heading 'the Hermaios Group'. A ninth, fragmentary cup in Heidelberg, added by Kraiker, <title>Arch. Anz.</title> xxxviii-xxxix, 1923-4, p. 165, is accepted by Beazley, <title>Corpus</title>, Oxford, i, p. 2, no. 4. Four of these were painted for Hermaios, two for Chachrylion, one for Chelis. Those with the signature of Hermaios may confidently be assigned to one artist, the Hermaios painter. So Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, l.c., followed by Pfuhl, i, p. 429. By him also are the two unsigned cups in Oxford, <title>Corpus</title>, l.c., and in Heidelberg, as well as the maenad cup with the signature of Chachrylion, since, as Beazley remarks, it cannot be separated from the Dionysos cup in Petrograd. The large cup in Munich signed by Chelis (<rs key="Munich 2589" type="Vase">Munich 2589</rs>), with pictures outside as well as within, is regarded by Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, l.c., as 'closely akin and perhaps by the same hand'. There remains the cup in the Louvre painted for Chachrylion, <title>Att. V.</title>, no. 6. Its authorship cannot readily be judged from the drawing reproduced by Hoppin, i, p. 169, no. 15.</p>

<p>Our cup recalls the other works of the painter in the rendering of the lips, the hands, the scalloped edges of the chiton, and especially in the quality of the very thin relief lines. The liberal use of these lines for inner markings is characteristic of him, and a very similar indication of the details of the knee occurs on nos. 5 and 7 in Beazley's list, as well as on the Heidelberg cup.</p>

<p>Height, 0.31 m.; diameter, 0.124 m. Broken, but repaired without appreciable injury to the picture. The neck of the lekythos, the top of the lip, and the edge of the upper member of the foot reserved. On the shoulder, below a tongue pattern, black palmettes in three groups, with single ivy-leaves in the field. Relief contours throughout. The hair contours reserved. Red used for the wreaths of the two youths, the branches they hold, the halters of the cows, the tassel at the end of the woman's fillet, the fillet tied about the column, two bands encircling the vase below the reserved ground line of the picture. The streamers hanging from the cows' horns are of alternate red and white tufts. The faint inner markings in brown are indicated in the drawing, which is, however, to be corrected in two particulars: the three wavy tresses showing against the woman's neck are not painted, but indented: they belong to the preliminary sketch, and should therefore have been omitted. The same remark applies to the line indicating the jaw of the first youth.</p>

<p>From Gela. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1913, p. 90. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 26. Hoppin, i, p. 462, no. 1. Pfuhl, i, p. 429. Jacobsthal, <title>Ornamente griechischer Vasen</title>, Pl. 54 a. The shape is given in Hambidge, <title>Dyn. Sym.</title>, p. 131, fig. 10, and Caskey, <title>G.G.V.</title>, p. 212, no. 166.</p>

<p>The picture, which covers most of the circumference of the lekythos, shows a gay festal procession advancing towards a sacred precinct indicated by an Ionic column. Preceded by a woman bearing a large, high-handled ceremonial basket on her head, two youths are leading two cows to the sacrifice. The kanephoros has her head bound by a broad fillet with a red tassel at its end, and she is richly garbed in an Ionic chiton embroidered with crosses and a large himation. Two ends of this are laid over the woman's shoulders and hang almost to the ground in elaborate, symmetrically arranged zigzag folds. But the artist has failed to visualize this arrangement of the drapery, for some of the folds begin at the shoulders, others below the sleeves of the chiton (as if the mantle were hanging behind the arms), while the pinned upper edges of the sleeves are shown from neck to elbow. The mantle of Anakreon on the lekythos by the same painter, referred to below, is worn in the same way; but in this case its folds are correctly carried up over the shoulder. The sacrificial basket with three high loop-handles is familiar from many vase paintings as well as from terra-cotta models.<note anchored="true" n="i.10.1"><p>See especially Deubner, 'Hochzeit und Opferkorb', <title>Jahrbuch</title>, xl, 1925, pp. 250 ff.</p></note> The youths are wreathed, and wear mantles disposed so as to leave the right arm and shoulder bare. They carry branches (<foreign xml:lang="greek">qalloi\</foreign>), the first in his left, the second in both hands. The halters (or possibly one long rope) tied about the horns of the cows are held in the raised right hand of the first youth and in the left hand of the second. Long streamers composed of tufts of red and white wool hang from the victims' horns. The Ionic column, set on a nondescript two-stepped base and having a plinth below the volutes of its capital, is decorated for the festival with a red fillet tied about its shaft.<note anchored="true" n="i.10.2"><p>The column on the black-figured lekythos cited below is similarly adorned. The forked iron pins in the bolsters of the capitals of the North Porch of the Erechtheum are thought to have served to secure garlands or other decorations at festivals; cf. Stevens-Paton, <title>The Erechtheum</title>, p. 83.</p></note> The space below the handle of the lekythos, between the two ends of the <pb xml:id="i.11" n="11"/> procession, is filled with a floral design composed of four large palmettes and two lotus flowers.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>On a fragmentary black-figured lekythos from the Acropolis, published by Langlotz, <title>Akropolisvasen</title>, no. 2298, Pl. 96, and dated by him early in the fifth century, the same subject is represented in greater detail (see fig. 9, Suppl. Pl. I).<note anchored="true" n="i.11.1"><p>In <title>B.S.R.</title> xi, 1929, p. 12, no. 15, Beazley assigns this lekythos to the 'Edinburgh painter'.</p></note> A cow with a fillet hanging from its horns is being led to the sacrifice; the worshippers carry branches; there is a kanephoros with a three-handled basket on her head; the column with a fillet tied about it reappears, supporting in this case a rudimentary triglyph frieze. Within the temple thus indicated a worshipper stands before a striding figure of Athena. The close correspondence between the two scenes makes it certain that ours represents a sacrifice to the same divinity.<note anchored="true" n="i.11.2"><p>The sex of the animals suggests a goddess; and only female victims were offered to Athena. Cf. Stengel, <title>Die Griech. Kultusaltertümer</title>, p. 152.</p></note> The picture, which looks like an archaic forerunner of the Parthenon frieze, may thus actually portray a group from the Panathenaic procession. A third picture much like ours is on a Boeotian lekanis in London (<rs key="London B 80" type="Vase">London B 80</rs>: <title>J.H.S.</title> i, pl. 7; <title>Corpus</title>, B.M. III He, pl. 7, 4: see A. D. Ure in <title>J.H.S.</title> 49, p. 167): here also the deity is Athena.</p>

<p>Painted in black letters running round the lip of the lekythos is the signature of the potter Gales: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*G*A*L*E*S *E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>.<note anchored="true" n="i.11.3"><p>For other instances of inscriptions on the upper surface of the mouth of a vase see Beazley, <title>Corpus</title>, Oxford, i, p. 43, Pl. 49, 15.</p></note> This signature occurs in the same place on another lekythos, also found at Gela, which is almost an exact duplicate of ours as regards shape and subsidiary decoration.<note anchored="true" n="i.11.4"><p>In Syracuse. Orsi, <title>Mon. Ant.</title> xix, 1909, pp. 102-115, figs. 9, 10, Pl. III. Hoppin, i, p. 464, no. 2.</p></note> Its badly preserved picture — Anakreon with lyre accompanied by two youthful revellers — is by the same hand, as Beazley has observed, but less finely drawn. The stiff, angular bodies of the two youths show that the painter was not abreast of the athletic movement inaugurated at the close of the sixth century. He is more successful in his rendering of the long-robed Ionic poet. But it remained for the Boston lekythos to reveal his real power and individuality. Beazley places him in the neighbourhood of Euthymides, and notes that the kylix at Yale (Baur, <title>The Stoddard Collection</title>, no. 163, Pl. XV) shows very close resemblances to his style.<note anchored="true" n="i.11.5"><p>A paragraph is devoted to the Gales painter by Pfuhl, <title>Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen</title>, p. 429. He regards the two lekythoi as obviously by the same hand. Langlotz, <title>Zeitbestimmung</title>, p. 41, note 4, tentatively assigns a cup in Würzburg, Urlichs, iii, no. 288, to him; but this attribution is not accepted by Beazley.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The lekythos, which is to be dated not later than 510 B.C., is one of a very small group painted in the early red-figured style. As Beazley has remarked, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 26, the bloom of the red-figured lekythos came later, in the ripe archaic period, when a more slender and graceful shape had been developed and the picture was limited to one or two figures. Apparently lekythoi continued for the most part to be decorated in black figure throughout the early archaic red-figured period. The exceptions include, besides the two Gales vases, the fine little lekythos in Girgenti with soldiers arming which stands close to them in style,<note anchored="true" n="i.11.6"><p>Published by Politi, <title>Un Leckitos</title> (Palermo, 1840), and by Gábrici in <title>Atti della R.

<p>Four athletes practising events of the pentathlon under the direction of a trainer. At the left end of the picture a goal-post set on a plinth, with a red fillet tied about it. From this a youth advances to right, holding jumping-weights in his extended hands. Next, a youth running to left, about to throw a javelin which he holds in his raised <emph>left</emph> hand.<note anchored="true" n="i.12.1"><p>The intention of the artist undoubtedly was, as Beazley remarks, to have the youth hold the javelin with his right hand; but, having drawn the left, i.e. the nearer, leg advanced, he became confused and filled in the breast as though it were a back. The action was meant to be like that of the javelin thrower on an amphora by the Eucharides painter in Brussels, F.R. iii, p. 268, fig. 126. That figure, however, advances the right, or farther leg.</p></note> Then a youth moving to right, holding a discus before him with both hands. Then a youth running to right with head turned back, three javelins in his right hand, his left arm raised. Facing him a bearded trainer, wreathed and wearing an himation decorated with dots in groups of three, holding out a long stick.

<p>Height, 0.454 m.; diameter, 0.281 m. Of Panathenaic shape. Intact. The exterior, except for the top of the lip, covered with black glaze, which has turned greenish in the firing. The sparing use of relief contours is clearly indicated in Beazley's drawings, <title>J.H.S.</title> xxxvi, 1916, pp. 130, 131, figs. 5 A and B. The following parts of the contours are in relief: on side A, the profile, the neck, part of the right elbow, the triangle formed by the back with the left arm, the right hand, the feet, the hare, the aryballos with its strap; on side B, the profile, the front line of the neck, both hands, the lower outline of the right forearm and part of that of the left, both feet (except the top of the left), the left leg, the front line of the right leg. The hair contours incised. Red used for the three wreaths, the fillets of the athlete, the cords by which the hare and the aryballos, are suspended. Brown used for the whiskers of both youths, the iris of the friend's eye, anatomical markings on both figures, the hare's fur. The character of the athlete's face is lost in the drawing, but is well shown in the photograph.</p>

<p>The powerfully built, long-legged youth on the obverse is characterized as an athletic victor by the fillets tied about his left arm and thigh. He is loaded with gifts from admiring friends: a hare, still alive to judge from its wide-open eyes and contracted hind-legs, a long knotted walking-stick, and an aryballos. These friends are represented by the draped youth on the reverse, who is offering him a wreath.</p>

<p>Height, 0.241 m.; width (handle to handle), 0.27 m. Broken, but nearly complete. The chief injuries are to the heads of Aegina on side A and Zeus on side B. The surface painted black without and within, except for a narrow strip at the rim, the edge and lower surface of the foot, and two lines bordering the moulding at the top of the stem, which are reserved. The offset edge of the lower member of the bowl is decorated with a tongue pattern. Relief contours throughout, except for the hair. Red used for the fillet and girdle of Aegina on side A, for the soles and straps of Zeus' sandals and the fillet of Ganymede on side B. Brown used on side A for the hair of Aegina, the body hair of Zeus, the folds of the upper part of Aegina's chiton and those of the back portion of the skirt, the details of the palm tree; on side B for the body hair of Zeus and the spots on his gaiters; also for the anatomical markings on the three male figures and for the sterno-mastoid muscle of Aegina. The full-size illustrations on the plate are from F. Anderson's excellent drawings, which have already been reproduced in colour by Tarbell and Tonks. In the drawing of side A some brown folds of the upper part of Aegina's chiton on the left side have been accidentally omitted.</p>

<p>A. Zeus, wearing an himation and holding a sceptre in his left hand, rushes to left in pursuit of Aegina, who flees from him with head turned back, stretching out her left hand in a deprecatory gesture. With her right hand she pulls up her Ionic chiton, exposing her advanced left leg. An himation hangs from her shoulders. Her long, fair hair is gathered up into a bunch, and tied with a red, triple-ended fillet. A red girdle, also with triple ends, appears below the kolpos of the dress. The right end of the picture is occupied by an altar, with a palm tree behind it.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>B. Zeus, wearing himation, sandals, and gaiters, and carrying an obliquely striped sceptre, pursues Ganymede, an immature boy, who runs to right with head turned back, his himation hanging from his left shoulder and right forearm, a hoop and stick in his left hand. The sandals of Zeus are elaborately laced with red thongs; the 'gaiters', encasing his legs from ankle to calf, are painted with dabs of brown.<note anchored="true" n="i.14.1"><p>Tarbell suggests that they may be bandages wound about the legs and held in place by cords (indicated in black).

<p>The identification of the woman on side A results from a process of elimination. The heroines of Zeus' amatory adventures are generally recognizable from some element of the story which the vase painter could not fail to represent; in this case she is not Europa or Danae or Semele, and therefore, in all probability, Aegina. The pursuit of Ganymede is commonly represented in red-figured vase-paintings, as, for example, on the fragmentary kantharos from the Acropolis referred to below, which is also by the Brygos painter. The frequent introduction of an altar into scenes of abduction has been noted by Jahn. 'According to him it means that the event is thought of as taking place at a religious festival, and it reflects the fact that on such occasions Greek girls had a liberty of public appearance not usually accorded to them.'<note anchored="true" n="i.14.2"><p>Tarbell, p. 4, note 4, quoting Jahn, <title>Archäologische Aufsätze</title>, p. 149.</p></note></p>

<p>490-480 B.C. A masterpiece of the Brygos painter.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>Actual examples of the kantharos are comparatively rare among Attic black-figured and red-figured vases, though this style of drinking-cup is represented with great frequency in vase paintings of both styles as well as on coins. Tarbell suggested that 'the form, like several others used for pottery, was designed for metal, and that the representations in art were often intended to be understood as of metal'. Pfuhl regards this explanation as obvious.<note anchored="true" n="i.14.3"><p><title>Malerei und Zeichnung der Griechen</title>, i, p. 304, 314.</p></note> But the phenomenon is accounted for in a simpler way by Beazley: the kantharos, being the drinking-cup especially associated with Dionysos, was naturally depicted in bacchic scenes, whereas the small number of extant examples shows no more than that it was not in common use as a wine-cup at Athens. Moreover, the clay kantharoi which have been found in great numbers in Boeotia cannot be regarded as cheap substitutes for cups normally made of metal. On the other hand, it is certain that there were metal kantharoi, and that their forms influenced the clay examples. And our kantharos, with its unusually slender stem and thin, concave handles, certainly suggests such influence.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The history of the kantharos in Greek pottery remains to be written. Here it must suffice to mention the varieties of the type occurring in Attic black-figured and red-figured ware. Beazley, in <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 4, distinguishes four types. Our vase belongs to his form A, which may be called A 1 to distinguish it from a type, A 2, with differently constructed handles. It can be traced back to the middle of the sixth century, for an early black- <pb xml:id="i.15" n="15"/> figured Attic kantharos in London<note anchored="true" n="i.15.1"><p><rs key="London 94.7-18.1." type="Vase">London 94.7-18.1.</rs> <title>J.H.S.</title> xviii, 1898, p. 289, fig. 3; Pls.

Another example is in Florence, <rs key="Florence no. 3887" type="Vase">Florence no. 3887</rs>; and among the black-figured fragments from the Acropolis there are some bits of kantharoi, though none is sufficiently preserved to establish its shape completely.

<p>Height, 0.145 m.; diameter, 0.179 m. Broken, but preserved nearly complete, the only extensive lacuna being at the lower part of the figure of the trainer on side B. Relief lines used for the contours throughout, red paint for the fillets of the boy on side A and the trainer on side B, for the wreath of the trainer on side A, and for the strings of the oil-flasks. Thinned varnish represents the fair hair of the boy on side A, the whiskers of the athlete on side A, and of the trainer on side B, the hair on the chest of the bearded trainer, the holes in the sponges, the texture of the bags, the zigzag pattern on the cushion of the stool, as well as the faint inner markings on the bodies. In filling in the background the painter has obliterated the tips of the rods held by the trainers and the notched end of the strigil. The relief lines show the rod on side A extending nearly to the chest of the athlete, while that on side B rested on the ground.</p>

<p>The drawings on the two sides of the skyphos represent the same subject — an athlete practising with <emph>halteres</emph> under the direction of a trainer; but monotony is skilfully avoided by variations in the actions and poses of the figures and by a different choice and arrangement of the accessories.</p>

<p>On side A a youth is shown in a typical attitude of the long jump. His weight is on his bent right leg; his left is extended, with the ball of the foot touching the ground; his arms, with leaden <emph>halteres</emph> grasped in the hands, are swung forward to a little above the horizontal; his body is drawn back to maintain an equilibrium. The moment represented is at the end of the preliminary upward swing of the weights — the third stage in the Greek running long jump, as it has been convincingly reconstructed by E. Norman Gardiner.<note anchored="true" n="i.18.3"><p><title>J.H.S.</title> xxiv, 1904, p. 189. His summary is worth quoting here:
</p>
<p>1. The jumper starts with arms bent, and elbows close to the side.
</p>
<p>2. He takes a short run, holding the halteres to the front.
</p>
<p>3. <title>On nearing the bater he checks himself by throwing the body back, immediately swinging the halteres upwards and making a slow stride forward.</title>
</p>
<p>4. With the next stride he swings them sharply <pb xml:id="i.19" n="19"/> downwards, bending the body and the front leg as the arms descend.
</p>
<p>5. On the return swing he takes off, shooting both legs to the front, so that arms and legs are nearly parallel.
</p>
<p>6. Before alighting he forces the arms vigorously backwards.
</p>
<p>Gardiner, p. 184, cites several representations of the third position in vase paintings as well as on the Berlin discus, Baumeister, <title>Denkmäler</title>, fig. 612, and the British Museum discus, <title>Catalogue of the Bronzes</title>, no. 248, fig. 10 = Walters, <title>The Art of the Greeks</title>, Pl. CV. A close parallel to the figure on the skyphos is on the kylix in Boston illustrated below, <ref target="no.34" n="U">no. 34</ref>, Pl. XIII (<rs key="Boston 01.8075" type="Vase">Boston 01.8075</rs>). In all these cases it can hardly be doubted that the athlete is practising the jump rather than merely using the weights in dumb-bell exercises.</p></note> That the athlete is not actually executing a jump, but practising the motions, is shown by the action of the trainer, who stands facing him, leaning forward on his knotted stick, and holding out a long rod to emphasize the instructions he is giving. A small, fair-haired boy standing behind the jumper is also an interested spectator. With his left hand he holds the athlete's walking-stick, with his right his oil-bottle and sponge. Between the principal figures a pair of rods are shown stuck in the ground. These are javelins, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ko/ntia</foreign>, as on the kylix, <ref target="no.34" n="U">no. 34</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8075" type="Vase">Boston 01.8075</rs>), described below, where the throwing-strap, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gku/lh</foreign>, is shown bound round the shaft. The presence of these rods in the picture possibly has some definite significance: they may serve as guides to the jumper during the preliminary stages before the take-off. But, in view of their frequent appearance in athletic scenes, it seems more probable that they were merely intended to suggest the palaestra. A sling-shaped bag of leather with the fur left on it, hanging behind the athlete, suggests another event of the pentathlon. It was the usual receptacle for the discus, whereas jumping-weights were simply tied together.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>On side B the positions of the athlete and the trainer are reversed. The former stands in profile to left, with his right leg advanced and his body bent forward slightly. His hands, holding a pair of heavy, stone <emph>halteres</emph>,<note anchored="true" n="i.19.1"><p>Both this, the earlier type of <emph>halter</emph>, and the later, lighter type, made of lead, carried by the jumper on side A, are known from numerous extant specimens which are fully discussed by Jüthner, <title>Antike Turngeräthe</title>, pp. 3-10, figs. 1-10. Cf. also Gardiner, in <title>J.H.S.</title> xxiv, 1904, p. 183, and in <title>Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals</title>, pp. 298 ff., figs. 60-2. A marble <emph>halter</emph> recently found at Sparta and published by Woodward, <title>B.S.A.</title> xxvii, p. 252, is at an intermediary stage, approaching in shape to the leaden type.</p></note> are lowered, one being swung out to the front, the other to the rear. The action is in this case less clear; but probably the athlete is taking up his position for the preliminary short run at a spot marked by the crossed rods. He is measuring with his eye the ground to be traversed, but has not swung the left-hand weight to the front beside the other. The youthful trainer, wearing himation and shoes, leans upon a knotted staff propped under his left arm-pit and grasps a long rod with his right hand. The athlete's mantle is laid on a stool behind him, and above it his strigil, sponge, and aryballos are suspended. Behind the trainer is a pick used to loosen the ground of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ska/mma</foreign>, or landing-place for the jump, and a discus bag hangs above.</p>

<p>Unquestionably from the hand of the Brygos painter, and, indeed, to be ranked as one of his masterpieces, the decoration of this skyphos is also noteworthy as the first representation of athletic exercises by him which has yet come to light. A kylix in Copenhagen<note anchored="true" n="i.19.2"><p>Thorvaldsen Museum, <rs key="Copenhagen, Thorvaldsen Museum 112" type="Vase">Copenhagen, Thorvaldsen Museum 112</rs>. Gerhard, <title>A.V.</title>, Pl. 281. Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 179, no. 38.</p></note> has shown that the artist at one period of his career recorded his impressions of scenes in the palaestra. Its subject is athletes and trainers conversing. One of the youths is scraping himself with a strigil; another holds a pair of jumping-weights. The locality is suggested by two Doric columns; athletic paraphernalia hang on the wall; there are two pairs of crossed rods; a stool with a mantle laid on it is almost a duplicate of the one on the skyphos. Another Brygan cup, in Boston, published below, <ref target="no.28" n="U">no. 28</ref>, Pl.

<p>In this work the Brygos painter, avoiding the representation of violent movement for which he is famous, reveals all the more conspicuously his gift for making his figures appear alive and significant. The long-legged, powerfully built athletes, standing out clearly against the black ground, seem to exist in three dimensions. This is due in part to the three-quarter view of their bodies and to the inner markings, but chiefly to the masterly drawing of their contours. And the delightfully characteristic figure of the small boy is, as Beazley has remarked, 'one of the first, one of the only, real children in vase painting'.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 18. <title>ARV.</title> p. 253, Brygos Painter no. 131; one figure (after Caskey), Jacobsthal <title>Diskoi</title> p. 3; (after Caskey) Chase <title>Guide</title> p. 69.</p></note></p>

<p>Height, 0.30 m.; diameter, 0.186 m. Broken and repaired with only slight injury to the pictures. A Nolan amphora with triple handles, the foot small, the ovoid body broader than usual, the ration of diameter to height being 1.000 to 1.618; cf. Caskey, <title>G.G.V.</title>, p. 75, where the ratios of twelve other Nolan amphorae in Boston are shown to vary from 1.6545 to 1.9045. The exterior painted black, except for a narrow strip at the bottom of the foot and two narrow bands bordering the moulding at the base of the body, which are reserved. Relief contours throughout, except for the hair. Red used for the fillet of the lyre player, the wreath of the listener, the fasteners of the lyre-strings, the two extra strings hanging from the lyre, the cord and tassel of the plectrum, the inscriptions. Thinned paint used for the shading of the bosses on the lyre, for the circles on the cloth hanging from it, and for the neck-muscle of the citharode.</p>

<p>From Gela. Acquired in 1926. <title>Bull. M.F.A.</title> xxiv, 1926, p. 39. Cf. Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 23, note 2.</p>

<p>On the front, a youth standing in profile to right with head thrown back and mouth open, singing and playing the cithara. His head is encircled by a fillet, and he wears a long Ionic chiton embroidered with crosses, a short black-bordered mantle fastened on his right shoulder, and soft leather shoes. He holds the instrument against his left shoulder with the help of a strap passed round his left wrist from one of the uprights. With the fingers of this hand he touches the strings lightly as he sings. His right hand holds the plectrum ready for striking louder notes in the intervals of the song. The plectrum is decorated with a red tassel, and is fastened to the arm of the cithara by a long cord. Two other cords fastened at the same place perhaps represent spare strings. The ends of a long cloth, decorated with circles, which would be wrapped about the more delicate parts of the instrument when it was not in use, hang from it. The significance of the curved object appearing beside the youth's left hand is obscure. The instrument is the large cithara of complicated structure played by Apollo himself and by performers at musical contests.<note anchored="true" n="i.20.1"><p>On the cithara see Th. Reinach's article, <emph>lyra</emph>, in Daremberg-Saglio, <title>Dictionnaire des Antiquités</title>.</p></note> One detail is noteworthy: the convexity of the large bosses on its arms is indicated by shading in thinned paint, such as is often found in Brygan renderings of still-life. In the field, the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O[*P]*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>On the reverse of the amphora a youth, wreathed, wrapped in a voluminous himation, and wearing shoes, stands in a relaxed pose, leaning on a knotted stick, his bowed head resting on his hand. He is not merely a decorative figure, such as often appears on the reverse of Nolan amphorae. He represents the audience; passive in attitude and facial expression, he yields himself up completely to the enjoyment of the music. In the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A[*L]*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>About 480 B.C. By the Brygos painter; closely related in style to <ref target="no.18" n="U">no. 18</ref> and <ref target="no.28" n="U">no. 28</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.176" type="Vase">Boston 10.176</rs> and <rs key="Boston 01.8038" type="Vase">Boston 01.8038</rs>). The other representations of lyre-players by this artist are in komos or bacchic scenes; one thinks especially of the splendid Dionysos on the cup in the Cabinet des Médailles, Hartwig, <title>Meisterschalen</title>, Pl. XXXIII. Our musician stands in a quieter pose, as if conscious of the judges who will take the style of his performance into account in making their decision. The <emph>ethos</emph> of the figure can best be appreciated by contrasting it with the excited citharode on an amphora by the Berlin painter in the Hearst collection, Beazley, <title>J.H.S.</title> xlii, 1922, Pl. II, fig. 1, p. 74, who is not performing in a contest, but practising <pb xml:id="i.21" n="21"/> under the eye of a trainer: he stands ungracefully with both knees bent; the violent movements of his body have set his draperies swinging.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 19. <title>ARV.</title> p. 255, Brygos Painter no. 151.

<p>About 480 B.C. By the Brygos painter. Particularly like the youth on this vase, the youth on a cup in the University of California, <rs key="UC 8.921" type="Vase">UC 8.921</rs>, by the Brygos painter (I, youth leaning on stick, playing with dog). (Beazley.)</p>

<p>The shape, one of three types of small jugs classed by Beazley as Oinochoe, form 8, has recently been discussed by him in <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 59. Though he calls it an oinochoe, 'evidently it might serve more than one purpose — as a dipper, a measure, a taster, or a portable drinking cup'. A second example in Boston (<rs key="Boston 97.606" type="Vase">Boston 97.606</rs>) with Eros flying, is drawn in <title>G.G.V.</title>, p. 147, no. 99.

<p>Greatest length, 0.251 m.; diameter of mouth, 0.122 m. Broken and repaired; the surface of the figures worn. The front edge of the maenad's leopard-skin and the line of her leg showing against it retouched. Parts of the animal's head painted white; in its nostrils and mouth, bright red laid over the white. The contours of the figures and of the bridle-straps done in relief lines.

<p>The rhyton is in the form of a bridled horse's head developing at the top into a cylindrical cup with flaring lip and furnished with a loop-handle. The animal's ears are laid against this cup. In front, between the ears, an excrescence, perhaps a conventionalized forelock, which serves a practical purpose: when the rhyton is laid down with the handle upward, it is supported in stable equilibrium on the animal's nose and the tip of the excrescence. The outer surface of the ears is left in the colour of the clay, their inner surface is painted white; their rims and tips are black. The eyelids are outlined in black; two long black lines extend downwards from the tear-duct of the left eye, but not of the right. The pupil is bordered by a reserved oval line on the black iris. The remainder of the eyeball is white; and a strip of white runs round the eye. The muzzle is white, with black dots on it to represent hairs. There are traces of red in the nostrils. The teeth are white, their interstices red. Remains of red also on the gums, the inner surface of the mouth, and the tongue. A strip of white runs up the forehead, widening towards the top; and there are remains of a similar strip on the bottom of the jaw. The bridle consists of a series of black straps holding a ring on either side of the mouth. The straps were first drawn in outline and decorated with dots, which are still faintly visible through the black varnish.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The upper portion of the rhyton, painted black within as well as without, has a tongue pattern at the rim and, near the bottom, a reserved ground line. The black strip below this has an ivy wreath painted on it in white. Each of the three fields formed by the handle and the horse's ears contains a single figure. On the left side a silen, open-mouthed and with arms waving, rushes to right in pursuit of a maenad. His bald head is wreathed; a leopard-skin, tied about his neck by the front paws, hangs down his back. Below, a drinking-horn which he has dropped in his excitement. On the right side the maenad runs from him with head turned back. She holds a thyrsus, with berries round its top, in her right hand, and with her extended left lifts one end of the leopard-skin tied about her shoulders. Her advanced left leg escapes from the folds of her Ionic chiton. The looped end of the girdle appears under the kolpos of the dress. She is wreathed and has fair hair hanging loose. On the front a second silen crouches on the ground to left, ready to spring upon the maenad. He wears high boots with flaps, and has a leopard-skin tied about his shoulder. In all three fields meaningless letters.</p>

<p>About 490-480 B.C. By the Brygos painter, to whom eight plastic rhyta of various forms are assigned by Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 181, nos. 77-84. Three of them are horse's heads, the others being in Orvieto<note anchored="true" n="i.22.1"><p>Of this there is now a photograph by Armoni.</p></note> and in Petrograd. The latter is figured in <title>Compte Rendu</title>, 1881, title-page and pp. 5, 49, 60, and described by Stephani, <title>Vasensammlung der kais. Eremitage</title>, no. 407. This and the example in Boston had already been attributed to 'Brygos' by Tonks, op. cit. The animal represented has been held to be a horse, a mule, or an ass. But the ears of our head are not long enough for an ass; cf. the true donkey's head on a black-figured kantharos in London, B.M. <title>Cat.</title> ii, p. 210, <rs key="London E 378" type="Vase">London E 378</rs>, illustrated in Buschor, <title>Münchner Jahrbuch</title>, l.c., p. 12, fig. 17, which is wrongly called a mule by Buschor and Walters. And of the remaining alternatives the first is to be preferred.</p>

<p>Beazley adds two other mule- or donkey-heads: (1) Noël des Vergers, Pl. II; evidently <pb xml:id="i.23" n="23"/> much restored, and the shape impossible, but bits of it seem right, and Brygan.

<p>Length, 0.086 m. From a small kylix, probably with undecorated exterior. Relief contours throughout. Brown used for the youth's whiskers, for his neck-muscle, and for some inner markings on his arm, though these are hard to distinguish from the lines of the preliminary sketch.</p>

<p>The upper part of a youthful komast, wearing a dotted himation with striped border, leaning forward on a knotted stick propped against his arm-pit, playing the flute.

<p>About 490-480 B.C. By the Brygos painter. Figures similarly leaning on sticks are common among his works; e.g. the trainer on side A of the skyphos, <ref target="no.18" n="U">no. 18</ref>, Pl.

<p>Height, 0.074 m.; diameter, 0.206 m. Put together from numerous pieces with only slight damage to the picture. The exterior undecorated. Relief contours throughout. Red used for the youth's fillet, the dog's collar, and the inscription; thinned paint for the youth's whiskers and for some almost indistinguishable inner markings on his abdomen and arms.</p>

<p>Within a border of interlocking maeander, in threes interrupted by 'Dourian' cross squares, an athlete stands with left leg advanced, bending forward. He holds a strigil in his right hand, which is swung out to the rear, and extends his right arm to the front. Behind him, part of a stool with a mantle lying on it. Before him, a small, short-haired dog looking up at its master. A pair of crossed rods stuck obliquely into the ground <pb xml:id="i.25" n="25"/> suggests the palaestra. In the field in small red letters the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The end of the athlete's fillet, hardly visible in the photograph, stands up in front like that of the youthful trainer on the Brygan skyphos <ref target="no.18" n="U">no. 18</ref>, Pl. VII (<rs key="Boston 10.176" type="Vase">Boston 10.176</rs>). The dog has a red string round its neck.</p>

<p>The motive is convincingly interpreted by Beazley as follows: The athlete, who has been cleaning his strigil, is dropping the scrapings of oil and dust from his left hand, as suggested by the positions of the fingers; and these scrapings attract the dog. The same motive appears more clearly on the cup in Florence, Hartwig, <title>Meisterschalen</title>, Pl. LXII. 3, and somewhat differently on the grave relief of about 460 B.C. from Delphi, figured by Bulle, <title>Der schöne Mensch</title> 2, Pl. 265. Here an athlete stands in front view with arms held out to the side, scraping his left forearm with a strigil held in his right hand. Beside him, a small boy; between them the lifted head of a dog much interested in the scrapings. On a cup in Brussels, <title>Corpus</title> Cinquantenaire III. 1 <emph>c</emph>, Pl. 4, 4 (by the Brygos painter according to Beazley, <title>Att.

The end of a cushion, decorated with small circles in brown, hangs over the back of the seat.

<p>About 480 B.C. Called by Beazley a good, characteristic work of the painter of the Paris Gigantomachy, who 'reduced the fabrication of Brygan pieces to a mechanical process'. Two other lekythoi of his are decorated with female figures standing in the same attitude, but winged, and holding different things in their hands: <rs key="Berlin 2211" type="Vase">Berlin 2211</rs> (Millingen, <title>Ancient Unedited Monuments</title>, i, Pl. 29), and a vase with Nike, from Selinus, in Palermo.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 30. <title>ARV.</title> p. 278, Painter of the Paris Gigantomachy, no. 97.</p></note></p>

Restored, on the interior, the lower legs and feet of the warrior, the ends of the spear, and of the leg of the couch, and the adjoining bit of maeander (omitted in the photograph on the plate); on the exterior, the top of the shield at the left end of side A.

<p>From Orvieto. Formerly in the Bourguignon collection. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 94. Hoppin, i, p. 456, no. 7. Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 187, no. 10. A drawing of the shape in Caskey, <title>G.G.V.</title>, p. 192, no. 147.</p>

<p>Interior. A young warrior standing in a twisted pose, his feet to right, his body in front view, his head looking back. He wears a short chiton and a mantle decorated with a black border and rows of dots. He is armed with a spear, a large round shield, and greaves. A fillet is tied about his head. His helmet is on a stool beside him. An elaborately ornamented cloth hangs from the shield, which has as device a centaur brandishing a tree.</p>

<p>Exterior. A. Four youths arming, grouped in two pairs. The scene is indoors, as appears from the remains of a column on a square base at the right end of the picture and from two helmets hung up on the wall. The youth at the left stands in profile to right, with his body thrown back somewhat to balance the shield which he is taking down from the wall. Its device is a scorpion. He wears a short chiton, cuirass, and greaves, and has a fillet tied about his head. Behind him a helmet hangs on the wall, and a shield, seen in side view, leans against the handle of the vase. Its device is an irregular blot between two circles with dotted centres. The second youth, an archer, stoops to string his bow. He wears a skin cap with long flaps, and Thracian boots, but is otherwise nude. His quiver hangs at his side. Behind him a spear leans against the wall, and beyond this a helmet is hung on a peg. Of the second pair the figure on the left, so far as he is <pb xml:id="i.27" n="27"/> preserved, is almost a duplicate of the youth with the shield, save that he does not wear a fillet. Beyond him are the greaved legs of a warrior advancing to the left. It can be seen that he wore a mantle. His right hand held a spear, the lower end of which appears between his legs. His left hand evidently rested on the top of the shield before him. Its device is a horse or a centaur.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>B. Four warriors arming, out of doors, as is shown by the tree at the right end. The figure at the left stands in an easy pose, his left hand resting on the top of his shield (device, a tripod), his advanced right hand holding his spear. He wears chiton, chlamys, and greaves. Next to him are the legs of a second warrior standing with his weight on his frontal right leg, his left crossed behind it. The lower end of his lance appears behind a shield lying on the ground beside him. The scanty remains of the third figure show that he was drawing his sword from its scabbard. In front of the shield on the ground are two toes of his right foot, which was seen in profile. The fourth figure is a youth stooping to pick up his helmet from the ground (the end of its long plume appears in front of his advanced foot). His left hand holds his spear and his shield, which covers the greater part of his body. The shield-device is a snake. His head is bound with a fillet, and he wears greaves, but not a cuirass. The texture of the upper part of his chiton is rendered by wavy brown lines.</p>

<p>Some details of the armour call for comment. The helmet on the couch and one of those on the exterior have on the part above the forehead an ornament consisting of black dots on a ground of thinned paint, evidently imitating curls of hair. That on actual helmets this ornament was worked in relief and gilded appears clearly from the numerous representations in vase painting.<note anchored="true" n="i.27.1"><p>Cf. Hauser, <title>Jahreshefte</title>, ix, 1906, p. 96. He cites examples on works of Douris, e.g. the cup in Vienna, F.R., Pl. 54 (<rs key="Vienna 3695" type="Vase">Vienna 3695</rs>, and the kantharos in Brussels, F.R., Pl. 74 (<rs key="Brussels A 718" type="Vase">Brussels A 718</rs>), and on the Troilos cup in Perugia signed by Euphronios, Hartwig, Pls. 58, 59, 1. He finds it on none of the vases of 'Hieron', and among Brygan works only once, on the unsigned Gigantomachy cup in Berlin, F.R., Pl. 160 (<rs key="Berlin F 2293" type="Vase">Berlin F 2293</rs>). But it is recognizable in the helmet of Neoptolemos on the Ilioupersis cup in the Louvre signed by Brygos, F.R., Pl. 25 (<rs key="Louvre G 152" type="Vase">Louvre G 152</rs>); and it appears also on the Brygan skyphos in Vienna, F.R., Pl. 84 (<rs key="Vienna inv. 3710" type="Vase">Vienna inv. 3710</rs>), and on the Brygan kylix in Corneto, <title>Mon. d. Inst.</title> xi, Pl. 33. Both helmets on the Berlin Foundry cup, F.R., Pl. 135 (<rs key="Berlin F 2294" type="Vase">Berlin F 2294</rs>), have the ornament. So has the helmet of Memnon on the Tyskiewicz krater in Boston, Froehner, <title>Coll. Tysk.</title>, Pl. 17 (<rs key="Boston 97.368" type="Vase">Boston 97.368</rs>).</p></note> The cloth hanging from the shield in the interior picture occurs frequently on red-figured vases from the archaic to the Polygnotan period.<note anchored="true" n="i.27.2"><p>e.g. on two cups by the Paris Gigantomachy painter, Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 189, nos. 2 and 4.</p></note> The drawing of the shields is similar to that in Brygan works. The contour is an incised circle made with compasses and covered with a relief line. Within this are one or two circles merely incised. The convexity of the central part of the shield is suggested by hatching in thinned paint. Similar hatching is used on the shields seen in profile, which are drawn in faulty perspective so as to show part of the interior. Most of the shield devices are common. The nondescript blot between two dotted circles is exactly duplicated on a shield on the Munich kylix; F.R. ii, p. 135, fig. 37, and, less exactly, on the Harvard kylix by the Foundry painter, Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 187, no. 8 (<rs key="Harvard 1927.149" type="Vase">Harvard 1927.149</rs>). Three of the youths have strips of cloth tied about their ankles to keep the greaves from chafing them, a detail clearly shown on the interior of the Brygan cup with arming scenes in the Vatican, Gerhard, <title>A.V.</title>, Pl. 270.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>This is the largest and best of three cups with arming scenes which Beazley has <pb xml:id="i.28" n="28"/> attributed convincingly to the painter of the Berlin Foundry kylix, F.R., Pl. 135 (<rs key="Berlin F 2294" type="Vase">Berlin F 2294</rs>). The others, each with only six figures on the outside, are in Brussels, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 187, no. 9, <title>Corpus</title>, Cinquantenaire, III. 1 <emph>c</emph>, Pl. 3, 1 a-d, and at Harvard University, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 187, no. 8 (<rs key="Harvard 1927.149" type="Vase">Harvard 1927.149</rs>). A replica of the youth holding out his shield appears on the former. On our cup the warrior on the interior, though carefully drawn, is less life-like than his attractively posed comrades outside. The influence of the Brygos painter is apparent when one compares the master's rendering of the same subject on the Vatican cup, Gerhard, <title>A.V.</title>, Pl. 270. On both vases the warriors are intent on what they are doing, in strong contrast to the talkative youths on the arming cup in Vienna signed by Douris, F.R., Pl. 53 (<rs key="Vienna 3694" type="Vase">Vienna 3694</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 31. <title>ARV.</title> p. 264, Foundry Painter no. 15.</p></note></p>

<p>Diameter, 0.298 m., height, 0.117 m. Put together from many pieces, with a few small lacunae. Extensively repaired in antiquity with clamps, for which the holes remain. No restorations.

<p>Interior. A bearded man, reclining on a couch, twirls a kylix about the forefinger of his outstretched right hand in the game of kottabos. His left hand holds a large skyphos, drawn in outline. He rests against a large cushion, probably an inflated wineskin (see below). A mantle covers the lower part of his body and his right leg, which is bent at the knee with the foot planted on the couch. His left leg is drawn up and shown in front view. Leaning against him is a youth playing the flute. His legs are covered by a mantle, and it is not clear how they were supported. Probably they were folded back with the feet tucked under him, since there are no traces of a stool like that under the corresponding figure on side B. Both man and youth are wreathed. A flute-case hangs in the field. In front of the couch is a low, three-legged table from which three wreaths depend.

<p>Exterior. A. A bearded man and a youth reclining on couches, with two boys as cup-bearers. The man at the left looks round at his companion, and calls out to him as he twirls a kylix with his right hand. A second kylix, painted black, is in his left hand. His hair is bound with a headband, drawn in outline, and therefore perhaps of linen, and a wreath in red. The youth at the right is apparently calling to the cup-bearer to fill the kylix which he holds up with his right hand. His left holds a black skyphos. His wreath and his long fillet are done in red paint much diluted, or in thinned glaze. Between the couches the cup-bearer, with oinochoe in hand, moves towards the youth, but looks back at the man. At the extreme left the second boy stands in a frontal pose, looking to left. He holds an oinochoe and a strainer. His straight, brown hair, confined by a narrow red fillet, falls to his shoulder. Two baskets are hung up on the wall. Below the man's couch, a skyphos; in front of the other couch a table with three wreaths on it. In the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>B. Three figures disposed on two couches and a stool placed close together. At the <pb xml:id="i.29" n="29"/> right, a bearded man twirling a kylix with his right hand, and holding a black kylix in his left. His left leg is exposed and drawn in front view like that of the man in the interior. His head, shown in front view, is wreathed, and bound with a cloth, drawn in outline, and tied so that its long ends hang at either side.<note anchored="true" n="i.29.1"><p>Similar headbands, with ends hanging at the sides, are worn by two symposiasts, one shown in front view, the other in profile, on a cup fragment in Tübingen, Watzinger, <title>Griechische Vasen in Tübingen</title>, <rs key="Tbingen E 26" type="Vase">Tübingen E 26</rs>, Pl. 20.</p></note> His friend, on the second couch, turns round towards him and extends both hands, one holding a cup. He wears a similar headband, with its ends hanging behind, and wreath. At the left a youth seated on a stool, but leaning back against the central figure, plays the flute. He wears a wreath, but no fillet. Two baskets hang above. A table, with wreaths laid on it, stands under each couch. Behind the older man's couch a staff is standing against the wall. In the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O *P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. Beazley remarks that the cushion of the man at the right on side B is certainly a wine-skin, and the others probably. Wine-skins are used as cushions on the Cambridge cup mentioned below, on the Boston symposium cup by the Panaitios painter <rs key="Boston 01.8018" type="Vase">Boston 01.8018</rs>, Hartwig, <title>Meisterschalen</title>, Pl. XIV, 2, Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 166, no. 12; and on the erotic cup in Corneto, F.R. iii, p. 252, above.

<p>These paintings were described by Robinson in the <title>Annual Report</title> as 'in the style of Brygos', and definitely attributed to him by Tonks. Their true relationship to the Brygos painter was first made clear by Beazley, who assigns both this cup and its pendant, the symposium cup in Cambridge,<note anchored="true" n="i.29.2"><p>Published by Bicknell, <title>J.H.S.</title> xli, 1921, p. 223, Pls. 15, 16, fig. 2.</p></note> to the Foundry painter, an artist who shows 'a not always ineffective coarsening of the Brygan style'. In <title>Vases in America</title>, p. 93, figs. 61, 62, Beazley makes a significant comparison between the standing cup-bearer on our vase and a similar figure on the Brygan symposium cup in London, Hartwig, Pl. 34: 'How admirable the drawing in both! only, the Brygan boy is made like us of flesh and air: the other is a most captivating marionette.'<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 32. <title>ARV.</title> p. 264, Foundry Painter no. 11.</p></note></p>

<p>Diameter, 0.238 m. Incomplete; repaired with clamps in antiquity; the handles and the foot missing. Relief contour lines throughout; red used for the wreaths, the girdles of two of the maenads, the meaningless inscriptions in the field, brown for the inner markings on the bodies and for some of the drapery folds. It is noteworthy that the neck-muscle is indicated on all three maenads (inadvertently omitted on the drawings).</p>

<p>From Cervetri. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1913, p. 90. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 94. Hoppin, i, p. 456, no. 8. Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 187, no. 1.</p>

<p>Interior: a maenad moving to right with her right leg advanced, her body in front view, her head turned back and inclined. Her right hand holds a thyrsus, her left a spotted snake. Her head is wreathed with ivy. She wears an Ionic chiton with overfold like that of the better-preserved figure on side A. A leopard-skin is tied about her neck and hangs down her back.</p>

<p>On each side of the exterior, a maenad, attacked by two silens, defends herself with her thyrsus and her snake. On B she thrusts out her snake at the right-hand silen, and is ready to poke him with her thyrsus. On A she wheels round to the left-hand silen, prepares to strike at him with the butt of her thyrsus, and thrusts out her snake towards him. The silen at the left on B wears a leopard-skin, and his body seems to have been bent far forward, if the remains above the maenad's right elbow are correctly explained as the fingers of his left hand.<note anchored="true" n="i.29.3"><p>These <emph>five</emph> fingers, none of which resembles a thumb, are in even more wooden style than those of a komast on the Cambridge cup by the Foundry Painter: <title>J.H.S.</title> xli, 1921, Pl.

In the field at right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*L*O*S*P</foreign>.</p>

<p>Exterior, A. Three athletes exercising under the direction of a trainer. First, a youth with right hand raised and left holding a javelin, in animated conversation with a second youth, who is moving to right with body thrown back and shoulders in front view, looking back at the javelin which he poises in his right hand, with two fingers inserted in the throwing-strap, while he steadies the tip with his left hand. Then a jumper, to right, swinging a pair of leaden halteres to the front. Facing him the bearded trainer, wrapped in an himation, holding a forked stick in his right hand. Between these two, a discus decorated with a swastika hanging in a bag on the wall, and two javelins placed obliquely. Single javelins in the field between the first and second and the second and third youths. All four javelins have <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)gku/lai</foreign> tied to them. Under the handle, behind the trainer, a discus, also decorated with a swastika.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>B. Two athletes engaged in a contest under the eyes of a youthful trainer. The one at the left is apparently falling backward as a result of a blow delivered by his opponent. He holds up his left arm to guard his head. Both fists are clenched. His adversary <pb xml:id="i.31" n="31"/> advances to deliver a second blow with his left fist, which is swung out to the rear, while his right arm guards his head. The attitudes do not suggest a wrestling bout. Nor can the contest be a boxing-match, since the fingers of the youths are not bound with thongs (<foreign xml:lang="greek">mei/lixai</foreign>). It is probably the pankration, one feature of which was hitting with the bare hands. The trainer, wearing himation and soft shoes (<foreign xml:lang="greek">persikai/</foreign>), stands at the left, leaning on a knotted stick, and holding a forked wand in his right hand. At the right, a goal-post, and a pair of javelins, crossed. For the subject and attitudes Beazley compares the cup by the painter of the Paris Gigantomachy in Brussels, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 190, no. 10; <title>Corpus</title>, Cinquantenaire, III. 1 <emph>c</emph>, Pl. 3, 2, which has almost exactly the same composition, but facing the other way.</p>

<p>Diameter, 0.33 m.; height, 0.121 m. A large, well-made kylix, incomplete and badly damaged. The handles missing; the surface mostly eaten away except where protected by the black glaze. The lines of the pictures, including those from which the black has worn off, rise above the adjoining surface. Relief contours throughout, apparently. Red paint used in the interior for the straps of the two petasoi, for the cords of Phanas' gaiters, for his sword-belt; on the exterior for the shoes of the archer at the left, for the dots on his trousers, for the leaves of the tree; also for the inscriptions within and without. The two archers are in the black-figured technique, with details incised. The quiver of the left-hand archer, the strap and cords on the interior of Hector's shield, and a line on his left thigh are in brown.</p>

<p>After having been in the possession of the dealer Depoletti in Rome, the kylix disappeared, and was finally bought in London. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1898, p. 68, no. 42.

<p>The fairly accurate drawings reproduced by Pollak have made plain the unreliability of the earlier publication of the exterior by Gerhard. But, in view of the interesting <pb xml:id="i.32" n="32"/> subjects, it has seemed worth while to give on Plate XIV full-size photographs of the kylix in its present state.</p>

<p>Interior: A youth, Phanas, seated on a rock in profile to right, with head bowed, right hand resting on knee, left hand raised and holding two spears. His bearded companion, Empedion, stands looking down at him. He also holds a pair of spears in his right hand; his left hand, covered by his cloak, rests on his hip. His sword hangs at his side, while that of Phanas with a red cross-belt is suspended in the field. Both are garbed in petasos, chlamys, and boots. The hat of Phanas hangs behind his neck, that of Empedion is held in place on the top of his head by a red cord. Empedion's chlamys is fastened in front by a round brooch. The boots of Phanas reach to the calf of his leg, and their upper parts are bound with cords, the ends of which, painted red, project in front of his ankles. Empedion evidently had similar boots, for a bit of cord is visible in front of his leg just above the break.<note anchored="true" n="i.32.1"><p>The leg coverings resemble those worn above his sandals by Zeus on side B of the Brygan kantharos, <ref target="no.17" n="U">no. 17</ref>, Pl.

<p>Exterior: The walls of Troy, represented by three gates surmounted by a line of battlements running continuously round the cup just below the rim.</p>

<p>On side A Hector rushes to left, pursued by Achilles. To right and left of this group, an open gate with an archer standing on guard in it. Hector, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*H*E*K]*T*O*R</foreign>, is bearded, and wears a short chiton, a bronze cuirass with anatomical markings drawn on it, an Attic crested helmet with cheek-pieces raised, and greaves. He turns his head as he runs, and aims his spear at Achilles, holding out his shield on his left arm. His face is in three-quarter view with the mouth wide open. Achilles, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*X*I*L*L*E*U[*S]</foreign>, similarly equipped (so far as can be seen), with the addition of a sword hanging at his left side, advances his shield and holds his spear in his right hand. A bit of his profile is preserved, showing that he was bearded. It is noteworthy that his right foot is in perspective with the sole visible. Both shields are drawn in perspective, that of Achilles having a black boar as a device. In the spaces of the battlements above the shields, the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*I]*L[*I]*O*N</foreign>. The gate-posts are reserved. Against their inner faces the ends of the door-valves are shown in black. Each valve has three cross-pieces (the topmost missing) fastened upon it with large nails, two rows of nails for each cross-piece. The cross-pieces are in outline, the nail-heads in black. Against the reserved ground of each gateway, an archer in the black-figured technique. The one guarding the left-hand gate stands in front view, holding his bow in his left hand. He wears a long-sleeved tunic, tight-fitting trousers, and red shoes; his quiver hangs in front of his body. The folds of the chiton, the seam and hem of the sleeve, and a pattern of squares on the trousers are rendered by finely incised lines. Each square on the trousers has a red dot in its centre. The less well preserved figure in the right-hand doorway also holds his bow in his left hand, and is similarly attired, but without red shoes. The incised pattern on his sleeves and trousers is also different: circles to left of the seam, rows of wavy lines to right.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The centre of side B is occupied by a gate with a wider opening and background painted black. The details of the door-valves are like those on A, but with the colours reversed. On the ground in the centre of the opening, an object shaped like the echinus of a Doric capital upside down. This, as Pollak suggests, is a stone against which the <pb xml:id="i.33" n="33"/> door valves were set when closed. Similar door-stones, drawn in outline, appear less clearly in the gates on side A. In the opening, Priam, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*R*I[*A]*M[*O*S]</foreign>, in Ionic chiton, himation, and black shoes, moves cautiously to right, holding a sceptre in his extended left hand, and grasping the post behind him with his right. He is evidently conceived as being inside the gate, on the look-out for Hector. Behind him, well within the walls, Hekabe, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*H*E*K*A]*B*E</foreign>, in chiton decorated with small circles, and himation, follows him with hands raised in excitement. At the right of the gate, and evidently outside the wall, Athena, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*A]*Q*E*N*A[*I*A]</foreign>, advances to right, with spear in her right hand, shield on her extended left arm. Only her right shoulder, the lower edge of the shield, a bit of drapery below it, her right foot, and the butt of the spear are preserved. Before her, a tree, suggesting that she is waiting in ambush to attack Hector. The scene evidently represents the pursuit of Hector by Achilles as described in the twenty-second book of the Iliad.</p>

<p>The cup is peculiar, not only because it has a cover, but also because of the device for filling it. The stem is hollow and the tube thus formed continues upwards inside nearly to the rim. If the cup was held obliquely upside down, it could be filled almost completely through this tube, and, once filled, it could be emptied only through the mouthpiece. Another cup in the Museum, with black-figured decoration on the cover, has a similar device with an additional protection against spilling: the inner as well as the outer edge of the mouthpiece is walled, and there is only a small slit below where the walls meet.<note anchored="true" n="i.33.1"><p><rs key="Boston 95.16" type="Vase">Boston 95.16</rs>, <title>Collection van Branteghem</title>, no. 21, Pl. 2.</p></note> See <ref n="U">figure 28</ref>.

<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The picture on the cover is executed in colours on a white ground bordered by a large red-figured laurel wreath. Apollo, wreathed with laurel, stands in front view before a <pb xml:id="i.34" n="34"/> girl seated on a rock. His arms are enveloped in the folds of a purple-red mantle which he has drawn apart so that it hangs behind him revealing his slender, long-legged form. The girl, clothed in a light brown Doric peplos fastened on the shoulder by a long pin, sits with her chin on her right hand and holds a lyre with her left. They are gazing into each other's eyes. The contours and the hair of both figures, the inner markings of Apollo's body, the eight strings of the lyre and the details of its tortoise-shell body, the irregular ground and the outline of the rock, the maeander band marking the exergue, and the circle enclosing the picture are done in golden brown glaze of varying tones. Dark purple is used for the folds of Apollo's mantle, and for the spots on the tortoise-shell. The folds of the girl's peplos are dark brown. Certain details were added in relief and gilded: Apollo's wreath, the pin on the girl's dress, her earring and spiral bracelet, the arms of the lyre, the knob at the end of its cross-bar, and four small disks placed on the maeander band below the picture. Traces of gold still remain on the laurel wreath, the earring, the left arm of the lyre, and one of the disks.</p>

<p>The subject is evidently Apollo revealing himself to a Muse on Mt. Helikon. Compare the Muse with lyre seated on a rock inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*L*I*K*O*N</foreign> on the white lekythos by the Achilles painter, F.R. iii, p. 303, fig. 145. In spirit as well as in composition the picture calls to mind sculptured metopes of the Polygnotan period: Hera unveiling herself before Zeus on Mt. Ida (temple of Hera, Selinus); Athena perched on a rock receiving the Stymphalian birds from Herakles (temple of Zeus at Olympia); a woman seated on a rock and a standing woman (north metope 32 of the Parthenon; Aphrodite and Athena?).</p>

<p>On the exterior of the kylix the space on each side between the elaborate handle palmettes is occupied by the figure of a woman, in Ionic chiton and himation, moving to right with head turned back, and holding tendrils in both hands.</p>

<p>Height, including the lid and its knob, 0.176 m.; diameter 0.146 m. Unbroken; the rims of the pyxis and the lid slightly chipped. The surface of the picture has been cleaned with acid, and parts of it have flaked off, especially in the region of the herdsman and the cow. Our illustration, made up of seven photographs joined together, shows the picture slightly reduced. The height of the white ground is 0.067 m., if its curve is flattened out. One of the palmettes of the ornament to the right of the third Muse has been lost in the composite photograph, but is shown in the view of the complete pyxis. The red of the mantles has come out too dark in the photographs. Partial use of relief lines for contours, as well as for eyes and ears, and for details of the hair, the lyres, the cross-legged stool, the palmettes in the field. Other outlines in black glaze without relief, sometimes turning to brown. The folds of the women's chitons, the strings of the lyres, the inner markings on the herdsman and the cow are in light-brown glaze. Five of the mantles, the borders of the sixth, the herdsman's chiton, the fillet held by the first Muse and her necklace, the straps of the lyres held by the second and sixth Muses are in purplish red. Numerous details added in relief and originally gilded, as follows: <emph>first Muse</emph>, earring and pendant of necklace; <emph>second</emph>, headband, earring, bracelets; <emph>fifth</emph>, headband with beads on it, earring, bracelets; <emph>sixth</emph>, headband with two beads above, earring, bead of necklace, apple in right hand, four bosses on lyre.</p>

<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The pyxis is of Beazley's form A, popular in the second half of the fifth century.<note anchored="true" n="i.35.1"><p>Numerous examples are illustrated in <title>Metr. Mus. Shapes</title>, and in Curtius, <title>Pentheus</title>. Beazley, in <title>V.A.</title>, p. 128, lists ours as one of seven white pyxides, all of about the same date, of which the vase in New York, with the Judgement of Paris, is the finest.</p></note> The top of the lid is decorated in red-figure, with a tongue pattern round the knob, then a band of carefully drawn palmettes, then, next the rim, interlocking maeanders interrupted by squares with crosses in them. Its side has vertical black stripes. The hollow base has three openings cut into it, perhaps designed to facilitate handling.<note anchored="true" n="i.35.2"><p>This explanation, given in <title>Metr. Mus. Shapes</title>, is preferable to that of Curtius, l.c., p. 7, who supposes that the openings were needed because the pyxides were containers of perfume, and were placed in warm water to soften the contents.</p></note></p>

<p>At the left end of the picture a cowherd stands in front view, leaning his right hand on a black, knotted club, his left arm bent with the hand to the front. He wears a red chiton, high black boots, and a cloak, probably of dappled fawn-skin. At his left, a suggestion of mountainous landscape. At his right, a cow in profile to right, stretching out her head so that her muzzle almost touches the shoulder of the woman who stands in front view with her head turned to right, holding a doubled red fillet in her right hand. These three figures form a group; and the woman is distinguished from her five sisters in that she wears a sakkos, and a white, dotted mantle, with red border, instead of a red mantle. Between the cow and the woman, a tree-trunk with a leafy branch issuing from it; and above the cow's back the foliage of the upper part of the tree. Next, a group of three women, more widely spaced. The first stands in profile to right, playing a cithara, which she holds with the help of a strap passed over her right wrist. A fringed end of the strap hangs down from the cithara. This has a sounding-box rounded at the bottom, and decorated with bosses in relief. The central figure of the group is seated to left on a folding campstool, <foreign xml:lang="greek">di/fros o)kladi/as</foreign>, with crossed deer's legs. She holds a tortoise-shell lyre with her left hand and a plectrum in her right. Her head is in three-quarter view looking towards the woman at her right, who stands facing her, holding a phiale in her extended right hand, and a syrinx in her left. In the field to the right of the seated figure, a tendril with three spirals issuing from the ground; to the left a similar tendril without stem. These conventionalized plants are in strong contrast to the naturalistic rendering of the tree. At the right end of the picture, a group of two women: the first seated on a stool, playing the flute, the other standing before her, holding an apple in her outstretched right hand and in her left a cithara like that played by the second Muse, but seen from behind. It has four bosses; and its strap, partly obliterated, hangs from the lower arm. All six women wear Ionic chitons; all, except the first, red mantles variously draped. That of the last figure is drawn up over the back of the head.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>Beazley adds the following note on the subject and on the style:</p>

<p>The pyxis is a woman's accessory, and pyxides are nearly always decorated with feminine subjects: weddings and the preparations for them, washing and dressing, work and pastime in the home. If a male comes in, he is one to many women, and the scene remains largely feminine. It is Peleus and Thetis and her sisters, Boreas and Oreithyia and her sisters, Poseidon and Amymone and her sisters, Odysseus and Nausicaa and her maids of honour. If Paris appears, it is to judge the three goddesses; if Perseus appears, it is to rob the three Graiai or quell the three Gorgons; if Pentheus appears, it is to be torn by many maenads. The only battles are one or two Amazonomachies. Apollo appears, but with several Muses. Zeus appears once — with his wife and two other goddesses.<note anchored="true" n="i.35.3"><p><rs key="Berlin inv. 3308" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 3308</rs>, signed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Agaqwn epoihsen</foreign>, about 440. (<title>Arch. Anz.</title> 1895, p. 38.)</p></note> On our vase also there are six female figures and but one male. The females are not mortals: with cithara, lyre, syrinx, among rocks and wild plants, they can only be the Muses. The Muses had often been depicted (already on the chest of Cypselus, and on the François vase<note anchored="true" n="i.35.4"><p>See von Massow, in <title>Ath. Mitt.</title> xli, 1926, pp. 66-8.</p></note>); but in the early classical period the representations become more <pb xml:id="i.36" n="36"/> numerous and more subtle. A red-figured pyxis, contemporary with ours, in Athens, shows the Muses sitting and standing, with their lord Apollo seated in their midst.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.1"><p><rs key="Athens 1241" type="Vase">Athens 1241</rs> (Collignon and Couve, Pl. 47, no. 1553).</p></note></p>

<p>But the male figure on our vase does not seem to be Apollo, for he wears a short chiton, a skin, boots, rests his hand on a clubby stick like a blackthorn, and has a cow at his side. He is a herdsman, and has much in common with the cowherd Paris on the contemporary white pyxis in New York.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.2"><p><rs key="New York 07.286.36" type="Vase">New York 07.286.36</rs> (<title>A.J.A.</title> xix, 1915, Pls. 29-30).</p></note> Now Apollo was a herdsman once: for a year, as a punishment, he kept the cattle of Admetus. Can this be Apollo in Thessaly?</p>

<p>The demeanour of the Muses is against it. Even if the master is disguised, and more or less in disgrace, they should be like angels ministering to him. They are not: he looks at them,<note anchored="true" n="i.36.3"><p>The head is lost, but the attitude of the left foot shows that the head was turned to the left shoulder.</p></note> but they take no notice of him.</p>

<p>If not Apollo, who is he? He cannot be just a herdsman, he must be a particular herdsman, by the laws of Greek art, and especially Greek art of this still early time. And on a cylindrical vase with its unbroken field, and a vase painted with care, he cannot be a picture by himself, he must be a herdsman connected with the Muses. What if he were Daphnis? Daphnis was the herdsman par excellence, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( bouko/los</foreign>, and his cows were famous, they were sisters to the cows of Helios. And the poet calls him 'the dear to the Muses, the not undear to the nymphs':</p>

<p><foreign xml:lang="greek">to\n *Moi/sais fi/lon a)/ndra, to\n ou) *Nu/mfaisin a)pexqh=</foreign>.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.4"><p>Theocritus, i, 141.</p></note></p>

<p>The story of Daphnis may have been known in Athens at this time, for Aelian seems to imply that Stesichorus sang the blinding of Daphnis.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.5"><p><title>Varia Historia</title>, 10, 18.</p></note> But whether to Stesichorus, as to later Greeks, Daphnis was the inventor of bucolic poetry, is not clear. Moreover, the Attic poets never mention Daphnis (who could have fitted into many a tragic chorus); and there are no certain representations of him until Hellenistic times. Hauser, indeed, hinted that the goatherd-boy pursued by Pan on a vase of our period, the Pan painter's masterpiece in Boston,<note anchored="true" n="i.36.6"><p><rs key="Boston 10.185" type="Vase">Boston 10.185</rs>; F.R., Pl. 115.</p></note> might possibly be Daphnis; but prudently did not insist.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.7"><p>Ibid., ii, p. 294.</p></note></p>

<p>So let Daphnis pass down the river. There is another name which I make bold to pronounce: Hesiod. In the sublime overture to the Theogony, the poet tells how the Muses taught him song as he was tending his sheep on Helicon.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.8"><p><bibl n="Hes. Th. 22-3">Hes. Th. 22-3</bibl>.</p></note> Alas, on our vase the herdsman's charge is a cow, not a sheep. But Hesiod says a great deal about cattle, and if we can allow the painter this one inaccuracy, the subject may be Hesiod's first sight of the Muses, in their home, near his, on Helicon. Helicon is represented, and even named, in the picture of two Muses on a white lekythos.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.9"><p>F.R. iii, p. 303.</p></note> Sappho and Alcaeus, Solon and Anacreon, and other poets and musicians of less enduring fame, are all represented on Attic vases: there is no reason why Hesiod should not have been represented; and if a mortal was to be shown with the Muses, it might fitly be the great poet, not who first invoked them, but who first, and in magnificent language, related his vision of them — the earliest direct account of a personal experience in all Greek literature.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) Pp. 35-36 (with <ref target="ii.101" n="U">ii p. 101 (Addenda to Part I)</ref>): the youth might also be Archilochus, as Kondoleon has shown by comparison with the new Archilochus inscription discovered in Paros: see Kondoleon in <title>Eph</title>. 1952 pp. 57-68, Peek in <title>Philologus</title> 99 pp. 23-26, Kondoleon in <title>Philologus</title> 100 pp. 36-39. The same subject as on the pyxis may perhaps be represented on a later vase, a bell-krater by the Pothos Painter in the collection of the Banco di Sicilia, Palermo (Fondazione Ignazio Mormino): see <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1686 no. 23 bis; the youth there, however, does not wear a pelt.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The Boston pyxis must have been painted about 460 or 450: it naturally brings to mind the white-ground work of the Sotades painter and such white pyxides as that with the Judgement of Paris in New York,<note anchored="true" n="i.36.10"><p>See above.</p></note> that with a wedding in the British Museum,<note anchored="true" n="i.36.11"><p>Murray, <title>White Athenian Vases</title>, Pl. 20.</p></note> or the maenad pyxis which was in the market some years ago.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.12"><p><title>Sale Cat. Sotheby, Dec. 7, 1920</title>, Pl. 1.</p></note> But the style is quieter than there, and has more of the Pistoxenos painter in it than of Sotadean. The vases which come nearest it are three stemless cups in the same technique. The first is the masterpiece in the Louvre with the seated Muse tuning her lyre.<note anchored="true" n="i.36.13"><p><title>Mon. Piot</title>, ii, Pl. 5 (Pottier): Langlotz, <title>Gr. Vasenbilder</title>, Pl. 36. On the technique of this and its companion, misunderstood in the publication, see Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 13, note 2. On the interpretation, Studniczka in <title>Jahrbuch</title> 38-9, p. 87: the Muse is not playing but tuning.</p></note> The workmanship is much more delicate and beautiful than in our pyxis, and the single figure is set more freely in space, but the drawing is very like: note especially the shape of the head, rather wide from back to front, the receding upper lip, the receding chin, the interest in furniture, and above all the <pb xml:id="i.37" n="37"/> treatment of the drapery — the folds of the chiton, both at the waist and above, and on the legs, an anticipation of Parthenonian soft raiment.<note anchored="true" n="i.37.1"><p>Metope North 32 (Smith, <title>Parthenon</title>, Pl. 25, 1); Aphrodite of Daphni.</p></note> The second vase is also in the Louvre, the companion-piece to the other, and by the same hand:<note anchored="true" n="i.37.2"><p><title>Mon. Piot</title>, ii, Pl. 6 (Pottier). The mouth is not open as Pottier (p. 40) and Philippart after him (<title>Mon. Piot</title>, p. 18) suppose. What they take for the space between the lips is the lower lip. In the Boston pyxis the line representing the commissure of the lips has lost most of its black, but is still visible in the reproduction.</p></note> the face of the standing Muse, in three-quarter view, may be compared with the similar face on our pyxis. The third vase, in Berlin, is of just the same shape as the pair in Paris, but far inferior in drawing: it represents a woman bending at an altar. Her sleeve, falling loose from her extended arm, resembles the sleeve of the Muse near the cow, and her head and hair recall our Muses. All three cups may be by the same painter as the Boston pyxis: the Paris cups finer, the Berlin less fine.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 37. <title>ARV.</title> p. 458, Hesiod Painter no. 1.

<p>Height, without lid, 0.327 m.; width, including handles, 0.374 m.; diameter of body, 0.281 m. Intact, including the lid. The interior painted black. The edges of the foot and of the lid reserved. Very sparing use of relief contours, as follows: A, <emph>left-hand figure</emph>, right arm, top of right foot; <emph>central figure</emph>, back of neck, lower line of right arm, fingers, kantharos, thyrsus; <emph>right-hand figure</emph>, part of upper line of right arm, stem of twig. B, <emph>central figure</emph>, top of left foot. Relief lines used also for outlining portions of the handle ornaments. Brown used on A for details of the fillets, and for the zigzag ends of the left-hand figure's mantle. White paint used on B for the wreath held by the left-hand figure and for the fillets of the other two.</p>

<p>Formerly, with its companion-piece, <ref target="no.39" n="U">no. 39</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8082" type="Vase">Boston 01.8082</rs>), in the Pasquale collection at Curti, near S.

<p>A. Group of three women. The woman in the centre stands in profile to right, holding out an apple in her extended right hand. Her left hand holds a kantharos, and a large thyrsus is leant against her shoulder. She wears an Ionic chiton with kolpos, and has an ivy wreath on her head. The woman facing her looks at a flower which she lifts in her right hand, while her left holds a sprig of ivy. The woman at the left was evidently intended to hold a wreath rendered in white like that in the hands of the corresponding figure on the reverse, but the wreath has been accidentally omitted. Both of the lateral figures wear chiton and himation and disk earrings, and have their heads bound with a 'thick chaplet of straw or wool, such as was often worn at festivals and parties'.<note anchored="true" n="i.37.3"><p>Beazley, <title>Corpus</title>, Oxford, i, Pl. 28, 1-2, p. 23.

<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>B. Three women. The central figure stands in profile holding a thyrsus. Facing her, a woman holding out a white wreath. Behind her, a woman standing in front view, with head turned towards her companions. Her right hand rests on her hip, her left holds a tendril with a flower at its tip. All three are garbed in chiton and himation, and wear earrings. The one at the left has a broad headband (reserved), and the others long, white fillets wound thrice round the head.</p>

<p>The vase is to be grouped with a number of other stamnoi representing various aspects of an Athenian Dionysiac ceremony, identified by Nilsson as the Choes at the Anthesteria.<note anchored="true" n="i.37.4"><p><title>Jahrbuch</title>, xxxi, 1916, pp. 329-32.

<p>If our stamnos stood alone, its subject might be briefly dismissed as 'maenads'. But the women are companions of those on the Chicago stamnos; the apple and the kantharos <pb xml:id="i.38" n="38"/> in the hands of the central figure look as if they might just have been picked up from the table on which they are set in the picture on the obverse of that stamnos.<note anchored="true" n="i.38.1"><p>Figured by Frickenhaus, <title>Lenäenvasen</title>, Pl.

<p>Another stamnos by the painter, recently acquired by Oxford, has three maenads on each side: the reverse is very like that of the Boston vase.</p></note><note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 38. <title>ARV.</title> p. 407, Chicago Painter no. 4.</p></note></p>

<p>Height, without lid, 0.331 m.; width, including handles, 0.373 m.; diameter of body, 0.278 m. Intact, including the lid. Exactly like <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>) except for minute variations in the dimensions.

The handle-ornaments partially outlined in relief, as on <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>). Brown used for details of the hair, the fillets and the ivy wreath, for anatomical markings on the bodies of the men on A, for some of the ends of the mantles on A, for a stripe near the bottom of the flute-player's dress. White used for the berries of the ivy wreath, and for the wreaths of the youth on A, the youth and the central figure on B. The proportions of the two men on A are more correctly given in the small photographs. In the larger photographs their legs are foreshortened.</p>

<p>The provenience is the same as that of <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>). Petersen, <title>Röm.

<p>A. A bearded man and a youth executing a quiet dance movement to music furnished by a flute-girl. Each of the men extends his right arm, with the hand raised, holds a stick in his left hand, and has a mantle hanging over left arm. The bearded man wears a broad fillet of straw or wool, like that of two of the women on <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>). The youth has a white wreath. The girl is dressed in a thin, sleeveless chiton with overfold and kolpos. An ivy wreath with white berries encircles her head; below this her hair falls in short ringlets.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>B. Three komasts. Two of them are bearded men, draped in mantles and carrying sticks, walking to left. The first looks back over his shoulder at his companion, and holds up a skyphos in his right hand. Facing them is a youth, also in a himation, raising his right hand and holding a skyphos in his left. Both men have broad fillets like those already described, the first a white wreath in addition. The youth has only a wreath.</p>

<p>Since the stamnos is a companion-piece to <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>), it is not unreasonable to imagine the six men as participants in the Choes festival. A man, not characterized as a komast, appears with two women on the reverse of the stamnos by the Eupolis painter in the Louvre, which has on the obverse the usual scene of women sacrificing before an image of Dionysos.<note anchored="true" n="i.38.3"><p><rs key="Louvre G 407" type="Vase">Louvre G 407</rs>; Beazley, <title>Att.

<p>Height, including handle, 0.229 m.; without handle, 0.185; diameter, 0.15 m. Broken, with only slight injury to the picture. Relief lines used for all the contours of the silen, including the lyre, for the head and upper arms of the maenad, and for the kantharos but not the thyrsus.

<p>A silen with a wreath on his bald head stands in three-quarter view to right, playing a lyre, while a maenad with kantharos and thyrsus moves away to right, turning her head back inviting him to follow her. Her lyre has long arms and only five strings. The plectrum is attached to its lower arm by a red cord, with a tassel at the place where it is fastened. The maenad wears a Doric peplos open on the right side and girded above the long overfold. She is wreathed with ivy.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the kantharos has cross-bars connecting the handles with the cup, placed not, as would be expected, at the level of the lip, but lower down. This peculiar detail appears also in the kantharos on the stamnos, <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref>, Pl. XVI (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs>).</p>

<p>Height, including handle, 0.23 m.; without handle, 0.193 m.; diameter, 0.151 m. Broken; the left arm of the Greek injured. Relief lines used throughout for the contours of the Greek, but very sparingly for those of the Persian, as follows: the lower part of the cap, most of the left arm, the inner lines of the legs for a distance from the fork. The shield and spear of the Greek, the Persian's sword and the lower part of his quiver are outlined in relief, but not the bow nor the arrow. Brown used for the inner markings on the Greek, black turning to brown for the hair of both figures and for the patterns on the Persian's garments. The bow-string is a thin line added over the glaze, but of no distinguishable colour. The glaze has a slightly bluish tinge.</p>

<p>A youthful Greek advances to right aiming his spear at a bearded Persian, who, having shot an arrow past his adversary, draws back and strives to defend himself with his sword. The Greek wears a crested Attic helmet (decorated on the side with a floral ornament and on the raised cheek-piece with a snake), greaves, and a sword hanging from a cross-belt. The shield on his arm is seen in perspective from within. The Persian is in oriental costume consisting of a cap, with its flaps lowered, a tight-fitting sleeved tunic and trousers. His quiver hangs from a cross-belt. On Persian costume see Gow, <title>J.H.S.</title> xlviii, 1928, pp. 142 f.</p>

<p>Height, including handle, 0.247 m.; without handle, 0.20 m.; diameter, 0.152 m. Broken, but almost complete; the figures only slightly damaged. Relief contours used for the profiles, the body of the youth and the greater parts of the limbs of both figures, but not for the hands, the drapery, the skyphos, the stick. Inner markings in brown. The inscription in red.</p>

<p>From Gela. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1913, p. 92. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 157. <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 355, no. 1. A drawing of the shape in Caskey, <title>G.G.V.</title>, p. 140, no. 92.</p>

<p>A youth moving to right with his body in front view, his mantle hanging over his extended left arm, looks back at a bearded man and holds out a skyphos to him in invitation. The man bends forward and stretches out his right hand. He holds a stick in his left; and his mantle hangs over his left shoulder. In the field below the skyphos, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*A*I*R*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. A break runs across the fourth letter of the name; but it is almost certainly a rho. The other letters are clear, and there were but five. The only occurrence of this love-name.</p>

<p>These four vases are among the earliest specimens of Beazley's oinochoe type 4, a shape which he notes as appearing about 460 and lasting to the end of the century. He counts thirty-four with red-figured pictures,<note anchored="true" n="i.40.1"><p>For example, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 427, nos. 12-14, Kalliope painter; p. 438, nos. 16-17 bis, Shuvalov painter; p. 446, nos. 7-9, Disney painter.</p></note> and thirteen entirely black, some of the latter having impressed designs. All have an indented line round the neck, just below the lip, made before the glaze was put on. The slight variations in proportions and in the mouldings of lip and foot shown by our four examples are recorded in <title>Geometry of Greek Vases</title>.</p>

<p>Our four oinochoai, which were presumably found together, are evidently products of one factory, and quite as evidently decorated by one hand. In <title>Vases in America</title> Beazley noted that the pictures 'stand very close to the Chicago painter, and are perhaps his'. He now has no doubt that they are his. About 450 B.

<p>Height, 0.117 m.; diameter, 0.289 m. Broken, but complete except for nicks in the rim. The lip offset within; the hollow stem moulded at the junction with the foot; the concave edge of the foot reserved. Relief contours throughout, except for some details of the palmettes.

<p>Interior. A bearded man, wrapped in a black-bordered mantle, offers a white fillet to a youth. Both have wreaths on their heads. The exergue is reserved.</p>

<p>Exterior, A. Four figures, divided into two groups by a Doric column. At the left, two men conversing. One holds a white fillet in both hands; the other rests his right hand on a stick. At the right, a youth standing with his back to the column. He has a white fillet bound round his head, and a red one about his right forearm. His left hand holds a branch. He is stretching out his right to receive another white fillet from a man standing opposite him.</p>
<pb xml:id="i.41" n="41"/>
<p>B. A man, leaning forward on his stick, offers a white fillet to a youth who holds out his hand to receive it. Beyond the youth a man in front view with a white fillet in his hands, turning his head to look at another man who holds a red fillet in his left hand and stretches out his right. All the figures, except the youth on side A, are wreathed.</p>

<p>The youths are being decorated with fillets in recognition of athletic victories. See under <ref target="no.16" n="U">i no. 16, p. 13</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.178" type="Vase">Boston 10.178</rs>).</p>

<p>About 460 B.C. By the Euaion painter, an earlier and finer work than <ref target="no.45" n="U">no. 45</ref> and <ref target="no.46" n="U">no. 46</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8078" type="Vase">Boston 01.8078</rs> and <rs key="Boston 91.223" type="Vase">Boston 91.223</rs>), approaching the level of the Demeter on his cup in the Bibliothèque Royale at Brussels. The style of the drawing is especially close to that of the cup in Edinburgh, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 358, no. 38. It also has eight figures on the exterior instead of ten, the usual number on his later works. The youths on the interior are almost exactly alike, except that the one on the Edinburgh cup holds a strigil in his right hand. On the art of the Euaion painter, its origins and affinities, see Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, pp. 35-6, 46-8.</p>

<p>Several cups of this type (see <ref n="U">figure 29</ref>) were decorated by the Euaion painter, e.g. <ref target="no.46" n="U">no. 46</ref>, below (<rs key="Boston 91.223" type="Vase">Boston 91.223</rs>), the Edinburgh cup, one in Munich, and one in the Louvre.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 44. <title>ARV.</title> p. 528, Euaion Painter no. 50.

<p>Height, 0.121 m.; diameter, 0.305 m. Of normal shape. Broken but nearly complete. A piece of the rim with one handle broken off in antiquity and mended with five clamps. Two of the clamps have damaged the faces of the left-hand figure on A and the right-hand figure on B. The foot may have been broken off at the same time, since it appears to have been similarly mended. The statement, recorded by Hoppin, that the foot does not belong to the vase seems unjustified. Slight restorations, especially the left shoulder and arm of the left-hand figure on B. Relief contours throughout. Inner markings in brown. The beards done in relief lines and in brown brush strokes. Red used for the string of the plectrum.</p>

<p>Interior. A bearded komast stands in front view, holding an empty kylix by one handle with his right hand and resting his left hand on his stick. His mantle is hung over his arms. He turns his head, looking at a youth who hurries up to refill the cup from an oinochoe in his right hand.</p>

<p>Exterior, A. Five komasts, as follows from left to right: (1) a youth standing in front view behind a large kalyx-krater set on the ground, holding an oinochoe in his right hand and resting his left on his stick. He is in conversation with (2), a man leaning on his stick and holding a kylix in his right hand. (3) A youth moving to left with body in front view, right hand raised, left holding stick, looking over his shoulder at (4), a man advancing towards him with right arm extended, stick in left hand. (5) A man walking away from the others, but turning back his head and extending his right arm with the hand raised. He also carries a stick.</p>

<p>B. (1) A man walking rapidly to right, but looking back over his shoulder at the last figure on A. (2) A youth moving to right with body thrown back, playing a lyre. (3) A man walking to left with a skyphos in his extended right hand, a stick in his left, looking back at (4), a youth following him, ready to replenish the skyphos from the oinochoe in his right hand. Behind the youth, (5) a man dancing to left with left leg raised, holding a stick over his left shoulder.</p>

<p>All the figures, within and without, wear thick fillets like those on the stamnoi, <ref target="no.38" n="U">no. 38</ref> and <ref target="no.39" n="U">no. 39</ref> (<rs key="Boston 01.8083" type="Vase">Boston 01.8083</rs> and <rs key="Boston 01.8082" type="Vase">Boston 01.8082</rs>), on which see <ref target="i.49" n="U">i p. 49</ref>.

<p>Height, 0.135 m.; diameter, 0.314 m. Slightly broken, but complete. Slight retouching of the surface, but not of any lines of the figures.

<p>Interior. A silen and a maenad in conversation. She stands in front view with her head turned towards him, holding a flute in her right hand, and a thyrsus in her left. Her costume consists of a sakkos and a black-bordered Doric peplos with overfold, open on the right side. He holds out both hands to her, perhaps begging for the flute. Behind him, part of a kalyx-krater standing on the ground.</p>

<p>Exterior, A. Three silens and two maenads, in two groups. The maenad at the left, in sakkos and Doric peplos open on the right side, holds her thyrsus in both hands to defend herself against two silens approaching her from either side with arms extended. The second maenad, carrying a thyrsus, walks to right towards a silen who balances himself on his left leg and holds out his hands towards her. She wears a sakkos, an Ionic chiton with kolpos, and a leopard-skin fastened on her right shoulder and confined at the waist by a broad belt.</p>

<p>B. Three silens and two maenads, in two groups as above. At the left, a maenad between two silens. She is moving to the right, with her head turned back and her face shown in three-quarter view, a thyrsus in her right hand. She wears an Ionic chiton, and over it a short sleeveless garment with patterned border at top and bottom, pinned on both shoulders. The silen at the left approaches her, offering a skyphos. The one at the right stands in an excited pose, his body in front view, his left leg bent, his arms held down with the palms of the hands turned outward. To the right of this group, a maenad in Doric dress with overfold, advances to right, holding a thyrsus in her right hand, and raising her left in a deprecating gesture towards the silen who stands opposite with body bent forward and hands extended to seize her.</p>

<p>All the figures, within and without, except the three women wearing sakkoi, have white wreaths on their heads.</p>

<p>Height, 0.41 m.; diameter, 0.142 m. Broken, but complete; the eyelids and the lips of the woman slightly damaged. On the shoulder an egg pattern and three red-figured palmettes. No relief contours, except for the left shoulder and right leg of Orpheus, and the sword. Red used for the blood issuing from his wound, the fastenings of the strings of the lyre, the fillet of Orpheus, the cord of the plectrum, and the inscription. Brown used for the tattoo marks on the arms of the woman, for the fur on the flaps of her boots, for some of the inner markings on the body of Orpheus. The brown markings are distinguished in the drawing from those in relief lines.</p>

<p>A Thracian woman, advancing in a long stride,<note anchored="true" n="i.44.1"><p>The length of the stride is unfortunately much exaggerated in the drawing owing to the curvature of the vase. The distance between her feet is actually less by a centimetre.</p></note> grasps the lifted arm of Orpheus with her left hand, and holds in her right the sword with which she has already dealt him a wound. Her hair, confined by a broad fillet, falls loose on her shoulders. She wears a short, sleeveless chiton, girded above the overfall, and high Thracian boots of fawn-skin, whose furry inner surface is indicated on the flaps in thinned varnish. She is tattooed on both forearms with a row of chevrons in brown; and the right arm shows in addition three stripes round the wrist, and at the elbow a dotted circle, a pattern which recurs on the boots. Orpheus is sinking to the ground, with blood spurting and streaming from a wound in his right side. His left knee is bent, and the lower leg boldly but unsuccessfully foreshortened. He holds his lyre with his right hand above his head. His mantle, hanging over his left shoulder and right thigh, forms a background for his figure.

<p>The Alkimachos celebrated on our lekythos and on the London amphora, no. 2, was the son of an Epichares, 'perhaps the Epichares represented, about 500, on a cup by the Panaitios painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 523" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 523</rs>, Hartwig, <title>Meisterschalen</title>, Pl. 15, <pb xml:id="i.45" n="45"/> 2, and 26)'.<note anchored="true" n="i.45.1"><p>Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 55, note 3.</p></note> The Alkimachos painter, who decorated the London amphora, worked about 470 B.C., so that the dates are suitable. Alkimachos was a contemporary of Glaukon, as Epichares was of Leagros, the father of Glaukon. But too much stress is not to be laid on this, since the name Epichares was common at Athens.<note anchored="true" n="i.45.2"><p>Cf. Kirchner, <title>Prosopographia Attica</title>, i, p. 327, nos. 4972-5022.</p></note> More interesting is the question whether the Alkimachos mentioned as the father of Axiopeithes on the two white lekythoi by the Achilles painter, nos. 11 and 12, is identical with Alkimachos, son of Epichares. Axiopeithes was a contemporary of a younger Alkimachos, for both are celebrated as <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/s</foreign> on the Goluchow krater by the Lykaon painter. Beazley suggests that Axiopeithes and the younger Alkimachos were cousins. The family tree would be as follows: <figure></figure></p>

<p>One of the two alternative stemmata tentatively proposed by Wernicke<note anchored="true" n="i.45.3"><p><title>Die griechischen Vasen mit Lieblingsnamen</title>, 117. Unjustly characterized as 'reine Phantasiegebilde' by Klein, <title>L.I.</title> 2, p. 4, note 4.</p></note> agrees with this, except that Alkimachos II is made the brother instead of the cousin of Axiopeithes.</p>

<p>About 460 B.C. The attribution of the picture remains an unsolved problem. It has been placed on the same plate with the lekythos by the Achilles master because of its obvious stylistic connexion with works of that artist. But the points of resemblance are in externals. It cannot be from the hand of 'the most classical of all vase-painters'.<note anchored="true" n="i.45.4"><p>Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 50.</p></note> Like the vases grouped by Beazley under the heading 'Meletos painter',<note anchored="true" n="i.45.5"><p><title>V.A.</title>, p. 166; <title>Att.

He is armed with spear and sword, and clothed in a short chiton and a mantle; his petasus hangs at his back from a red cord. It is the moment of the propounding of the riddle; the tenseness of the situation is expressed by the wide-open eyes of both figures, the furrowed brow of the sphinx, and the attitude of Oedipus' right hand.</p>

The woman wears a yellow sleeved chiton and a red himation, the folds of both garments being rendered by lines of thinned glaze which show through the added colours. The girl's sleeveless peplos, girded over the overfall, is without colour. The upper eyelid of the woman is rendered by two lines, instead of the usual single line. Hanging behind the girl's head, a sakkos and an oinochoe.

And he had seen that they are descended from an earlier series with the names Diphilos, Dromippos, and Lichas. Beazley's most recent list of the later group with the names Hygiainon, Axiopeithes, Alkimedes, includes forty-eight vases.<note anchored="true" n="i.46.1"><p><title>Att. V.</title>, p. 376.</p></note> But in <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 49, postscript, he agrees with Luce<note anchored="true" n="i.46.2"><p><title>A.J.A.</title> xxiii, 1919, pp. 19-32.</p></note> and Buschor<note anchored="true" n="i.46.3"><p><title>Attische Lekythen der Parthenonzeit</title>, pp. 12-13.</p></note> in considering 'a number of the lekythoi bearing the love-names Dromippos, Lichas, and Diphilos to be early or fairly early works of the Achilles painter'. He cites thirteen examples, and adds three more of his later period. Still another exquisite work by the painter is now published in F.R. iii, p. 303, fig. 145. It has the name Axiopeithes, and shows a woman with a lyre seated on a rock inscribed 'Helikon'. The list, thus increased to sixty-five works, shows an interesting development of technique. The pictures of the earlier group are drawn in glaze lines on <pb xml:id="i.47" n="47"/> a yellowish ground, and the flesh parts of the figures covered with added white. In the later series the pure white ground has been perfected, making possible such masterpieces of outline drawing as appear on the lekythoi <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref> and <ref target="no.53" n="U">no. 53</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs> and <rs key="Boston 13.187" type="Vase">Boston 13.187</rs>). Finally, if our description of <ref target="no.54" n="U">no. 54</ref> (<rs key="Boston 08.368" type="Vase">Boston 08.368</rs>) is correct, we have in it an example of the later technique in which only dull paint was used for the pictures. The Achilles master thus appears not only as the chief, but 'the determining painter of white lekythoi'.<note anchored="true" n="i.47.1"><p>Beazley, <title>Vases in Poland</title>, p. 50.</p></note><note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 52. <title>ARV.</title> p. 642, Achilles Painter no. 131. <title>AWL.</title> pl. 1, 1; Buschor <title>Grab eines attischen Mädchens</title> pp. 44-5.</p></note></p>

<p>A woman seated in a chair, looking down at her hands in which she evidently held some object, a fillet, a wreath, or a necklace. Standing opposite her, a girl extending her hands in such a way as to suggest that they held a similar object. These objects, rendered in dull colour, may have faded out; or they were inadvertently omitted by the artist. The woman wears a sleeved chiton without colour, and has a pink himation wrapped round her legs. The girl's dress is like that of the corresponding figure on <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs>).

<p>Height, 0.454 m.; diameter, 0.132 m. Badly broken, and discoloured by fire. The left-hand figure is lost, except for the head and neck, the right arm with the basket and fillets, and the feet. The right-hand figure is better preserved; the colour of her mantle has vanished, but most of the lines of its folds have left traces. All the remains of the picture — the outlines and the hair, as well as the dull paint of the right-hand woman's dress and the fillets — have turned to two shades of brown, without lustre, whereas the maeanders above and below and the decoration on the shoulder show the same brown glaze as appears on <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref>, <ref target="no.53" n="U">no. 53</ref>, <ref target="no.55" n="U">no. 55</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs>, <rs key="Boston 13.187" type="Vase">Boston 13.187</rs> and <rs key="Boston 93.106" type="Vase">Boston 93.106</rs>). The shoulder-pattern is of the type regularly found on the white lekythoi by the Achilles painter; in this case the six leaves in dull paint with palmettes are well preserved, as shown in figure 34.</p>

<p>A woman standing in front view with head turned to left, looking at her companion, who stands facing her, holding a long, brown fillet in her right hand, and in her left a large shallow basket over which numerous other fillets are hung. Three of these are drawn in outline, dotted, and with bands round them at intervals, like those on <ref target="no.55" n="U">no. 55</ref> (<rs key="Boston 93.106" type="Vase">Boston 93.106</rs>); the remaining seven are in solid colour, now brown. The pose and costume of the woman at the right are exactly like those of the corresponding figure on <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs>). Her chiton is in solid colour, now light brown, with folds indicated by darker brown lines. The fold lines <pb xml:id="i.48" n="48"/> of her himation now show as white against the discoloured surface. The hair of both figures is drawn in numerous fine lines of lighter and darker brown, giving an unusually soft effect.</p>

<p>About 440-430 B.C. Beazley's attribution to the Achilles painter is indisputable. But the lekythos shows certain peculiarities which distinguish it from both the earlier and the later series of white lekythoi by this master. It is of unusual size, and its contour resembles that of later white lekythoi, in that the greatest diameter is at a lower level than, for example, in <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref>, <ref target="no.53" n="U">no. 53</ref>, <ref target="no.55" n="U">no. 55</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs>, <rs key="Boston 13.187" type="Vase">Boston 13.187</rs>, <rs key="Boston 93.106" type="Vase">Boston 93.106</rs>). The decorative patterns also differ from the normal. The single ground-line found on most of the other examples is replaced by a simple running maeander, such as is sometimes used by the Achilles painter below his red-figured pictures, e.g. <ref target="no.48" n="U">no. 48</ref>, Pl. XXII (<rs key="Boston 01.8077" type="Vase">Boston 01.8077</rs>), but appears otherwise only once on a white lekythos by his hand.<note anchored="true" n="i.48.1"><p>Riezler, Pl. 36; Pfuhl, iii, fig. 543; Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 378, no. 33.</p></note> But the most significant peculiarity is in the technique of the picture, which seems to be without glaze lines. Fairbanks explains this as due to the action of fire. But it is difficult to see why every trace of lustre should have disappeared from the outlines of the figures, while the glaze of the adjoining maeanders remains unimpaired. Moreover, the drawing of the hair is so different from that on <ref target="no.52" n="U">no. 52</ref>, <ref target="no.53" n="U">no. 53</ref>, <ref target="no.55" n="U">no. 55</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.201" type="Vase">Boston 13.201</rs>, <rs key="Boston 13.187" type="Vase">Boston 13.187</rs>, <rs key="Boston 93.106" type="Vase">Boston 93.106</rs>) that it seems impossible to assume it to have been done in glaze paint. And certain details of the faces are without parallels on other lekythoi by the Achilles painter: the eyes of both women have a broad stroke in paler colour almost filling the space between the upper eyelid and the eyebrow; and the red of the lips is indicated by dabs of the same paler tone. The lekythos would thus seem to belong, not to Fairbanks' class V, but to his class VI, 2, which is distinguished by having the picture drawn in dull paint, and the subsidiary decoration in glaze. One other white lekythos, which has been attributed to the Achilles painter, seems to go with ours technically, though artistically it is a less important work.<note anchored="true" n="i.48.2"><p>Athens, <rs key="Athens 1838" type="Vase">Athens 1838</rs>.

Die Zeichnung ist jetzt grauschwarz, ins Oliv spielend, und wirkt glatt und hart wie Firnis, ist aber doch, wie die etwas andere Oberfläche der Firnislinien um den Mäander lehrt, matte Farbe.' Our lekythos thus suggests that the Achilles master may have been the originator of the later technique with pictures in dull colours.<note anchored="true" n="i.48.3"><p>Beazley adds eight lekythoi with paintings in dull colour which he regards as late works of the Achilles painter or by very close imitators: (1) Oxford.

<p>In the centre, a stele set on two steps and surmounted by a simple, flat crowning member. Two fillets, rendered in dull black paint, are tied about its shaft. A third fillet, drawn in outline, is placed on the lower step, its ends tied together so that it has the form of a wreath. Another, of similar design, is draped round the stele, with its ends hanging over the top step. At the left of the stele a woman stands in profile, holding a perfume vase, <emph>smegmatotheke</emph>, in her right hand. She is clothed in a sleeved chiton drawn in outline, and a red mantle. At the right, a woman in a diaphanous Doric peplos, with long overfold, holding out her hands. According to Robinson, the object in her hands is 'a red fillet almost effaced'; but no trace of this now remains.</p>

Evidently they were light in colour and of some fairly stiff material, since they keep a circular form when their ends are tied together. Beazley suggests that they may have been made of straw,<note anchored="true" n="i.49.2"><p><title>Corpus</title>, Oxford, i, p. 23, Pl. 28.</p></note> a theory which is supported by the fact that bands are tied about them at intervals.</p>

<p>Height, 0.421 m.; diameter, 0.123 m. Broken, but practically complete. On the shoulder, tongue pattern and design of three palmettes, black-figured. No relief contours, except for the spear. Brown used for two stripes near the bottom of the woman's dress, for the edge of her mantle, for stripes round the youth's scabbard. Red and white used for the fillets tied about the stele.</p>

<p>In the centre, a tall, slender stele, on a two-stepped base, and surmounted by an akroterion composed of two pairs of volutes placed vertically, with a palmette above. Three fillets, the upper and lower ones white, the central one red, are tied about the shaft. At the left, a woman in sleeved chiton and himation, a diadem with three leaves in her hair, holding out a smegmatotheke. At the right, a youth, armed with spear and sword, wearing a short chiton, a chlamys pinned in front by a round brooch, a petasus hanging at his back.</p>

<p>Fragments of a large hydria-kalpis of rather slender proportions (height originally about 0.41 m.; diameter, 0.29 m.). The lip and the greater part of the left side missing, and the preserved portions put together from many pieces. The vertical handle and the right-hand horizontal handle preserved. Reserved bands with black stripes painted on them at the junction of the handles with the body. Relief contours used only for the profile of Amphiaraos, the outlines of his corselet to the waist, part of the lower line of his right arm, the forehead, nose, and upper lip of the nurse. The details of the sides of the corselet in brown. The inscriptions in red.</p>

<p>From Athens. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1903, p. 71, no. 61. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 166, fig. 102 (the nurse with Amphilochos). <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 381, no. 12.</p>

<p>Amphiaraos, equipped for the fateful expedition against Thebes, stands in the centre, his body in front view, his left hand holding his spear, his head turned to the left, looking at Eriphyle of whose figure only the top of the head remains. They were probably represented clasping hands. At the right, a nurse, in front view, looking to left, stretching out her right hand and holding the child, Amphilochos, on her left arm. Amphiaraos wears a pilos, a leather cuirass over his short chiton, and a cloak draped over his left elbow. His sword hangs from his side by a crossbelt. Eriphyle has a diadem decorated with three leaves. The nurse has short hair hanging in loose curls, and wears a black-bordered Doric peplos girded above the overfold. The body of the boy on her arm is seen from the back. His right hand grasps the nurse's shoulder. A fillet is tied about his head; and a cord, with three amulets attached to it, is hung over his right shoulder. The bowed head of Amphiaraos, the gesture of the nurse, the fear shown by the attitude of the child, and especially the wide open eyes of all three figures fixed on the same point, combine to give a dramatic intensity to the scene, such as is hardly equalled among the vase paintings of the period.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>The names of Amphiaraos and Eriphyle are inscribed above their heads in letters carelessly drawn and so faint as to be nearly illegible: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A[*M*F]*I*A*R*H*O*S</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A[*M*F]*I*A*R*A*O*S</foreign> (not <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A[*M*F]*I*A*R*E*O*S</foreign>, as given in the <title>Annual Report</title>); and <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*E*R*I]*F*U*L*H</foreign>.</p>

<p>Representations of the story of Amphiaraos are comparatively rare on red-figured vases. The best known is the pelike in Lecce by the Chicago painter, on which Polyneikes is offering the necklace to Eriphyle.<note anchored="true" n="i.51.1"><p><rs key="Leece 570A" type="Vase">Leece 570A</rs>; F.R. ii, Pl. 66, 2.</p></note> Beazley notes also the following: (1) fragment of a cup of archaic style in Marseilles, with departure of the Seven, Vasseur, <title>L'Origine de Marseille</title>, Pl. 13, 8-10. (2) A hydria in Petrograd by the Niobid painter, the closest parallel to our hydria, since it shows Amphiaraos and Eriphyle clasping hands; his name is inscribed beside his head.<note anchored="true" n="i.51.2"><p>The drawing in <title>Mon. d. Inst.</title> iii, Pl. 54, shows the five figures much restored, as Beazley informs me: (1) man at left end, the upper half genuine; (2) small girl, only the head preserved; (3) Eriphyle, the head, shoulders, and hands; (4) Amphiaraos, the upper half of the figure; (5) youth standing on rock (?), genuine as far as he remembers.</p></note> (3) A bell-krater in Syracuse by the Danae painter, <title>Mon. Ant.</title> xiv, 1904, Pl. IV, Amphiaraos, about to depart, gives a sword to the boy Alkmaion (the figures not identified by inscriptions). (4) A small hydria of free style in Berlin, <title>A.Z.</title>, 1885, Pl. 15, with a domestic scene — Eriphyle seated with the child Alkmaion in her lap, Amphiaraos standing behind her. (5) An amphora in the British Museum, <rs key="London E 282" type="Vase">London E 282</rs>, P. Gardner, <title>J.H.S.</title> ix, 1888, Pl. III, attributed by Beazley to the painter of the Bologna Boreas, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 306, no. 21. A. warrior. B. woman with child. Gardner's interpretation of the figures as Hektor and Andromache is perhaps preferable.</p>

<p>About 440-430 B. C. The work, which shows strong resemblances to the style of the Achilles master, has been attributed by Beazley to one of his followers, named after the pelike, <ref target="no.59" n="U">no. 59</ref> (<rs key="Boston 76.45" type="Vase">Boston 76.45</rs>), the Dwarf painter. The composition is based on the Achilles painter's departure scenes, e.g. the London stamnos, <title>J.H.S.</title> xxxiv, 1914, Pl. XV. Twelve vases decorated by the Dwarf painter are listed in <title>Attische Vasenmaler</title>, to which a Nolan amphora in Edinburgh is to be added. In addition to the kalpis and the pelike on Pl. XXVII, the Museum possesses a Nolan amphora, 76.43, no. 6 in Beazley's list, which is by the Dwarf painter. It does not seem of sufficient interest to warrant its publication here.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part I) No. 58. <title>ARV.</title> p. 651, Dwarf Painter no. 15.</p></note></p>

<p>Height, 0.241 m.; diameter of body, 0.175 m. Intact. The handles are ridged; a small inverted palmette, red-figured, below the lower end of each. The edge of the base reserved. Relief contours as follows: side A, the chin and neck of the youth, the lower lip of the dwarf, and most of the outlines of the legs of the dwarf and the dog. Thinned paint used for inner markings on the dwarf's body (only partially visible in the photograph), for the ends of his hair, for hair on the dog's neck and for his collar. The illustration of side A on the plate is made from two photographs joined together.</p>

<p>On the obverse a youth enveloped in a large himation strides to right with head erect, followed by his dwarf servant, who holds a large dog by the collar with his left hand and has a knotted stick in his right. A cloak hangs over his shoulder. He turns his head back, as if he were scowling at the figure on the reverse, a youth in himation carrying a stick, who seems to be inclined to join the party.</p>

The lower part, shaped like an altar, is set on two steps and surmounted by a pediment with curved sides ending in volutes at the top and ends. The upper pair of volutes supports a palmette with a red centre. Upon this lower structure stands a stele, also with a two-stepped base, its upper part cut off by the maeander band of the shoulder. A red fillet is tied about the shaft of the stele; and two others, draped round its base, hang over the lower member. A black wreath is attached to the face of this; and a black lekythos (foreshortened in the photograph) lies on the bottom step.</p>
<pb xml:id="i.53" n="53"/>
<p>At the left a nude youth stands in an easy pose, his body in front view, his head turned towards the girl beside him, his left hand holding a pair of spears, his right resting on his hip. His sword hangs at his side from a cross-belt, and a red chlamys is draped over his left elbow. His hair is sketchily rendered in fine lines of brown on a lighter brown ground. The folds of the chlamys appear to have been drawn first in red, and hidden when the whole garment was painted red. Afterwards fold lines in dull black were placed above the red ground. The spears were first drawn in two lines of glaze paint; these were later strengthened by thicker lines in dull paint less carefully drawn.</p>

<p>At the right a girl stands in profile facing the stele; she looks at the perfume vase held on her right hand; a tablet(?) hangs by numerous cords from her left hand. Her hair is sketchily rendered in zigzag lines of light brown. The complete contour of her figure is carefully drawn in glaze lines, and no trace of a garment remains.<note anchored="true" n="i.53.1"><p>In the photograph on the plate the slenderness of this figure is unfortunately exaggerated. Cf. fig. 43.</p></note></p>

<p>For a similar double grave monument cf. the white lekythos, <rs key="Berlin 2448" type="Vase">Berlin 2448</rs>, Fairbanks, i, p. 265, no. 11, Benndorf, <title>Griechische und Sicilische Vasenbilder</title>, Pl. XXIV. 4. On the smegmatotheke, see above, <ref target="i.49" n="U">i p. 49</ref>. The object in the girl's left hand is explained by Fairbanks as a tablet intended to be attached to the stele as an offering. He compares the tablet held by Hermes on a hydria in Petrograd,<note anchored="true" n="i.53.2"><p>By the Pan painter. Gerhard, <title>A. V.</title>, Pls. 50-1, I; Beazley, <title>Att.

Smith, <title>Cat.</title> iii, Pl. V. School of Makron, Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title> p. 223, no. 20.</p></note>. The object held by the woman on the white lekythos, <rs key="Athens 1761" type="Vase">Athens 1761</rs>, which he explains as a tablet, is called by Riezler a fillet rolled up.<note anchored="true" n="i.53.4"><p><title>Weissgrundige Attische Lekythen</title>, Pl. 31, p. 107.</p></note></p>

<p>Most commentators on our lekythos have assumed that the girl's garment was added in dull paint which has entirely disappeared.<note anchored="true" n="i.53.5"><p>See especially Riezler, l.c., p. 21, note 45, who cites other instances of the disappearance of drapery.</p></note> But Studniczka cites the figure as an example of the survival of ritual nudity into the Periclean age. And Fairbanks remarks that 'in this instance it is not absolutely clear that the young woman's garment was ever drawn'. The closest parallel is on the lekythos, <rs key="Athens 1797" type="Vase">Athens 1797</rs>,<note anchored="true" n="i.53.6"><p>Riezler, Pl. 32</p></note>which is by the same hand as ours. Another parallel, also on a vase by the same hand, is seemingly furnished by the lekythos <ref target="no.61" n="U">no. 61</ref> (<rs key="Boston 96.721" type="Vase">Boston 96.721</rs>); but in this case the lower part of the woman's figure was apparently not drawn in glaze outline, and there are faint traces of a red mantle.</p>

<p>Height, 0.381 m.; diameter, 0.123 m. Broken, but nearly complete. The surface crackled.

<p>In the centre a stele with simple top and a small moulding at the base of the shaft, set on two steps. Two red fillets are tied round the shaft, and another is draped about the steps. At the left a woman stands with her body almost in front view, her head in profile, holding a large, shallow basket from which several red fillets depend. Her short hair is sketchily rendered in broad lines of glaze varying from light to dark brown. The contours of the upper part of her figure and of her feet are drawn in glaze lines, whereas the contours of her legs show as faint grey lines. There are traces of a red garment on her right upper arm, across her ankles, and to the right of the leg. The side of the basket is decorated with a wreath and a toothed pattern in dull black. Facing her at the right of the stele, a bearded man with body in front view and head turned towards her, his right hand resting on the top of a knotted stick, his left arm enveloped in a bright red himation.<pb xml:id="i.54" n="54"/> The contours of his legs and the folds of the mantle are drawn in lines of deeper red. The stick is done in glaze lines with dull black lines inaccurately laid over them.</p>

<p>The two lekythoi, <ref target="no.60" n="U">no. 60</ref> and <ref target="no.61" n="U">no. 61</ref> (<rs key="Boston 00.359" type="Vase">Boston 00.359</rs> and <rs key="Boston 96.721" type="Vase">Boston 96.721</rs>), are obviously by the same hand. All four heads show a strong resemblance in the long nose, the small upper lip and full lower lip, the double line of the nostril, the drawing of the upper eyelid by two lines with a projecting line to indicate the lashes. The rendering of the hair in hasty zigzag brush strokes, the short necks, the drawing of the frontal feet, the overlaying of the spear on <ref target="no.60" n="U">no. 60</ref> (<rs key="Boston 00.359" type="Vase">Boston 00.359</rs>) and the stick on <ref target="no.61" n="U">no. 61</ref> (<rs key="Boston 96.721" type="Vase">Boston 96.721</rs>) with black lines are further points of similarity. Buschor connects these two lekythoi with numerous others which he ascribes to the Thanatos painter, so called after the well-known lekythos in London, no. 10 below (<rs key="London D 58" type="Vase">London D 58</rs>). He regards this artist as influenced by the Achilles painter, and to be ranked second to him among the decorators of white lekythoi.</p>

<p>Height, 0.034 m.; diameter, 0.249 m. Broken into three pieces, but almost complete. The ends of the seated youth's mantle and the legs of his chair slightly injured. Two holes for suspension near the rim. The exterior black except for a tongue pattern round the boss. No relief contours. Brown used for inner markings on most of the figures, for the edges of mantles and stripes on dresses, for the necklace of the woman holding phialae, for dots on the phialae, for details of the chairs, for the hatching on the basket held by Nike, and for the dots on Nike's wings. White dots on the fillet of the seated youth, and on the headbands of the woman conversing with him, the woman watching the dancer and the Nike. Three twigs set upright in the basket are also done in white.</p>

<p>From Athens; said to have been found near Sunium. <title>Ann. Rep.</title> 1897, p. 27, no. 14. Beazley, <title>V.A.</title>, p. 167, fig. 103. Hoppin, i, p. 83, no. 5. Beazley, <title>Att. V.</title>, p. 386, no. 74.</p>

<p>On the omphalos, a winged Nike running to left carrying a sacrificial basket with three high handles and an oinochoe. She wears chiton and himation and a headband with white dots. Three twigs, done in white, rise from the handles of the basket.</p>
<pb xml:id="i.55" n="55"/>
<p>The main picture represents three men entertained by courtesans — eight figures forming three groups. (1) A bearded man seated in a chair, his mantle wrapped about his legs, his right hand resting on a stick, his left hand grasping his right upper arm, is listening intently to the music furnished by a girl standing opposite him playing the flute. She has short hair, and wears a sleeveless chiton with overfold. Her mantle lies on a stool behind her. (2) A youth seated in a chair, his right hand holding a stick, his left arm resting on the back of the chair, turns his head towards a woman at his right with whom he is in conversation. His himation covers his left arm and his legs. His head is bound by a fillet with white dots. The woman, wearing a headband with white dots, a chiton and an himation covering her whole body including the arms, leans forward as she talks to him. At the left a woman stands in front view looking at the youth, holding an oinochoe in her right hand and in her left three phialae for the men to drink from. She wears a sakkos, a sleeved chiton and himation, and a necklace with a pendant. (3) A girl dancing, watched by a youth and a woman. She moves to the left with her head turned back and her hands raised, holding castanets. She wears a headband and a short chiton, fringed at the bottom, with black, dotted borders and brown horizontal stripes. The youth at her right leans on the stick and extends his right arm towards her. He is wrapped in an himation. Between them, the dancer's himation lies on a cushioned chair. The woman at the left, in sleeved chiton, himation, and headband with white dots, also stretches out her right hand towards the dancer, and, holds in her left a heavy staff, like a decapitated thyrsus. The lifelike bird standing on the ground behind the woman forms a fourth member of this group. Two chests, one of them with the lid raised, a cylindrical box with conical cover, and a pair of castanets effectively fill voids in the composition.</p>
<milestone ed="JG" unit="card"/>
<p>In form the phiale closely resembles those carried by girls on the Parthenon frieze. Examples in clay are fairly numerous (Beazley counts 62), but few have figure decoration. Three plain phialae signed by Nikosthenes are illustrated in Hoppin, <title>Black-figured Vases</title>: <rs key="London B 368" type="Vase">London B 368</rs>, p. 208, no. 21; <rs key="Paris, Cab.

<p>Height, 0.241 m.; diameter, 0.177 m. Broken, and some small bits missing. The injuries are shown by shading in the drawing. Palmettes below the handles, which are slightly concave on either side of the central ridge. No relief contours. Brown used for the edges of the dresses and mantles, for the eye-hole of the mask on the ground, and for inner markings. The curved brown stroke indicating the crease in the bent elbow of the left-hand figure has been accidentally omitted in the drawing; cf. the drawing in <title>V.A.</title>, fig. 104.</p>

<p>On the obverse, two youths — members of a dramatic chorus — attiring themselves as women. Their costume consists of a mask with a kerchief wound about the hair, a short chiton with a brown border running down one side, and high boots. The figure at the right is pulling a boot on to his raised right leg. His mask lies on the ground in front of him. The broad fillet tied about his head is doubtless intended to keep the mask from chafing him.<note anchored="true" n="i.56.2"><p>Cf. the fillets worn by warriors in arming scenes, e.g. three youths on the cup, <ref target="no.31" n="U">no. 31</ref>, Pl.

The costumes suggest maenads or Thracian women.</p>

<p>On the reverse a sketchily drawn figure of a bearded man in himation leaning on a stick: probably thought of as watching the scene on the obverse.</p>

<p>Height, 0.332 m.; diameter, 0.166 m. A Nolan amphora with ridged handles. Unbroken. No relief contours. Brown used for the edges of the mantles, for stripes on the dress of the woman on A, for the folds at the bottom of the dress of the woman on B, for marks on the face of the altar, for details of the antlers, for dots on the side of the phiale. White used for the cords wound round the hair of the women, for the man's wreath (stem and dots) except the leaves, for the fire on the altar, for the wine issuing from the oinochoe and the phiale.</p>

<p>On the obverse, a libation scene. In the centre a low altar with raised ends (<foreign xml:lang="greek">krateutai/</foreign>), between which a fire is burning. The smoke is done in white paint. On the face, in brown, two dots and carelessly scrawled lines, perhaps intended to represent blood. At the right a bearded man, wreathed and enveloped in an himation, holding out a phiale from which drops of wine are falling upon the altar. The phiale is decorated with a row of dots, like those represented on <ref target="no.62" n="U">no. 62</ref> (<rs key="Boston 97.371" type="Vase">Boston 97.371</rs>). At the left, a woman in sleeved chiton and himation, a white cord wound five times about her hair, pours wine into the phiale from an oinochoe in her extended right hand. Above, between the heads of the figures, a pair of antlers, suggesting that the place is a sanctuary.</p>

<p>On the reverse, a woman in himation, her hair bound by a white cord, stands with her body shown from the back, her head turned to the left, her right arm extended to the right.</p>

<p>Height, 0.227 m.; diameter, 0.136 m. Broken and incomplete. The figures at the ends of the picture are only partly preserved; the standing Amazon's right upper leg, and part<pb xml:id="i.57" n="57"/> of the ornament under the handle are missing. Relief contours throughout, except for the ornament at the back. Brown used for most of the inner markings on the bodies and on the interior of the shield of the left-hand figure. Many details in relief, originally gilded: the complete surfaces of the helmets, except that of the youth at the right; raised lines along the edges of the helmets with the same exception; a boss on the youth's pilos; the handles of both shields; the rim of the shield of the left-hand figure, with dots added; two rows of bosses on the front of the standing Amazon's chiton; several bosses on the horse's bridle; both ends of the standing Amazon's spear; the point of Hippolyte's spear; the sword of Theseus. Remains of gold on the point of the standing Amazon's spear, on Hippolyte's helmet, on Theseus' sword. Red or white used for the irregular ground-line below the figures, and for the inscriptions.

<p>An amazonomachy; five figures in two groups. At the right, Theseus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*H*S[*E*U*S]</foreign>), assisted by a youth, advances to attack Hippolyte (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*P*P*O*L*U*T*H</foreign>). Theseus, nude, wearing a crested Corinthian helmet, his shield on his left arm, his scabbard hanging by a cross-belt, holds his sword in his lifted right hand. The Amazon reins in her prancing horse as she aims her spear at her opponent's body. She wears a leather cuirass over a short chiton, and a crested Attic helmet with cheek-pieces lowered. Her bow and quiver hang at her side. The youth behind Theseus, represented on a smaller scale, thrusts at the horse with his spear. He wears a pilos, a chlamys, sandals, and gaiters. At the left, an Amazon on foot in combat with a Greek, of whose name only the final <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S</foreign> remains. She wears a helmet like that of Hippolyte, and richly decorated tight-sleeved chiton and trousers. Her bow and quiver hang from a cross-belt. She grasps her spear with both hands raised above her head, and thrusts at her opponent, who advances his shield to deflect the blow, and holds his sword in his lowered right hand. His Attic helmet has the cheek-pieces raised. His scabbard (invisible) hangs from a cross-belt.</p>

<div type="Preface">
<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>This publication, the first part of which appeared in 1931, was planned with care and taste by Lacey Davis Caskey, and the credit for it should go in greatest measure to him. After his death in 1944, the Trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts invited me to complete the undertaking, and I accepted the more readily because I felt that Caskey himself would have wished it, and because I was glad to have the opportunity of continuing the work of a friend and scholar whose mind and character I admired and from whom I had received much help and kindness through many years.</p>

<p>It is intended that this second instalment should soon be followed by a third and final one. I may perhaps add that although the stock of the first part held in England was destroyed by enemy action, copies may still be obtained from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Let my first expression of gratitude go to the Trustees of the Museum, to the Director, Mr. G. H. Edgell, and the Secretary, Mr. Ashton Sanborn, for the honour of the invitation; then to the Acting Curator of the Classical Collection, Professor George Henry Chase, for his courteous welcome and for the ideal conditions in which he enabled me to work. Professor Chase has also kindly read the proofs.</p>

<p>The drawings of nos. 95 and 96 in the present volume, and of no. 76 (the reverse), are by Caskey, those of no. 70 by the late F. Anderson. The rest are by Miss Suzanne E. Chapman, in whom the Museum is fortunate to have found an artist of exceptional skill, feeling, patience, and devotion. Miss Chapman has also redrawn the shape-outlines in the text after Caskey's more complicated drawings in his <title>Geometry of Greek Vases</title>, and has made a few corrections in Anderson's copies of no. 70. The photographs are by Mr. Edward J. Moore of the Museum of Fine Arts, whose experience and understanding, combined with his technical mastery, have reached a happy solution of the far from simple problems presented by the photography of Greek vases.</p>

<p>Miss Edith Marshall of the Museum of Fine Arts saved me much trouble by her ever willing help in all sorts of junctures.</p>

<p>I have paid three visits to Boston, in 1914, in 1946, and in 1948. Before my second visit, and between my second and my third, Dr. Dietrich von Bothmer was so good as to examine many vases for me and to answer the questions I had put to him about this or that particular. Many of his replies I checked during my second and third visits and always found accurate. He also drew my attention to a good many points that I had not myself noticed; and it was a real help to me, when working at a distance, to know that I had an observer on whom I could absolutely rely. This is only a small part of what my studies in America and elsewhere owe to Dietrich von Bothmer.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Professor Antonio Minto and Professor Reinhard Herbig for permission to publish fragments in Florence and Heidelberg, to Professor Emilie Haspels for the photograph of a fragment in Thasos, and to Professor Georges Daux for permission to figure it. From the Oxford University Press I have had full and ready cooperation. My wife, as always, has allowed me to draw upon her fund of common sense and of unusual knowledge derived from lively and accurate observation.</p>

<p>Lastly, I feel that in this place I should not fail to rememorate the names of the American and the Englishman to whom the great collection of Greek vases in Boston owes so much: Edward Perry Warren and his friend John Marshall.</p>

<p>Formerly in the Bourguignon collection at Naples. <title>Jb</title>. 7 pl. 5 (Hartwig), whence Roscher s.v. Pentheus p. 1931; Philippart <title>Iconographie des Bacchantes d'Euripide</title> pl. 12. These publications are incomplete. The Death of Pentheus. About 520-510 B.C., by Euphronios (<title>CF</title>. p. 33 no. 5; <title>ARV</title>. p. 19 no. 5 and p. 948: see below).</p>

<p>Pentheus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*E*N*Q*E*U*S</foreign>) has already been torn to pieces. Two women rush along holding between them the bleeding upper part. One, Galene (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*G*A*L*E*N*E</foreign> retr.), grasps the right arm with one hand and the shoulder with the other, to tear the arm off: a somewhat similar action is described by Euripides in the <title>Bacchae</title> (<bibl n="Eur. Ba. 1125">Eur. Ba. 1125</bibl>). The other woman, looking round, holds the left arm near the shoulder with her right hand, while her left hand (now missing) holds the thyrsus. A third maenad follows, looking round, her thyrsus raised in her left hand; the right hand is missing, and may have held some portion of the dead man. The right foot of this figure, with part of the chiton, was formerly in Freiburg (<title>CF</title>. p. 32, 5) and was acquired by the Museum in 1936. All three women wear chitons, himatia of 'Ionic' fashion, and head-fillets.</p>

<p>The other fragments are floaters: (<emph>b</emph>) gives head and right arm of a woman holding one of Pentheus' legs, facing to left but probably running to right; (<emph>c</emph>) the lower half of a woman running to right (the light area on the left is a chip); (<emph>d</emph>) left shank of a woman running to right, holding a thyrsus in her right hand; in front of her, whether held by her or another, a piece of the bleeding body; (<emph>e</emph>) the upper half of a woman's head to right.</p>

<p>The contours are in relief-lines, except the off edge of the skirts and, as frequently in early red-figure, the lips, although the mouth is a relief-line. There is a brown interfold on the Freiburg fragment; the upper edge of Galene's himation is rendered by five crinkled brown lines. The outline of the hair is incised, except the outline of the forehead-hair, which in four out of six figures is reserved.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The name Galene is given to a maenad on an Attic bell-krater, of the late fifth century, which was formerly in the Coghill, Hope, and Cowdray collections (Millingen <title>Vases de Coghill</title> pl. 19: see Tillyard <title>Hope Vases</title> p. 85 no. 141, and <title>Cat. Sotheby 2nd Dec. 1946</title> no. 55).</p>

<p>The drawing is fresh and interesting, but in some parts, especially of the drapery, careless and inexpert. Thus, in the left-hand figure on the large fragment, the upper edge of the chiton is not indicated; the middle 'pleat' of the himation has no vertical on the left; the right foot has a toe too few; and the left hand is drawn as if it were a right, or rather the artist has not made up his mind whether he was drawing a back-view figure or not. In Galene, the hole of the sleeve turns in the wrong direction; the upper edge of the chiton is again omitted; the line of the right shin is wanting; it is odd also that the upper edge of the himation should be in brown not black. In the himation of the third maenad, the lower zigzags of the flying part are omitted on the right and done in brown on the left; the ball of the thumb is not indicated.</p>

<p>All these faults considered, it may seem strange that I should attribute the psykter to the famous Euphronios. It is to be compared not so much with his finest work as with the calyx-krater in Berlin, the pelike in Chicago and Villa Giulia, the Dresden hydria, or the lively subsidiary figures on the neck of his volute-krater in Arezzo: but no comparison need be excluded; even in the masterpiece, the krater in the Louvre, the difference in quality between the magnificent set-piece of Herakles and Antaios on the one hand, and on the other the female figures flanking it or the youths on the reverse, is great: place the Boston psykter beside these and the resemblance will be found close. In <title>CF</title>. p. 33 no. 5 I spoke of the psykter as 'recalling Euphronios'; in the text of <title>ARV</title>. (p. 19) as 'a slighter work in his manner and perhaps even from his hand'; when I wrote the addenda (p. 948) I had come to feel sure that it was 'a slight work by the painter himself'. Slight; and early.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A list of vases by Euphronios is given in <title>ARV</title>. pp. 15-19 and 948; but I no longer think that no. 9, the Swallow pelike in Leningrad, can be his. No. 8, the neck-amphora <rs key="Leningrad 610" type="Vase">Leningrad 610</rs>, from Vulci is now published in <title>Marburger Winckelmann-Programm</title> 1949 pl. 3: I should now place it under 'manner of Euphronios'. In no. 10, the neck-pelike partly in Villa Giulia, partly in the University of Chicago, the animal the young man is <pb xml:id="ii.2" n="2"/> playing with is not a puppy but a weasel (the same animal is figured on a fourth-century squat lekythos with design in added red, Etruscan or Italic, from Leprignano, in Villa Giulia). A new vase by Euphronios is a neck-pelike in Villa Giulia: on one side a youth leads a horse; on the other a man, seated, chastises a young boy with a sandal: on each side of the vase, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*E*A*G*R*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. Add also a fragment, attributed by Albizzati and Belloni, in the Museo di Archeologia (Castello Sforzesco), Milan (<title>AJA</title>. 1950 pl. 20, c: probably from a calyx-krater: Herakles), and a fragment of a cup decorated inside only, attributed by Dietrich von Bothmer, in the Louvre (I, archer, with <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*N*E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>: — i.e. <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*Xaxrulio]nepoiesen</foreign>: ?). Peters has made the attractive suggestion (<title>Studien zu den panathenäischen Preisamphoren</title> p. 56) that a small fragment of a black-figured Panathenaic amphora in Athens, <rs key="Athens, Acr. 931" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 931</rs> (Graef pl. 56), may be by Euphronios.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) Pp. 1-2. Important additions to the list of vases by Euphronios have now been made by Villard in <title>Mon. Piot</title> 45 pp. 1-13.

<p>Nowhere else is Pentheus bearded, except on a Greco-Roman gem in the British Museum (Walters <title>Cat. Gems</title> pl. 22, 1629: Philippart <title>Ic</title>. p. 68 no. 160); and it has been observed that the part which Agave might have been expected to play (<bibl n="Eur. Ba. 1125">Eur. Bacch. 1125</bibl>) is given to Galene. The other representations of the subject have been collected by Hartwig (<title>Jb</title>. 7 pp. 153-64), Curtius (<title>Pentheus</title>), and Philippart (<title>Ic</title>. pp. 50-66); see also Séchan pp. 102-6, and Dodds <title>Euripides Bacchae</title> pp. xxx-xxxii.

Hauser's able commentary in <title>Jb.</title> 10 pp. 108-13 has been improved in many points by Norman Gardiner.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the palaestra, where young athletes are receiving instruction. Athletes and instructors have their names written against them, but it is not always certain which name pertains to which figure. There are four groups: one of wrestlers, the others of acontists. The chief group is (9-12) a pair of wrestlers between two bearded trainers. One wrestler is about to throw the other, who is letting himself be thrown.<note anchored="true" n="ii.3.2"><p>So Norman Gardiner, rightly: Hauser gives a different explanation (<title>Jb.</title> 27 p. 109).
</p>
<p>In the Turin psykter by Euthymides (below, <ref target="ii.7" n="U">ii p. 7</ref>, no. B. 7), one wrestler may be allowing himself to be thrown. He is not Kerkyon as used to be thought, but as Philippart pointed out (<title>Coll. cér. en Italie</title> i p. 9), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*L[*U*T]*O*S</foreign>, a companion of Theseus. Theseus was the inventor of scientific wrestling (<bibl n="Paus. 1.39.3">Paus. 1.39.3</bibl>; schol. <bibl n="Pind. N. 5">Pind. N. 5.89</bibl>, b). The bout is a 'friendly', and the scene the palaestra.
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/></p>
<p>On the cup Goluchow, Czartoryski, 167 (<title>CV.</title> pl. 39, 1) an athlete stands still, with his hands clasped at the back of his neck, and allows another to try and throw him (there is some restoration, but the motive is plain).</p></note> The trainer on the left is giving the order; his companion on the right is less active but equally attentive.</p>

<p>Of the acontists, Norman Gardiner writes (<title>JHS</title> 27 p. 258; <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 347): 'Two of the youths (4 and 5) are testing the bindings; resting one end of the javelin on the ground, and holding it firm with their left hand, they pass the right hand along the shaft to see that the binding is secure. A third (1) in the same position is passing his fingers through the loop, the lines of which have disappeared. A fourth (8) has already inserted his fingers into the loop, and raising the javelin breast-high, presses it forward with his left hand so as to draw the thong tight.'</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.4" n="4"/>
<p>The right-hand acontist (5) of the first trio (3-5) is in the same attitude as one of the athletes on the archaic statue-base in Athens (<title>JHS</title> 42 pl. 6, 2; Norman Gardiner <title>Athl.</title> fig. 53; Blümel <title>Sport der Hellenen</title> p. 73), except that he leans farther over towards his right side, so that the right arm is lower, the left arm higher, and the left heel raised slightly from the ground. These are the only two examples of this attitude that I can recall: there are kindred figures on vases of the later archaic period, but they have the right leg frontal not the left: so, for example, on a neck-amphora by the Kleophrades Painter in Leningrad (<title>Kl.</title> pl. 25; <title>ARV</title>. p. 122 no. 16), on the calyx-krater by the Troilos Painter in Copenhagen (<title>Annali</title> 1846 pl. M, whence Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 303; <title>CV.</title> pl. 128: <title>ARV</title>. p. 191 no. 10), and on a lekythos by the Cartellino Painter in Athens (<title>Eph.</title> 1907 p. 229 fig. 4, 1). In these the right foot is planted firmly on the ground; on the amphora by Phintias in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 42" type="Vase">Louvre G 42</rs>; FR. pl. 112, whence Gardiner <title>Athl.</title> fig. 123; <title>CV</title> pl. 28, 5: <title>ARV</title> p. 22, no. 1) the right foot, slightly three-quartered, rests on the ground with the forepart only, and this leads on to the figures in which the right foot is shown extended, with only the toes touching the ground: stamnos by Euphronios in Leipsic (<title>Jb</title> 11 p. 185: <title>ARV</title>. p. 16 no. 6); hydria by Euphronios in Dresden (<title>Anz.</title> 1892 p. 165, 31: <title>ARV</title>. p. 17 no. 11); amphora in London, <rs key="London E 256" type="Vase">London E 256</rs> (<title>JHS</title> 27 pl. 19, whence Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 348; <title>CV.</title> pl. 3, 2: <title>ARV</title>. p. 31, foot); calyx-krater by the Kleophrades Painter in Tarquinia (Hartwig p. 417; <title>Kl.</title> pl. 17: <title>ARV</title>. p. 123 no. 31); cup by the Eretria Painter in the Villa Giulia (<title>CV.</title> pl. 36, 3: <title>ARV</title>. p. 728 no. 57): here the athlete is about to throw, is beginning his run; whereas on our vase, on the relief, and on the vases in Leningrad and Athens, he is merely preparing the javelin.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The other athlete in this group is at an earlier stage of preparation, is probably sliding the thong into place.</p>

<p>The second trio (6-8) forms a well-planned pendant to the first, and is constructed on the same lines, with a bending figure between two upright ones. The bending athlete has just picked up two acontia, each furnished with its thong. (Hauser thinks that he is sticking one of them into the ground, but this does not seem certain.) The other athlete is not unlike a figure on the cup by Pheidippos in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 6" type="Vase">London E 6</rs>: C. Smith pl. 1, whence Hoppin ii p. 351, N. Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 323 and <title>Athl.</title> fig. 21; <title>AM.</title> 55 pl. 10: <title>ARV</title>. p. 55 no. 10), but the legs are turned the other way, which puzzled Hauser, but see Norman Gardiner (<title>JHS.</title> 27 p. 258). There is no thong on the acontion: the painter probably forgot it.</p>

<p>In the third group, the pair (1-2), the left-hand youth is engaged with his acontion, but his companion holds his at rest, and from his attitude and gesture is evidently giving instruction.<note anchored="true" n="ii.4.1"><p>Not 'raising his hand in astonishment', as Hauser.</p></note> Neither acontion is thonged, and one might have guessed that this was a lecture on general principles, on the importance of getting the thong in exactly the right place, were it not that the thong was omitted in the last group, and that there the omission can hardly have been intentional. Hauser noticed that the instructor wears a wreath like the trainers, whereas the acontists have simple fillets and the wrestlers are bare-headed.</p>

<p>In dealing with the names, it is best to begin with what is certain. In the group 3-5, the acontists are <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*I*L*O*N</foreign> (Philon) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*T*E*A*R*X*O*S</foreign> (Etearchos), the trainer <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*I*M*O*N</foreign> (Simon). There is also a nonsense inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*O*P*P*O*K*I</foreign> between 3 and 4. In the group 1-2, the instructor is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*A*U*L*O[*S]</foreign> (Phayllos), the pupil <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*S*E*N*O*F[*O*N]</foreign> (Xenophon). In the group 6-8, the trainer is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*T*O*I*O*D*O*R*O*S</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ptw|o/dwros</foreign>), the athlete bending <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*O*T*R*A*T*O*S</foreign> (So(s)tratos), the other athlete probably <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*K*R*A*T*E*S</foreign> (E(u)krates). In the wrestling group, 9-12, I take the wrestlers to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*D*E*M*O*S</foreign> (Eudemos) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*O*S*R*A*T*O*S</foreign> (Sos(t)ratos), the trainers to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*G*I*O*A*S</foreign> (Hegias, with the initial <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H</foreign> omitted, as often, and an intrusive omikron — the artist was about to end the word in -os, and realized his mistake too late), and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*I*L*U*K[*O*S]</foreign> (Epilykos).</p>

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>

<p>The name of Phayllos occurs on four vases, all of the same period: (1) on the London amphora <rs key="London E 256" type="Vase">London E 256</rs> (see above) <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*F]*A*U*L*L*O*S</foreign> is about to throw the discus; (2) on our psykter, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*A*U*L*O[*S]</foreign> holds an acontion and is giving instruction in the art of casting it; (3) on an amphora by Euthymides in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2308" type="Vase">Munich 2308</rs>; FR. pl. 81, whence Hoppin i p. 435 and Norman Gardiner <title>Athl.</title> fig. 124: <title>ARV</title>. p. 25 no. 4), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*A*U*L*L*O*S</foreign> is again about to throw <pb xml:id="ii.5" n="5"/> the discus; (4) on the psykter by Euthymides in Turin (<title>JHS.</title> 35 pl. 6, whence Hoppin i p. 437: <title>ARV</title>. p. 25 no. 9), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*A*U*L*L*O*S</foreign> is using the strigil.<note anchored="true" n="ii.5.1"><p>There is perhaps a fifth occurrence, on the fragmentary stamnos by Euphronios in Leipsic (<rs key="Leipsic T 523" type="Vase">Leipsic T 523</rs>: <title>Jb.</title> 11 p. 185, whence Hoppin <title>Euth. and F.</title> pl. 34 and <title>Anz.</title> 1918, Beil. at p. 68: <title>ARV.</title> p. 16 no. 6). A small floating sherd inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*U*L...</foreign> is assigned by Hauser to the picture of Peleus and Thetis on the front, but it might belong to the athletic scene on the back and give the name of the discus-thrower, [Pha]yl[los], with part of his discus.</p></note> Hauser suggested, though very tentatively (<title>Jb</title>. 10 pp. 110-11), and Furtwängler after him (FR. ii, 110-11), that the Phayllos represented on these four vases might be the famous pentathlete of Croton, thrice victorious in the Pythian Games — twice in the pentathlon and once in wrestling — who fought at Salamis in a ship manned by Crotoniates and provided and commanded by himself, the only ship from all Western Greece. It will be noticed that the Phayllos of the vases twice holds a discus, once an acontion; and acontion and discus are two of the 'five events'. The dates fit: supposing our vases to have been painted in 520, and Phayllos to have been 25 at the time, he would have been born in 545, and would have been sixty-five years of age at Salamis, old for a captain, but not too old for a lion-hearted man like Phayllos, especially as he had provided the ship. Moreover, 520 and 25 are outside figures; the vases are probably a little later, and Phayllos need not have been more than twenty when they were painted. Phayllos will have been staying in Athens at the time: perhaps he was in exile, or there may have been another reason.<note anchored="true" n="ii.5.2"><p>As a promising boy Phayllos may have been sent to athletic 'finishing school' at Athens. Not many years later, it will be remembered, the Aeginetan athlete Pytheas, from the famous athletic family of the Psalychiadai, was trained by the Athenian Menandros (<bibl n="Pind. N. 5">Pind.

Pindar was probably writing in 489, and Menandros must have been active for a good while before this, or his successful pupils could not have been reckoned, even with some exaggeration, by the thousand. Any explanation of Phayllos' presence at Athens must naturally be conjectural and does not affect the main contention.</p></note> That Phayllos had some specially close connexion with Athens is shown by the statue of him erected on the Athenian Acropolis.<note anchored="true" n="ii.5.3"><p><title>IG.</title> I 2 655; Tod <title>Greek Historical Inscriptions</title> p. 26 no. 21; <title>Hesp.</title> 8 pp. 156-7 (Raubitschek: but the victories were at the Pythia and Phayllos is not a <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/s</foreign>-name); Raubitschek <title>Dedications from the Athenian Akropolis</title> pp. 80-2 no. 76.

<p>Some of the other names on the psykter occur elsewhere. Sostratos, here shown both as wrestler and as acontist, is mentioned on five other vases of this period, one red-figure, four black-figure: four of the five are cited in <title>ARV</title>. p. 941 : on the fifth, Sostratos himself is represented: it is a fragment of a black-figured vase (pelike?), in the Louvre: a discus-thrower stands to right, bending: he is <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*S*O]*S*T*R*A*T*O*S</foreign>; then comes a flute-player, standing to left; and then an acontist with right leg frontal, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*X*S*A*N]*Q*I*P*P*O*S</foreign>, perhaps the father of Perikles and victor at Mycale. It is conjectured by Raubitschek that the [S]ost[ra]tos son of [P]etalos of an inscribed base from the Acropolis may be ours (<title>Dedications from the Athenian Akropolis</title>, pp. 196-8).</p>

<p>The name of the youth instructed by Phayllos is incomplete: the half-preserved letter seemed to me to be a phi, so the name is Xenophon. Xenophon appears, discus in hand, on a plate by the Cerberus Painter, somewhat earlier than our psykter, in Boston (<rs key="Boston 03.785" type="Vase">Boston 03.785</rs>: Caskey <title>B.</title> pl. 1, 2: <title>ARV</title>. p. 55 no. 1).</p>

<p>Philon is a common name: our Philon may be the same who is praised on a black-figured kyathos in Cambridge (<title>CV.</title> pl. 21, 1: <title>ARV</title>. pp. 939 and 967). An Epilykos is praised on many vases of the period (<title>ARV</title>. p. 922): but if we are right in assigning the name to a bearded trainer (12), he will be another Epilykos, uncle, perhaps, of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/s</foreign>. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*E*D*E*M*O*S</foreign> on an amphora by Euthymides in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2307" type="Vase">Munich 2307</rs>; FR. pl. 14, whence Hoppin 1 p. 433: <title>ARV</title>. p. 24 no. 1) is probably Eudemos misspelt; but again, if we are right in giving the name to a young athlete, the bearded reveller of Euthymides is not the same man.</p>

<p>An athlete Ptoiodoros was grandfather of the Corinthian Xenophon, stadiodromos and pentathlos, for whom Pindar wrote his thirteenth Olympian ode in 464 (see schol. <bibl n="Pind. O. 13">Pind. O. 13.58</bibl>): but it would be rash to suggest that the Corinthian Ptoiodoros is figured on this Attic vase. On the form of the name see Wilamowitz <title>Pindaros</title> p. 369. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ptoio/dwros</foreign>, it is true, is given in our texts, but Phintias may have pronounced it <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ptw|o/dwros</foreign>.</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.6" n="6"/>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A psykter of slightly earlier style, by Oltos, in New York has a similar subject, and alludes to three of the five events in the pentathlon: discus, javelin, and jump (Richter and Hall pl. 4 and pl. 173, 3: <title>ARV</title>. p. 35 no. 6).</p>

<p>The figures are contoured with relief-lines; most of the lips, however, as usual in early archaic red-figure, are without relief. Minor inner markings in brown; wreaths, fillets, thongs, inscriptions in red. Two of the acontia are seen to have metal ferrules, also in red. On these ferrules see Jüthner <emph>Über antike Turngeräthe</emph> p. 38. A red line runs round the vase below the ground-line; three others round the neck. The underside of the foot is profiled, and rests on the outer edge only. The graffito, a sigma and an iota, is wrong in Hauser (<title>Jb.</title> 10 p. 108), right in Hoppin (<title>Euth. and F.</title> p. 129).</p>

<p>On the psykter, its shape and use, see Richter and Milne pp. xxiii and 12-13, and Vanderpool in <title>Hesp.</title> 15 pp. 322-3.</p>

<p>Psykters with figure-decoration range from about 525 to 460; none of the black ones are much later; nor are any of the representations on vases. The last quarter of the sixth century, and the first half of the fifth, that is the period of the psykter: and more attention is paid to it in the earlier part of the period, before the end of the sixth century, than in the later.</p>

<p>Psykters may be divided into two classes: those with 'ears' or string-holes (shaped as rings, loops, or pairs of small tubes — <foreign xml:lang="greek">au)li/skoi</foreign>); and those without. In the former class, of which the Turin psykter by Euthymides is an example, the ears divide the zone, and there are two pictures, one on each side; in the latter, as in our psykter, a single picture runs right round the vase. The black-figure psykters are usually without ears, and most of them are of one model, with a double-torus mouth and a single-torus foot. There are one or two black-figure psykters in which the single-torus foot is accompanied by a single-torus mouth: the Bardini vase, and <rs key="London B 299" type="Vase">London B 299</rs>. This is also the shape of the black psykter in Syracuse (no. A. 24). No red-figure example of this shape is preserved: <rs key="Louvre G 59" type="Vase">Louvre G 59</rs> has the single-torus mouth, but the foot is lost. The Boston psykter by Phintias is a slightly more elaborate version of this type: a small moulding is added below the torus mouth, and another above the torus foot. Other red-figured psykters have this mouth, but a different foot, or this foot, but a different mouth.</p>

The eared psykter, on the other hand, regularly had a lid, of slip-over type: it is often preserved, and where it is now missing it may be inferred from the form of the mouth, which was evidently designed to receive a lid.

It is not clear that the vase served the same purpose as our psykters; and in any case the shape is so different that it must be kept apart from them:</p>

<p>The shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 109. Acquired from Hartwig. Present height (the foot is modern) 0.53; diameter 0.325. Warrior leaving home (youth and woman). Between the two heads, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*U*K[*O]*S</foreign>; lower, downwards, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A[*L]*O[*S]</foreign> (<title>ARV</title>. p. 932, foot). About 500-490 B.C.</p>

<p>The hydria is of the old type commonly used by black-figure painters, with the neck marked sharply off from the shoulder and the shoulder from the body; as opposed to the kalpis-hydria, which came in about 520 and by 480 had almost driven the other out. In detail, our vase is less old-fashioned than the Boston hydria <rs key="Boston 13.200" type="Vase">Boston 13.200</rs> (no. 69). It is slenderer; the body curves less rapidly downwards; the neck does not flare; the back-handle is higher; and there is a distinct incurve at the base. A very rare feature is the lipped mouth; it never occurs in black-figured hydriai, and the only other red-figured hydriai of this type that have it are <rs key="London E 162" type="Vase">London E 162</rs> and <rs key="Madrid 11117" type="Vase">Madrid 11117</rs> (see below).<note anchored="true" n="ii.9.1"><p>Somewhat less uncommon is a mouth with a 'lip' below as well as above: this is found in some early bf. hydriai (e.g. <rs key="Louvre E 735" type="Vase">Louvre E 735</rs>, Pottier pl. 54: <rs key="Louvre F 8" type="Vase">Louvre F 8</rs> (<title>CV.</title> III Hf pl. 60 and pl. 59, 3)), in a bf. hydria by the A.D.

It should be said, however, that although the simple foot is proper to the type, most of the late archaic red-figure examples have a double-ogee foot: such are the following:</p>

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>As to decoration, the earlier red-figured hydriai of black-figure shape follow the system of the black-figured ones, and frame both the picture on the body and the picture on the shoulder: but nearly all the later ones drop the frame, and most of them are decorated 'Nolan-wise' with a couple of figures on the body and none on the shoulder.<note anchored="true" n="ii.10.2"><p>A recent addition to these hydriai is the fragment published in <title>Epit. Tsounta</title> p. 498 pl. 1 and pl. 2, 2: by the Syriskos Painter.</p></note> It is the same change as takes place in the amphora (see <title>Kl.</title> p. 15). Our painter does not go the whole way: the frames have disappeared, but there is a picture on the shoulder as well as one on the body. The Berlin Painter makes the same compromise on his hydriai in Madrid and the Cabinet des Médailles.</p>

<p>The theme of the chief picture is 'the warrior leaving home'. The libation before departure is described in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.220-56">Hom. Il. 16.220-56</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.281">Hom. Il. 24.281</bibl>; <bibl n="Hom. Od. 15.147">Hom. Od. 15.147</bibl>: see Wrede in <title>AM.</title> 41 pp. 260-2), but does not become a favourite subject in vase-painting till the last decades of the sixth century: it remains popular almost to the end of the fifth: see <ref target="ii.77" n="U">ii p. 77</ref>. A young man stands with body and right leg frontal, but facing to right, his head bent, a phiale in his right hand, his spear in his left; his shield is on the ground, leaning against his knee. A woman stands before him, holding out an oinochoe in her right hand, while with a gesture of her left she asks for the phiale to fill. The drawing is precise and minute, in thin fine lines. The parts of the body, at least in the male figure, are not well knit together: there is stiffness: but feeling also: this is a solemn act.</p>

<p>The physical type of the woman, slender and delicate, with thin neck and long face, yet ample breasts, occurs on other vases of the period: for instance in early works of the Berlin Painter, such as his Panathenaic amphora in the Cabinet des Médailles (de Ridder p. 280; B, <title>Berl.</title> pl. 13, 1: <title>ARV</title>. p. 132 no. 6), or on the early Douris cup in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 2283" type="Vase">Berlin 2283</rs>: <title>AZ.</title> 1883 pl. 1, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> i p. 211: <title>ARV</title>. p. 281 no. 19). For the youth, one might compare the Apollo of the Berlin Painter on his Würzburg vase (<rs key="Munich 2312" type="Vase">Munich 2312</rs>; FR. pl. 134, 2; Langlotz pl. 165: <title>ARV</title>. p. 132 no. 7), the discus-thrower on his early Panathenaic in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2310" type="Vase">Munich 2310</rs>; <title>VA.</title> p. 35; <title>Berl.</title> pl. 7, 2: <title>ARV</title>. p. 132 no. 5), the Achilles on his hydria in New York (<rs key="New York 10.210.19" type="Vase">New York 10.210.19</rs>; <title>JHS.</title> 31 pl. 9; <title>Berl.</title> pl. 22, 1; Richter and Hall pl. 16: <title>ARV</title>. p. 140 no. 132). All these for the physical types only, not for the style. I do not know of any other vases by the painter of the Boston hydria: it might perhaps be an 'essay-piece', the work of a very young man doing his best.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The youth wears chitoniskos, corslet, helmet, greaves, has a sword at his side. Only one shoulder-flap is fastened down to the knob or button on the chest. The body of the corslet is covered with small rectangular scales, whether of leather or metal. The left half of the middle is further protected by a flap, covered with small semi-oval scales, no doubt of metal, which is laid on top of the rectangles, but under the shoulder-flap. It is bordered above by a broad band ornamented with a pattern of billets and a line of dots winding between them. A similar flap, one would think, will be laid on the right half of the middle (although one does make out where it can be), and the right-shoulder flap then fastened down over it: see, however, the corslet on the cup by Douris formerly in the Pembroke collection (<title>El.</title> 4 pl. 98: <title>ARV</title>. p. 287 no. 98).</p>

<p>Two rows of pteryges are attached to the belt of the corslet. A corner of the shoulder-piece shows in the region of the right armpit. The caul of the Attic helmet is covered with studs, rendered by raised black dots. Crest, nasal, nape-piece; cheek-pieces, one up, one down (as also on the stamnos by the Berlin Painter in Munich, <rs key="Munich 2406" type="Vase">Munich 2406</rs>, FR. pl. 106, 2, <title>ARV</title>. p. 138 no. 106). The outline of the eye is nowhere open. Eyelashes in brown. The lips are parted. The woman wears a chiton, and a himation of 'Ionic' mode, which passes over the right shoulder; saccos, earrings, bracelets. The inner corner of the dot- <pb xml:id="ii.11" n="11"/>and-circle eye is slightly open. The hair is combed straight down in front and is rendered by relief-lines on a light brown background. The lips are closed and the corner of the mouth drawn down.</p>

<p>The figures are contoured with relief-lines. The brown lines on the chitons and on the thighs of the youth do not come out in the photograph. Red for bracelets, baldric, and inscriptions.</p>

<p>Lykos was a common name, and the Lykos of our inscription need not be the same as the Lykos or Lykoi commemorated on other vases (<title>ARV</title>. pp. 932-3).</p>

<p>On the shoulder of the vase, two lions approach a bull. This is not one of those closely interknit groups of lions and bull that are frequent in archaic art: the animals mutter or roar, but do not touch. The artist probably had in mind the rows of paratactic animals that often fill the predellas, and sometimes the shoulders, of black-figured hydriai. There is a similar group on the neck of the volute-krater by the Syleus Painter in Antioch (<title>JHS.</title> 59 p. 6: <title>ARV</title>. p. 166 no. 24): on the other hand, for the shoulder of his hydria of black-figure shape in the Ferrari collection (<title>Rend. Pont. Acc.</title> 10 p. 205: <title>ARV</title>. p. 166 no. 31) he uses the fully interknit group — lion and lioness attacking a fawn.</p>

<p>The animals have little relief-contour. The belly of the bull, with the elbow of the right foreleg, is restored.</p>

V.</title> p. 111, see below, <ref target="ii.13" n="U">ii p. 13</ref>).</p>

<p>The provenience is uncertain. The museum register gives 'Gela': but adds the word 'Spinelli?' with a query. If the vase really came from the Spinelli collection it is very unlikely to have been found at Gela, or indeed anywhere but at Suessula.</p>

<p>Danae and her child Perseus are to be put into a chest and cast into the sea. The old king of Argos, Akrisios, father of Danae, stands on the left, his right arm extended, the sceptre in his left hand. The carpenter is finishing the chest, using the bow-drill to pierce a hole in the side of the lid. Danae stands behind the chest, and on the right is the nurse, holding the infant Perseus. Danae is turned towards her child, but looks round at the king and makes a last gesture of protest; the nurse makes the same gesture, but more feebly. Akrisios is obdurate: meanwhile Perseus, comfortably ensconced between his nurse's warm mantle and her warm flank, watches the workman with great interest.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the subject the Boston hydria goes with two other vases of the same period, both in Leningrad: the stamnos by the Eucharides Painter (<title>Mon.</title> 1856 pl. 8, whence Cook <title>Zeus</title> iii p. 459; details, <title>VA.</title> p. 47: <title>ARV</title>. p. 155 no. 26), and the calyx-krater by the Triptolemos Painter (Gerhard <title>Danae</title> pl. 1, whence Overbeck <title>KM.</title> pl. 6, 3, J. M. Woodward <title>Perseus</title> pl. 17, Cook <title>Zeus</title> iii p. 457: <title>ARV</title>. p. 239 no. 1): in all three the carpenter is seen at work. The picture on the stamnos, in spite of many differences, is so like ours in the main that the two must be derived from one original.</p>

<p>Caskey, when he published the hydria (<title>MFA. Bull.</title> 12 p. 6), gave the name of Danae to the figure we have called the nurse; in the other woman, our Danae, he saw Eurydike, mother of Danae and wife of Akrisios. The figures corresponding to these two in the stamnos by the Eucharides Painter had been named Danae and Eurydike by Welcker (<title>Annali</title> 1856 p. 37), and this identification has been generally accepted. Cook alone took the other view (<title>Zeus</title> iii p. 458). There is something to be said on both sides: what decided us was the aspect of the woman holding the child on the Boston hydria: with her thin face, bony nose, and weak gesture, she looks old, worn, and humble. It does not follow automatically that the corresponding figure on the Leningrad stamnos is a nurse and not Danae: but it is very probable.</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.12" n="12"/>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The most recent list of vases with the story of Danae and the Chest is given by Greifenhagen in <title>CV.</title> Bonn, p. 37. The Providence lekythos occurs twice in his list, for it is the vase once in Lewes House. Add a fragment, from the Acropolis of Athens, in the collection of Mr. Henri Seyrig: about 425 B.C.: part of Danae to right, and of Perseus to left holding out both arms. The Italiote skyphos <rs key="Naples 3140" type="Vase">Naples 3140</rs> is omitted, perhaps on the ground that the boy might seem rather old to be Perseus (<title>Mus. Borb.</title> 2 pl. 30, 4; <title>V. Pol.</title> p. 73; Trendall <title>Frühit.</title> pl. 17, a and p. 39 no. 10).</p>

<p>Akrisios wears a himation. The workman has let his chitoniskos down to his waist. The women wear chiton and himation; Danae's himation is draped in the 'Ionic' fashion. Acrisios has a fillet round his head, Danae has her hair tied with a long cord. Both carpenter and nurse are wreathed, which is difficult to understand. Wreaths, fillet, and cord are in red. The figures in both pictures are contoured with relief-lines. The hair in front of Danae's ear is in relief-lines on a dark brown background. The wrinkles on the king's forehead do not come out in the photograph. The chest, as in the Eucharides Painter's stamnos and in the smaller version of the same subject on his cup in Ferrara (<rs key="Ferrara T. 503" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 503</rs>: Aurigemma (1) p. 69 = (2) p. 73: <title>ARV</title>. p. 157 no. 63), is of the less common form in which the feet are made separately, instead of being prolongations of the sides as on the calyx-krater by the Triptolemos Painter. On the two types see Massow in <title>AM.</title> 41 pp. 6-10. The mid-panel is ornamented with a pair of roundels and a pair of stars, very likely thought of as inlaid: on such inlay see Massow pp. 20-3 and especially G. and A. Körte <title>Gordion</title> pp. 100-17. The carpenter is using a bow-drill to make a hole in the side of the lid; on the calyx-krater by the Triptolemos Painter, as Campana saw (<title>Bull.</title> 1845 p. 216), he is drilling a hole in the upper side of the chest itself; in the stamnos by the Eucharides Painter he is closing the lid to make sure that it fits. The horizontal line below the right hand of the carpenter is part of the drill-cord. His heel is duly indicated to left of the chest-leg, above the lion-paw foot. The second corner-weight of Danae's himation shows to right of the other chest-leg. The short horizontal stroke below the left forearm of Perseus is the lower line of the nurse's breast.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The carpenter appears, though not at work, on other vases besides the three mentioned. The figure to left of the chest on a bell-krater fragment of about 425 B.C. in Bonn (<rs key="Bonn 1216.53" type="Vase">Bonn 1216.53</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 31, 14) is probably the carpenter, and he certainly appears, about 460 B.C., on the Deepdene Painter's best vase, a stamnos in New York (<rs key="New York 17.230.37" type="Vase">New York 17.230.37</rs>: <title>AJA</title>. 1923 pp. 279-81; Richter and Hall pll. 85-6 and pl. 173, 82: <title>ARV</title>. p. 326 no. 1). According to Miss Richter (Richter and Hall p. 112) the two sides of the New York vase represent successive incidents in the legend of Danae: on A, the reception of the news that Danae is to be exposed, on B the moment before the exposure. It seems to me that there is one scene only, half on one side of the vase and half on the other: such division is common and only one example need be quoted, the Vienna pelike with the Death of Aegisthus (<rs key="Vienna 3725" type="Vase">Vienna 3725</rs>; FR. pl. 72, whence Pfuhl fig. 370). Nor is it clear to me that the servant standing beside Eurydike is the nurse of Perseus rather than a handmaid waiting upon queen Eurydike. As to her gesture, holding her nose, it does not express disgust, but grief hard to master, as in the old father on an amphora by the Dikaios Painter in London (<rs key="London E 254" type="Vase">London E 254</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 2, 2; Hoppin <title>Euth and his Fellows</title> pl. 10, second row, right: <title>ARV</title>. p. 28 no. 3); compare also the old man on the bell-krater by the Caivano Painter in Schwerin (<title>Jb.</title> 29 pl. 6; Trendall <title>Paestan Pottery</title> fig. 52).</p>

<p>Mr. Martin Robertson has kindly sent me a photograph of two fragments, perhaps from a stamnos, in the Villa Ariadne at Cnossos, presumably found in the neighbourhood: they may be part, as he says, of a 'Danae and Perseus'. The smaller sherd gives a piece of the handle-palmettes; the larger, feet and shanks of a woman in a peplos standing to right, and part of a handsome chest, seen in three-quarter view. If the subject was Danae and Perseus, it may have been treated somewhat as in the hydria by the Danae Painter in Boston (<rs key="Boston 03.792" type="Vase">Boston 03.792</rs>: <title>Mon. Piot</title> 10 pl. 8, whence <title>Jh.</title> 12 p. 166; Richter <title>Furn.</title> fig. 223; the shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 111; <title>ARV</title>. p. 666 no. 8). The Cnossos fragments recall the Phiale Painter, and may be his work.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 12. Danae.

<p>On the shoulder of the vase, Theseus binds the bull of Marathon. Its hind-legs and <pb xml:id="ii.13" n="13"/> testicles are roped, and he is roping the fore-legs. Two companions are stationed, one on each side, to head the bull off, spear in the right hand, cloak, in a posture of defence, on the left arm. One kneels or crouches, the other prefers to sit. Similar figures with spears and cloaks appear in other pictures of the same subject: so on a fragmentary cup, of about the same period, by the Ashby Painter, in Florence, Villa Giulia, and Heidelberg (<title>ARV.</title> p. 299 no. 3). In the cup by the Kleophrades Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<title>Kl.</title> pl. 13 and p. 20: <title>ARV</title>. p. 128 no. 92) Athena herself heads the bull off with spear and, instead of a cloak, the aegis on her arm. In other versions the comrades brandish clubs: cup by the Euergides Painter in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 1929.465" type="Vase">Oxford 1929.465</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 53, 1-2: <title>ARV</title>. p. 60 no. 2); cup by the Epeleios Painter in New York (<rs key="New York 06.1021.168" type="Vase">New York 06.1021.168</rs>: <title>Coll. M.E.</title> pl. 11, 247: <title>ARV</title>. p. 111 no. 2, 'related', but it is by the painter himself). The picture of Theseus and the Bull that resembles ours most closely is on the neck of a contemporary volute-krater, by the Tyszkiewicz Painter, in Syracuse (<title>N.Sc.</title> 1891 p. 412: <title>ARV</title>. p. 185 no. 3).</p>

<p>In 1918 I attributed the drawing to the Painter of the Diogenes Amphora (<title>VA.</title> p. 52), but in 1925 I withdrew the attribution, noting the resemblance to the Painter of the Munich Amphora (<title>Att. V.</title> p. 111). In 1943 (<title>ARV</title>. p. 163) I grouped the vase with two others, an amphora then in the Gallatin collection, now in New York (<rs key="New York 41.162.101" type="Vase">New York 41.162.101</rs>: <title>CV.</title> Gallatin pl. 51, 1; A, <title>Bull. Metr.</title> 37 p. 55; A, <title>AJA</title>. 1944 p. 38) and a kalpis-hydria in the Vatican (<title>Mus. Greg.</title> ii pl. 12, 3; Pareti <title>La Tomba Regolini-Galassi</title> pl. 51, 393; phot. Anderson 42068), and called the artist the Gallatin Painter. I added that he was very like the Diogenes Painter and might prove to be after all the same in an earlier phase; at the same time I spoke again of the kinship with the Painter of the Munich Amphora and said that a line beginning with him ran through the Gallatin Painter and the Diogenes Painter right on to the Syleus Painter. I cannot yet go farther than this.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A fragment of a red-figured hydria, black-figure shape, in Mykonos, with Achilles and Polyxena at the fountain, should be added to the list of works by the Gallatin Painter; it also recalls, as is natural, the Diogenes Painter.</p>

<p>The Danae of our vase may be compared with the Athena on a fine column-krater by the Diogenes Painter in Leningrad (<title>Otchët</title> 1899 p. 27 fig. 39; <title>VA.</title> p. 53: <title>ARV</title>. p. 163, below, no. 1): the drawing there is more careful and more sapient, but the style hardly distinguishable.</p>

<p>In shape and proportions the vase does not differ much from late black-figured hydriai. The scheme of decoration too — framed pictures — is traditional. An unusual feature is that the broad band of pattern below the chief picture is replaced by a thin reserved band: the only other red-figured hydriai of black-figure shape in which this is done are those by the Painter of the Munich Amphora, <rs key="Compigne 1054" type="Vase">Compiègne 1054</rs> (<title>CV.</title> pl. 13, 6 and pl. 15, 2-3: <title>ARV</title>. p. 162 no. 10) and <rs key="Berlin 2175" type="Vase">Berlin 2175</rs> (Genick pl. 29; Lücken pl. 42: <title>ARV</title>. p. 162 no. 11). By the time of our vase, the new scheme of decoration with unframed pictures was already being applied to hydriai of the old shape (<ref target="ii.10" n="U">ii p. 10</ref>): the only hydriai of this type, with framed pictures, that are later than ours are a fragment by the Syleus Painter in the possession of Guglielmo de Ferrari (<title>Rend. Pont. Acc.</title> 10 p. 205: <title>ARV</title>. p. 166 no. 31), and <rs key="London E 161" type="Vase">London E 161</rs> by the Syriskos Painter (<title>CV.</title> pl. 71, 1 and pl. 72, 3: <title>ARV</title>. p. 196 no. 20).</p>

<p>The shoulder is flat, the back-handle rounded not ridged, the side-handles well turned up, the base-fillet not pronounced; there is little if any incurve at the base. The sides of mouth and foot are reserved. The ends of the rotelle are red; there is a red line above the rays at the base, and a pair of them below the ground-line.</p>

V.</title> p. 113 no. 1; <title>ARV</title>. p. 185 no. 1). Our drawings are by F. Anderson.</p>

<p>The story of Achilles and Memnon was told in the <title>Aithiopis</title> attributed to Arktinos of Miletus. After the burial of Hector, two great champions came to help the Trojans. First, Penthesilea the Amazon, daughter of Ares; and after her death at the hands of Achilles, Memnon, fairest of men, son of Tithonos (brother of Priam) and of the goddess Eos. Memnon slew Antilochos, who died to save his father Nestor. Then Achilles slew Memnon. Soon after, Achilles himself was slain by Paris.</p>

<p>The two warriors no longer have their spears. Achilles strides forward, sword in hand. Memnon has drawn his sword, but is wounded, and falls. Both warriors are youthful; and a third warrior lies dead at their feet. On the left Athena steps forward to stand by Achilles, her spear in her right hand, her left arm extended in the aegis. On the right, Eos (wingless as often) stretches out her left arm to support her falling son, while her right arm is extended in entreaty. The names are all inscribed: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*A*I*A</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*X*I*L*E*U*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*L*A*N*I*P*P*O*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*I*M*N*O*N</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E*I*O*S</foreign>. Besides, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*A*X*E*A*S</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign> is written on the rim of the dead youth's shield. Lacheas does not appear elsewhere as a kalos-name in this form; but in the true Attic form Laches it recurs on six cups of the late archaic period, all by the Antiphon Painter or in his manner (<title>ARV</title>. p. 929). Whether this Laches is the same as our Lacheas is uncertain.</p>

<p>In most pictures of the subject, the figure of the goddess Eos, mother of Memnon, is answered on the other side by the figure of the goddess Thetis, mother of Achilles. Here Athena takes the place of Thetis; and so, as will be seen, in one or two other pictures.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Again, from what is known of the epic story, one would expect the dead youth to be Antilochos; and Antilochos is the name in two earlier pictures of the combat between Achilles and Memnon (<ref target="ii.15" n="U">ii p. 15</ref>): here, however, the name is Melanippos. Three Trojans of this name make a brief appearance in the <title>Iliad</title>, and one Greek. The Trojans are slain almost as soon as mentioned;<note anchored="true" n="ii.14.1"><p>One of them is slain by Antilochos (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 15.546-84">Hom. Il. 15.546-84</bibl>).</p></note> the Greek remains: but the name is given too freely to supers for one to feel confident that this is the same man. A fifth Melanippos is mentioned by Apollodorus in a list of Priam's bastard sons (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.12.5">Apollod. 3.12.5</bibl>): Robert conjectures that after the death of Antilochos, Memnon encountered this Melanippos, who fled, but was overtaken and slain; and that the combat between Achilles and Memnon took place over the body. He further conjectures that on a red-figured cup by the Brygos Painter in Tarquinia (<title>Mon.</title> 11 pl. 33; <title>WV.</title> D pl. 8, 2 = <title>WV.</title> 1890-1 pl. 8, 2; <title>Corolla Curtius</title> pll. 48-50: <title>ARV</title>. p. 246 no. 4), and on a black-figured cup in Würzburg (<rs key="Wrzburg 419" type="Vase">Würzburg 419</rs>: <title>AZ.</title> 1851 pl. 31; Langlotz pl. 117), the falling warrior is Melanippos not Memnon, who would be the man to right of him.</p>

<p>Robert's theory was opposed by Duhn (<title>D.L.Z.</title> 1892 p. 635) and Lung (<title>Memnon</title> pp. 46-8). Robert had assumed the fallen warrior to be a Trojan: Lung pointed out that from the position of the body it was more likely a Greek. True, Lung's rule (ibid. pp. 38-40) that the dead must always lie with his head towards his friends,<note anchored="true" n="ii.14.2"><p>The same rule is stated by Picard and La Coste-Messelière (<title>Fouilles de Delphes</title> iv p. 110), who describe it as 'a matter of elementary, hardly conventional logic'. On the other hand, Lucretius says that 'omnes plerumque cadunt in vulnus' (4, 1049) and other ancient writers speak in similar terms (see Munro's note).
</p>
<p>The fallen warrior on the east side of the Siphnian frieze has his head turned towards the Trojans: therefore, according to Picard and La Coste-Messelière, he must be a Trojan, and thus cannot be Patroklos: but on the Oltos cup in Berlin (quoted above) the fallen warrior has his head turned toward the Trojans, and yet is inscribed Patroklos. If the identification of the Siphnian warrior is doubtful, it is because he is armed instead of being naked.</p></note><note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 14, note 2: Mastrokostas has shown (<title>AM</title>. 71 pp. 74-76) that the fallen warrior on the Siphnian frieze is Sarpedon.</p></note> is not without exceptions: one example is on the East-Greek Euphorbos plate, which Lung himself quotes, in the British Museum (Pfuhl fig. 117), another on the black-figured kantharos <pb xml:id="ii.15" n="15"/> by 'the metic' in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 2134" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 2134</rs>: Graef pl. 94), a third on the black-figured amphora <rs key="Louvre E 732" type="Vase">Louvre E 732</rs> (<title>Mon.</title> 6-7 pl. 7-8), a fourth on the black-figured calyx-krater by Exekias in Athens (North Slope: <title>Hesp.</title> 6 pp. 468-86), a fifth on the red-figured cup by Oltos in Berlin (<title>WV.</title> D pl. 2, 1-2, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> ii p. 249: <title>ARV</title>. p. 38 no. 48); in the last two it is Patroklos who lies with his head towards the enemy. If the dead on the Boston vase is a Greek, we may suppose either, with Lung, that the name Melanippos is a slip for Antilochos, or that the artist has selected a more obscure figure from Memnon's aristeia, which must have included several victims besides Antilochos. The second alternative cannot be rejected out of hand.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>As to the fallen man on the Tarquinia cup, he is certainly an opponent of the warrior who advances from the left; and if this is Achilles, the fallen must be of the Trojan party, whether Memnon or another;<note anchored="true" n="ii.15.1"><p>Hampe takes the fallen man to be Memnon, and the warrior defending him to be perhaps Paris (<title>Corolla Curtius</title> p. 146).</p></note> the same is true of the falling warrior on the Würzburg cup.</p>

<p>The combat of Achilles and Memnon was represented on the Chest of Cypselus: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)Axillei= de\ kai\ *Me/mnoni maxome/nois paresth/kasin ai( mhte/res</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 5.19.1">Paus. 5.19.1</bibl>); and later on the Throne of Apollo at Amyklai (<bibl n="Paus. 3.18.12">Paus. 3.18.12</bibl>), whether in the presence of their mothers is not stated. There are many pictures of the combat on vases, and in some of them the names of the persons are inscribed. We give a list of the inscribed vases first.</p>

What <pb xml:id="ii.16" n="16"/> remains is part of Memnon's corslet, from not far below the neck to the waist, seen from behind, with a piece of the baldric, and the left hand of Eos; to right of the corslet, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*M[*N*O*N]</foreign>. The design, so far as it goes, is just as in the Boston vase.</item>

Achilles, and Memnon, who wears a sleeved and trousered Oriental costume under his chitoniskos and corslet; between them, Athena; behind Achilles, a female holding a fillet (Thetis?); behind Memnon, two warriors, one of whom seems to come to his assistance. The vase is much restored. The inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*X*I*L*L*E*U*S</foreign> remains, and the name of Memnon may have been in the missing part. The treatment is unusual, and Lung denied that the subject could be Achilles and Memnon, but it can hardly be Achilles and an Amazon, as he suggested, because of the warriors on the right. The date is about 465 or 460. This is the earliest representation of Memnon in which he wears Oriental or semi-Oriental costume. It has been conjectured that in the Memnon trilogy of Aeschylus he was so dressed (see Robert <title>Heldensage</title> p. 1183): this is likely enough, although it is nowhere stated: all that is known is that Aeschylus (it is not said where) described the mother of Memnon as a Kissian (<bibl n="Strab. 15.3.2">Strab. 15.3.2</bibl>), that is to say, a native of Susa, so a Persian: an odd description, but serving to show that in Aeschylus Memnon was connected with Susa — came from there, we may say. Susa is the city of Memnon to Herodotus, and had doubtless been so to Aeschylus.</item></list>

<item>The next vase on which Memnon is given semi-Oriental costume is a column-krater from about the middle of the fifth century in Copenhagen, by the Painter of London E 489 (<rs key="Copenhagen 147" type="Vase">Copenhagen 147</rs>: Millingen <title>AUM.</title> 1 pl. 40, whence Overbeck <title>Gall. her.

The subject is not the combat with Achilles, but Memnon setting out, with two companions, one mounted, one on foot. The picture has now been transformed by cleaning, and I publish it in <title>AJA.</title> 1950 pp. 318-19 with fig. 5.

<item>A fragment of a black-figured vase in Athens, <rs key="Athens, Acr. 586" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 586</rs> (<title>Hesp.</title> 13 pl. 7, 2), if it represents the battle between Achilles and Memnon, is a very early Attic rendering of the subject, for the style is related to Sophilos (ibid. p. 52, above, no. 1). The right arm of a warrior holding a spear is preserved, and the upper part of a woman behind him with forearms extended. The woman's name begins with <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H</foreign>, which suggests <pb xml:id="ii.17" n="17"/> H[eos]; the name of the warrior begins with <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M</foreign>; the two letters following the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M</foreign> are damaged: the first of them might be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E</foreign>, but I was not sure that the second, and last preserved, could be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M</foreign>, and for this reason I have not placed the fragment at the head of the Attic list.</item></list></item></list>
<p>Lastly, the names are also inscribed on an Etruscan mirror in New York (<rs key="New York 22.139.84" type="Vase">New York 22.139.84</rs>: <title>Bull. Metr.</title> 1926 p. 83 fig. 6; Richter <title>Handbook of the Etruscan Collection</title> fig. 132): <title>Memnun</title>, attacked by <title>Achle</title>, falls, and is supported by his winged mother. I asked Miss Richter if there were traces of the name Thesan: she reports that there may possibly be traces of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O[*E]*S*A*N</foreign> but that it is extremely doubtful.</p>

<p>We now turn to the uninscribed pictures. Many of the Attic black-figured pictures in which the two combatants are flanked by two female figures must represent Achilles and Memnon in the presence of Thetis and Eos: but that this need not always be the subject is shown by fragments of a black-figured column-krater in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 646" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 646</rs>: see below, <ref target="ii.19" n="U">ii p. 19</ref>) in which the right-hand combatant is inscribed <title>Aineas</title>; his opponent is doubtless Diomed, and the females Athena and Aphrodite. There, however, Aphrodite holds a flower, which would be sufficient, if there were no inscriptions, to show that she was not Eos.<note anchored="true" n="ii.17.1"><p>Aphrodite holds a flower in a later battle-picture, the fight between Menelaos and Paris on the cup by Douris in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 115" type="Vase">Louvre G 115</rs>: <title>WV.</title> 6 pl. 7; Pottier pl. 108, middle: Johansen <title>Il</title>. fig. 40: <title>ARV.</title> p. 285 no. 70).</p></note> If there is no distinguishing mark like the flower, there is a strong probability that the subject is Achilles and Memnon.<note anchored="true" n="ii.17.2"><p>In the bf. dinos <rs key="Vienna, Oest. Mus., 235" type="Vase">Vienna, Oest. Mus., 235</rs>, described by Masner in his catalogue, pp. 29-30, the proximity of the Psychostasia is a special reason for supposing the combatants to be Achilles and Memnon.
</p>
<p>Besides pictures on vases, there is the relief on a clay arula, from Locri, in Reggio (<title>Anz.</title> 1941 p. 658 fig. 135), East Greek style from the later part of the sixth century.
</p>
<p>In stone sculpture, a fragment of a frieze from the great Temple in Corfu is thought to be from a representation of Memnon and Achilles (Rodenwaldt <title>Korkyra</title> pll. 3-4 and pp. 114 and 116-17).</p></note> The black-figure pictures are conventional, the goddesses standing bolt upright, encouraging their sons, only occasionally raising their arms in excitement. It is exceptional when on a later black-figured hydria, by the Rycroft Painter, in Munich, Eos rushes forward with a gesture of despair, as on red-figure vases (<rs key="Munich 1720" type="Vase">Munich 1720</rs>: J. 138: Gerhard <title>A.V.</title> pl. 211-12, 1-2: <title>JHS.</title> 54, p. 91). The Eos of the inscribed onos (<ref target="ii.15" n="U">ii p. 15</ref>), which is very late black-figure, is also like red-figure. We give no list of these black-figured pictures: many of them are in Lung's lists (<title>Memnon</title> pp. 34-6); see also Lippold in <title>Münchener arch. Studien</title> pp. 432-5, Rodenwaldt <title>Korkyra</title> pp. 113 ff., and Foti in <title>Arti figurative</title> 3 (1947) pp. 108-11.</p>

<p>The earliest picture of two warriors fighting, flanked by female figures, is on a Melian vase of the seventh century in Athens (Conze <title>Melische Thongefässe</title> pl. 3; <title>Jb.</title> 53 p. 105). The female figures cannot be separated in subject from the combatants: these may be Achilles and Memnon; but the suit of armour between them is a difficulty: see Nierhaus in <title>Jb.</title> 53 pp. 111-14.</p>

<p>The red-figure pictures of Achilles and Memnon have more character than the majority of the black-figure, and we give a list of those not mentioned above:</p>
<list type="simple">
<item>Freiburg, Goettingen, and Halle, fragments of a rf. cup, from Orvieto. Briefly described in <title>C.F.</title> p. 33 no. 9 bis. I have no doubt that the subject is the conflict between Achilles and Memnon. One of the two Freiburg fragments gives Memnon, to right, looking round, seen from behind, down on one knee, his right arm raised holding the spear, the shield on the left arm. On the right, the right arm of Eos, extended, and one flying end of her Ionic himation: she was running to right, looking round. All that remains of Achilles is the fingers of his left hand, apparently grasping Memnon's spear, and a piece of his left shin. A small fragment in Goettingen joins the Freiburg fragment one the left, adding the left foot of Achilles, with half the shank and the left foot of Memnon. A second fragment in Freiburg has the upper part of Thetis, running to left, looking round, her right hand raised, her left arm extended. A larger fragment in Halle comes from the other half of the exterior; it shows a young archer running to left, leading a horse, and, on the right, a woman running to right, looking round, her right arm extended: she wears boots, which are perhaps winged: Iris?<pb xml:id="ii.18" n="18"/>

<p>Was there an 'Achilles and Memnon' by the Kleophrades Painter? The grandest picture of the Psychostasia, the weighing of the psychai of Memnon and Achilles, is by him, on fragments of a volute-krater in the Cabinet des Médailles (<title>Mon.</title> 2 pl. 10, b; <title>Kleophr.</title> pl. 2 and pl. 30, 6: <title>ARV</title>. p. 124, no. 43, and p. 127 no. 80). Now Luynes, to whom the fragments belonged, mentions fragments of a picture on the reverse, representing a 'combat of gods', 'perhaps the combat between Achilles and Hector' (<title>Annali</title> 1834 p. 296). These fragments were never reproduced and have disappeared: may they not have represented, rather than Achilles and Hector, Achilles and Memnon?</p>

<p>Memnon and his negro henchmen appear on several vases;<note anchored="true" n="ii.18.1"><p>In early literature and art, Memnon is not represented as a negro, but Virgil has 'nigri Memnonis arma' (<bibl><title>Aen.</title> 1, 489</bibl>) and Manilius 'Auroraeque nigrum partum' (<bibl><title>Astr.</title> 1, 767</bibl>). Of course one might be 'niger' (as 'black' in Shakespeare's time, or even in ours) without being a negro: 'quamuis ille niger, quamuis tu candidus esses.'
</p>
<p>In the elder <bibl>Philostratus (<title>Imagines</title> 1, 7, 2</bibl>) Memnon is not quite black, but very nearly.</p></note> the henchmen appear alone on others, and two vases show them in conflict with Greeks. On a black-figured <pb xml:id="ii.19" n="19"/> amphora by Exekias in Philadelphia (<rs key="Philadelphia MS3442" type="Vase">Philadelphia MS3442</rs>; <title>Museum Journal</title> 6 pp. 91-2; <title>AJA.</title> 1935 pl. 8; Technau <title>Exekias</title> pl. 23), Greeks chase them from the dead body of Antilochos. All that remains of the other vase, red-figured, by the Berlin Painter (<title>ARV</title>. p. 131 no. 4), is two fragments in Erlangen (<rs key="Erlangen 526" type="Vase">Erlangen 526</rs>: <title>Mü. Jb.</title> 1919 = Buschor <title>Krokodil des Sotades</title> pl. 3, whence <title>AJA</title> 1935 pl. 9). On all this see Buschor <title>Krok.</title> pp. 36-9. The Erlangen fragments are described more accurately there than in <title>ARV</title>. Add that they are from a loutrophoros rather than a pointed amphora: below the main picture part of a horseman, in silhouette, is preserved: this is probably from the cavalcade at a funeral, and he makes the gesture of valediction. The fragment <rs key="Tbingen E 101" type="Vase">Tübingen E 101</rs> (Watzinger pl. 29: warriors), which is probably from the neck of a loutrophoros, is either by the Berlin Painter or in his manner.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>We return to the Boston krater.</p>

<p>B. The subject on the other side of the vase is taken from the fifth book of the <title>Iliad</title>. Diomed strikes at Aeneas with his spear. Aeneas has drawn his sword, but falls, helpless. Athena encourages Diomed, and Aphrodite comes to the rescue of her son. The figures are all named, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*A*I*A</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L?*I*O*M*E*L?*E*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*N*E*A*S</foreign>, and, retrograde, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*F*R*O*L?*I*T*E</foreign>. The artist has not kept close to Homer: in the <title>Iliad</title>, Diomed wounds Aeneas with a boulder; here he uses his spear. Similarly, in the Kleophrades Painter's version of this scene, on his cup in London (see below), Aeneas is wounded by a spear which still sticks, broken, in the wound, and Diomed is following his attack up with the sword.</p>

<p>Johansen observes (<title>Iliaden</title> p. 112) that the composition of the picture is especially like that of the 'Ajax and Hector' on a cup by Douris in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 115" type="Vase">Louvre G 115</rs>: Hoppin i p. 245; Johansen fig. 39: <title>ARV</title>. p. 285 no. 70).</p>

<p>A third-century Etruscan mirror in Tarquinia (Gerhard <title>E.S.</title>, suppl., pl. 112, 1) is supposed to represent Diomed, Aeneas, and Aphrodite, but the interpretation is uncertain.</p></note></p>

<p>Let us now look at the two pictures in detail. Achilles wears chitoniskos, leather corslet, greaves, Attic helmet with nasal, and with movable cheek-pieces, which are raised. The corslet has pteryges, and the middle part of it is strengthened with metal scales; on one shoulder-flap a lion, on the other a lioness, in black. What is seen below the lioness's belly is the end of a lock of Achilles' hair. The baldric is in red. The shield is of 'Boeotian' type; the inside is browned. The drawing omits inner markings on the legs, and the heart of the black palmette on the helmet. Memnon's mouth is open, and the upper part of the cornea is concealed by the eyelid. He is dressed like Achilles, but has no greaves. The middle of the corslet is imbricated instead of scaled; the shoulder-piece is covered with scales alternately black and reserved, and is unusually ornate, for the nape-piece and the lower corners are in the form of panther's heads. Part of the left corner-panther is seen to right of the shield. The scabbard also ends in the head of a panther. The cheek-piece of the helmet is ornamented with the figure of a lizard, and the part over the forehead is decorated with an imitation of human forehead-hair, as often in actual helmets and in representations of them (see Hauser in <title>Jh</title>. 9 pp. 96-9). The top of the crest is cut off by the upper border, whereas the crests of Achilles and Athena overlap on to it. The device on the shield is a gorgoneion in outline, with black hair and red tongue. The head of the gorgon is surrounded by a black ring and then by a brown one, which is set with snakes. The brown ring is edged with incised lines. The shield-device of Athena on a fragment by the same painter in Athens is very like this (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 812" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 812</rs>: Langlotz pl. 73: <title>ARV</title>. p. 188 no. 60).</p>

<p>It is perhaps more than a coincidence that in an earlier picture of this combat, on a cup by Epiktetos in the Villa Giulia (see <ref target="ii.18" n="U">ii p. 18</ref>), not only does Memnon bear a gorgoneion on his shield as here, but his nape-piece is decorated with a panther-head; the lower corners of the shoulder-piece are plain, but there are panther-heads on the shoulder-flaps of Achilles.<note anchored="true" n="ii.20.2"><p>In the Vivenzio hydria by the Kleophrades Painter (<rs key="Naples 2422" type="Vase">Naples 2422</rs>; FR. pl. 34, whence Pfuhl fig. 378 and <title>Kl.</title> pl. 27: <title>ARV.</title> p. 126 no. 66), Neoptolemos has panther heads on the shoulder-piece of his corslet, but higher up: see Furtwängler in FR. i p. 183.

<p>Antilochos, with wounds in side, nape, and left thigh, lies with the right leg contracted and extended frontal. He has no corslet, only a chitoniskos, with kolpos; his Corinthian helmet has fallen off, and the crest droops, but the skirt of the chiton, instead of hanging down, sticks straight out as if it were made of metal foil. The hair is rolled round a cord at the nape.</p>

<p>I do not recall another vase in which the helmet is seen, fallen off, beside the head of the fallen warrior. But a helmet is shown falling, on a column-krater in Bologna (<rs key="Bologna 192" type="Vase">Bologna 192</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 28, 4-5), and apparently on a Boeotian red-figured kantharos in Athens (<rs key="Athens 12486" type="Vase">Athens 12486</rs>: <title>AM.</title> 65 pl. 20, 1); fallen, on the volute-krater by the Geneva Painter in Geneva (<rs key="Geneva MF 238" type="Vase">Geneva MF 238</rs>; FR. ii p. 314 fig. 105: <title>ARV</title>. p. 430 no. 1), on a hydria by the Leningrad Painter in London (<rs key="London E 167" type="Vase">London E 167</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 73, 1 and pl. 79, 1: <title>ARV</title>. p. 376 no. 63), on a fragment of a volute-krater in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 1922.209" type="Vase">Oxford 1922.209</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 50, 27; the fragment <rs key="New York 23.160.64" type="Vase">New York 23.160.64</rs> might be from the same vase); on Etruscan black-figured vases — the amphora <rs key="Wrzburg 799" type="Vase">Würzburg 799</rs> (<title>Jh.</title> 13 pll. 5-8: Langlotz pll. 232-4: <title>EVP.</title> pp. 17-18), the hydria Naples 2781 (<title>Jh.</title> 13 p. 157: <title>EVP.</title> p. 18). In the right half of the east pediment of the Temple of Aphaia, Aegina, the squire is thought to be holding his master's helmet — catching it when it has slipped <pb xml:id="ii.21" n="21"/>off the head, or having retrieved it from the ground (Furtwängler <title>Aigina</title> pp. 248-9). On a cup by the Panaitios Painter in Boston (<ref target="ii.27" n="U">ii p. 27</ref> and Pl. XXXIX) the helmet seems to be slipping from the warrior's head as he falls; and it is about to fall off on an Etruscan black-figured neck-amphora in the Paris market (Kalebdjian), the style of which recalls the neck-amphora <rs key="Chiusi 577" type="Vase">Chiusi 577</rs> (phots. Alinari 37482-3, whence, A, <title>ML.</title> 30 p. 495, A, Giglioli <title>L'arte etrusca</title> pl. 130, 2: <title>EVP.</title> pp. 18 and 296). The motive occurs in Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.793">Hom. Il. 16.793</bibl>).</p>

<p>Athena wears a thick chiton, a himation of 'Ionic' fashion, the aegis, and an Attic helmet with a frontlet but neither nasal nor cheek-pieces. The gorgoneion is a reduced version of that on Memnon's shield; red tongues, no fangs. The chiton, with its bands of pattern, may be compared with the less elaborate one worn by Athena on the painter's hydria in London (<rs key="London E 165" type="Vase">London E 165</rs>: <title>El.</title> 1 pl. 3; <title>CV.</title> pl. 71, 3 and pl. 72, 4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 188 no. 54) and the more elaborate worn by her on his fragment in Athens already quoted (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 812" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 812</rs>: Langlotz pl. 73). The eyelids are bordered with brown.</p>

<p>Thetis wears a chiton with two kolpoi, and a himation shawl-wise. Her front-hair is tucked behind the stephane and rolled round it behind.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The three shields, close together, bulk large in the composition, and make one think of battle-scenes on black-figure vases of the second quarter and middle of the sixth century, in which the three shields are even more prominent: for example the Louvre hydria, <rs key="Louvre F 6" type="Vase">Louvre F 6</rs> (Pottier pl. 63; <title>CV.</title> III He pl. 59, 1-2), the Munich hydria, <rs key="Munich 1680" type="Vase">Munich 1680</rs> by the same hand (Rumpf <title>Sakonides</title> pl. 13, b), an ovoid neck-amphora in the Villa Giulia which is close to them (Mingazzini <title>Vasi Cast.</title> pl. 57, 3 and pl. 58, 1), or the Louvre hydria, <title>Louvre E 735</title> (Pottier pl. 54).</p>

<p>Diomed wears chitoniskos, leather corslet with scales, Corinthian helmet, but no greaves; there is a star on his left shoulder-flap, but the painter forgot to add the other. Aeneas wears chitoniskos, corslet with imbrications, Attic helmet with nasal and movable cheek-pieces, baldric with scabbard. His corslet has only one row of pteryges. On each shoulder-flap a star. The sword, of a different type from Memnon's, is of the sabre (kopis) form with uneven blade and handle in the form of a swan's head and neck (see <title>British Museum: Guide ... Greek and Roman Life</title> 3 p. 94, and Wrede in <title>AM.</title> 41 p. 245). Athena wears the same costume as on the obverse, but plainer; the chiton is of thinner material and is unornamented, the himation has no border, only an edging of brown, and the aegis lacks the gorgoneion; the helmet is of the same type, but the crest is low ('sessile'), instead of high. Aphrodite wears chiton, himation shawl-wise, stephane with the hair in a krobylos. At each handle, plant-palmettes.</p>

<p>The painter's <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*N*E*A*S</foreign> may be either <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ai)nei/as</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ai)ne/as</foreign>, but <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ai)ne/as</foreign> is the Attic (and the original) form (Wackernagel, <title>Sprachliche Untersuchungen zu Homer</title> p. 2).</p>

<p>Relief-lines are used for the contours. Brown inner markings on the bodies in A though not in B; and brown is used for other details. Red for blood, baldrics, inscriptions, and for the tongues of the gorgons.</p>

<p>'This is the masterpiece', as I have said before (<title>VA.</title> p. 55), 'of a mediocre painter: yet size, shape, and composition make it an imposing thing; and in the sturdy, bull-like fighters there is Homeric vigour, the Homeric of the eleventh book of the Iliad.'</p>

<p>The only additions to the list of the painter's works in <title>ARV.</title> pp. 185-9 and 954 are a neck-amphora with triple handles in Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery (<rs key="Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery 48.58" type="Vase">Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery 48.58</rs>) (A, man; B, woman), a pelike-fragment in the Louvre (lower part of a male in a himation leaning on his stick to right, and the foot, I think, of a person facing him), and another Louvre fragment, which may be from the same vase as the last (upper part of a man leaning on his stick to left).

<p>Formerly in the Bourguignon collection at Naples. Diameter 0.23. Hartwig pl. 10. I, warriors; A, fight. B, youths and horses. By the Eleusis Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 210 no. 6); see also <title>Gnomon</title> 7 p. 328 (Langlotz).</p><pb xml:id="ii.22" n="22"/>
<p>Inside, a large picture (see <ref target="ii.23" n="U">ii p. 23</ref>) two warriors, one armed with spear and shield, the other an archer. Both crouch in the same attitude, with the right leg drawn back, and the left set forward. The feet, except the left foot of the archer, hardly touch the ground. The pair are to be thought of as stealing forward, exposing as little of themselves as possible, the archer with the arrow already on the string. It is not always easy to be sure whether such figures are moving or lodged. On a contemporary cup by the Colmar Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London 97.10-28.1" type="Vase">London 97.10-28.1</rs>: <title>JHS.</title> 41 pl. 3, ii, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 227 no. 9) some of the warriors may be lodged, but others are moving forward: the alternation is natural in such operations. On the cup by the same artist in New York (<rs key="New York 14.105.9" type="Vase">New York 14.105.9</rs>: Richter and Hall pl. 36, 7) the warriors seem to be lodged, but the athlete inside, though not much different in attitude, is in movement. In the forest-fighting on the cup by the Eucharides Painter in Cambridge (<title>CV.</title> ii R and S. pl. 7, I, pl. 8, 8, and pl. 9, 7) the helmeted youths are probably moving forward like their opponents.</p>

<p>The backs of both men are seen in three-quarter view from behind. The spearman wears a helmet (of Attic type, and the cheek-pieces in one with the rest), but neither corslet nor greaves, only a short garment tied round his waist. The archer is dressed in a sleeved and trousered costume, with a felt tiara; his quiver hangs at his side. The triangle bounded by the left thigh of the spearman, by the rim of his shield, and by a triangle of black background, is from the upper part of the quiver; a piece of the lid is visible lower down. The outline of the long eyes is closed in front. The spearman has brown lashes and a brown beard. His lips are parted, the archer's not.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A, battle. A naked warrior is wounded and falls. His left leg is shown in profile; the right thigh is seen from the front, with the shank doubled up behind it and almost concealed. The right foot is seen from behind: the heel remains (with two creases on it), one ankle, and part of the extended sole. The foot and the lower part of the shank rest on a rock, or at least are near a rock: the upper part of the figure is missing, and one cannot be certain whether it was shown as fallen or, as is more likely, still falling. On the right, a warrior advances to left. Here also the upper part of the figure is missing: one sees bare legs, a short garment tied round the waist, the end of the crest, and the lower edge of the shield held out in front. This spearman, as he must be, is followed by a young archer, who draws his bow. Like the spearman, he is shown in three-quarter view from behind. He wears the same costume as the archer on the interior. The garment is here seen to be a combination. His lips are slightly parted. He is supple and light on his feet. On the left of the picture another warrior advances to defend the wounded man. Only his feet are preserved, and the front of the left foot is hidden by the rock.</p>

<p>B is not connected in subject with A. Two horses are being led up to a pillar or post. One horse already stands quiet at the post, held by a youth (or man) who wears a thick woollen cloak of Thracian taste with bold 'blanket' patterns. He is seen from behind, his left leg in profile, his right in full back-view; the ankles are even more prominent than in the fallen figure on A. A second youth hastens up to left, looking round, holding his horse by the lead with both hands, the right hand raised above his head. The hindquarters of the horse are in back-view, the rest of it more or less in profile: an audacious attempt, in the manner of the later archaic period, to reproduce a twisted attitude. The animal had already started to turn towards the post when it changed its mind and decided to resist, which it does with tossed head, open mouth, and flourished tail. The contrast between the two animals reminds one of the quiet and the obstreperous cow in the frieze of the Parthenon. The back-views of horses likest ours are perhaps those on two black-figured lekythoi by the Marathon Painter, <rs key="Syracuse 14569" type="Vase">Syracuse 14569</rs> (Haspels <title>ABL.</title> pl. 30, 1, with p. 222 no. 22) and <rs key="Rhodes 5108" type="Vase">Rhodes 5108</rs> (see ibid. p. 90 and p. 222 no. 30), and another, by the Beldam Painter, in the collection of Mrs. William Moore, New York (Hartwig p. 110: Haspels <title>ABL.</title> p. 177, p. 190, p. 266 no. 10). Compare also the centaurs quoted by Hartwig (pp. 109-10: <title>ARV.</title> p. 165 no. 5, p. 351 no. 5, p. 709, below, no. 21; the lekythos he mentions is that in Syracuse).</p>

<p>The youth wears a spotted cloak, fastened at the pit of the neck, shoes, and a felt or skin cap of foreign type, tiara or the like, with flaps.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The contours are in relief-lines. Brown inner markings on some of the bodies but not <pb xml:id="ii.23" n="23"/> all. There are a few brown interfolds in the garment of the spearman on A. Brown lines on the anus of the back-view horse on B and on the furrow of his scrotum. Red for bowstrings, baldric, leash, inscriptions. On I, ?<foreign xml:lang="greek">[*L*E*A*G*R]*O*S</foreign>, retr., on the right, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, retr., on the left. On the right of B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*L]*E*A*G*R*O*S</foreign>. There may have been a <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalo/s</foreign> on the missing part.</p>

<p>The date of this vivid work is probably a little before 500. After various approximations (<title>VA.</title> p. 87; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 166 no. 3; <title>CF.</title> p. 33 on no. 9) I attributed it in <title>ARV.</title> (p. 210 no. 6) to the Eleusis Painter, named after two fragmentary white cups in Eleusis, one of which is particularly close to the Boston cup (<title>Delt.</title> 9 p. 16: <title>ARV.</title> p. 209 no. 5). The scene on B of our cup recalls the cup-fragments <rs key="Louvre G 26" type="Vase">Louvre G 26</rs> and <rs key="Louvre G 26 bis" type="Vase">Louvre G 26 bis</rs> (<title>ARV.</title> p. 210), which bear the kalos-name Leagros and are related to the Eleusis Painter in style. The larger fragment (Pottier pl. 90) shows one of the ways in which the incomplete pillar or post may have ended above. The other, <rs key="Louvre G 26 bis" type="Vase">Louvre G 26 bis</rs>, unpublished, has been augmented by Villard with a sherd giving the head of the haggard-eyed horse. Another Louvre fragment joins the larger fragment and gives more of the horse on the right.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B. The foot-plate is missing.</p>

<p>No. 2 in the list of vases by the Eleusis Painter (<title>ARV.</title> pp. 209-10, 925, and 955) is now published in <title>CV.</title> Vienna University, pl. 10, 1-4 and 7. The cup-fragment <rs key="Athens, Agora 9052" type="Vase">Athens, Agora 9052</rs>, associated with him in <title>ARV.</title> p. 210, may be early work by the painter himself.</p>

<head>72. <rs key="Boston 98.876" type="vase">98.876</rs> <rs type="shape">CUP</rs> <ref type="plate" n="U">PLATE XXXVII</ref></head>
<p>Formerly in Hartwig's possession. Diameter 0.233, height 0.0821. I, <title>Handbook B.M.F.A.</title> p. 86; the shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 205 no. 159. I, jumper; A-B, athletes. At first I thought this cup might be a very early work by the Panaitios Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 87; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 166 no. 11), but later I detached it from him and placed it in the 'Proto-Panaitian Group' (<title>ARV.</title> p. 211 no. 9). See also <title>Gnomon</title> 4 p. 327 (Langlotz).</p>

<p>The foot of the cup is of type C, but this foot is not accompanied, as it more commonly is, by an offset lip.</p>

<p>The picture inside is large: that is to say, unusually large in proportion to the whole interior space: this is often so in cups of the Proto-Panaitian Group or by the Panaitios Painter: for instance in our nos. 73, 74, 75, and 76 as well as in the cup by the Eleusis Painter, no. 71.</p>

<p>I, an athlete runs, with a halt&emacr;r in each hand. Since he is looking back, he is not about to jump, but hastening to the field. Behind him, a pair of acontia. The composition is a good example of the whirligig which is a favourite in early cup-tondi. Inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*O*D*O*T*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>In the maeander-borders inside cups, it is usually possible to say at what point the artist began: here he seems to have begun 'East', and worked round to 'North, West, South' and back to 'East': at least there is a cramped maeander — the last one — at the <pb xml:id="ii.24" n="24"/> level of the halt&emacr;r in the left hand: I call a defective unit like this the 'odd man' and shall point to other examples.</p>

<p>On A, in the middle, an athlete runs to left, looking back at another who follows him with a pick in his hand ready to loosen the ground. On the left of the picture a third athlete bends, in his left hand an acontion, as if he had just picked it up, in his right the thong. Another acontion stands behind him. Under the right handle there is a pick. Inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>On B, in the middle, an athlete, holding an acontion in each hand like the corresponding figure on A, runs to right, looking back at a companion who follows him with a pair of acontia. Behind them, a pick, and another pair of acontia. On the right, a third athlete runs to left holding a pair of halt&emacr;res in his left hand and raising his right hand with a gesture that seems to say 'Here I come'. Inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S *H*O*P*A*I*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Outside as inside the young men are running to the sports ground. It is early morning.</p>

<p>The drawing is contoured with thick relief-lines. Brown inner markings. The furrow of the hip is sometimes given by a relief-line, sometimes by a brown. One athlete wears a fillet, the rest wreaths of large leaves or small: these, like the inscriptions, are in red.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The cup was probably painted before the end of the sixth century. It belongs to the Proto-Panaitian Group (<title>ARV.</title> p. 211 no. 9), but is not very like any other member of it. It comes closest, perhaps, to the Leagros cup in London (<rs key="London E 46" type="Vase">London E 46</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 210, foot, no. 1), but is far inferior: the drawing lacks subtlety, and is distinctly academic. Both cups stem, one might say, from such earlier work as the komos of the volute-krater by Euphronios in Arezzo (<rs key="Arezzo 1465" type="Vase">Arezzo 1465</rs>; FR. pll. 61-2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 16 no. 5) and the fragmentary cup with the signature of Euphronios in Berlin and the Vatican (<title>ARV.</title> p. 19, foot).</p>

<p>A small addition may be made to the Proto-Panaitian Group. A fragment in the Louvre joins <rs key="Louvre G 77" type="Vase">Louvre G 77</rs>, no. 2 in the list (<title>ARV.</title> p. 211), on the right, giving the rest of the fingers and skyphos, and the upper part of a youth moving to right playing the flute.</p>

V.</title> p. 166 no. 12. See also <title>Gnomon</title> 7 p. 327 (Langlotz).</p>

<p>From the point of view of shape, this is an ordinary cup of type B. The decoration is confined to the interior. A large picture (see <ref target="ii.23" n="U">ii p. 23</ref>). Symposion: a man and a youth share a couch; the man plays the flute, while the youth vomits. The man leans back on a wineskin which serves as a cushion. His legs are raised and spread out in a sprawling attitude, and the left leg is in one of the characteristic late archaic positions — knee, shank, <pb xml:id="ii.25" n="25"/> and extended foot all frontal, the front of the thigh concealed, the back of it visible behind the shank. Patroclos on the Berlin Sosias cup (<rs key="Berlin F 2278" type="Vase">Berlin F 2278</rs>; FR. pl. 123, whence Hoppin ii p. 423; Pfuhl fig. 418: <title>ARV.</title> p. 21 no. 1) and the old reveller on the cup by the Panaitios Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 44" type="Vase">London E 44</rs>; FR. pl. 23, whence Hoppin i p. 389; <title>ARV.</title> p. 214 no. 11) are in kindred attitudes. A short wrap is placed under the flute-player and hangs over his thigh. His young friend sits frontal, also in a straddling position, with one foot on the ground and the other on the couch. He supports himself with his right hand pressing on his right knee and the left hand holding the thigh. The right leg is in another characteristic late archaic attitude: like the left leg of the flute-player, but with the foot firm and foreshortened. A wrap hangs over his thighs. A pair of loose boots stands on the ground in the middle; flute-case and mouthpiece-box hang on the wall. The drawing is contoured with relief-lines. The outline of the hair is incised, except at the nape of the youth, where it is reserved. Red is used for the wreaths, the cord of the mouthpiece-box, the rejected wine, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*I*D*R*O*M*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. This is a common kalos-name (<title>ARV.</title> p. 922), but does not occur elsewhere in the Panaitian circle.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>On vomiting-scenes, the seamy side of the symposion, see above, <ref target="i.23" n="U">i p. 23</ref>. They are specially common in late archaic red-figure, but occur occasionally in black-figure, for instance on the Loeb psykter in Munich (<ref target="ii.7" n="U">ii p. 7</ref>, A. 11).</p>

<p>Hartwig, and Jacobsthal (<title>Gött. V.</title> p. 41), took the flute-player for a barbarian. He certainly has a poor beard, but not worse than the vomiting komast on the Leagros cup in the Louvre (Hartwig pl. 9: <title>ARV.</title> p. 212 no. 12), the komast on a cup-fragment from the Acropolis (Langlotz pl. 12, 225), the elderly wooer on a Naples cup in the manner of Epiktetos (<title>Mus. Borb.</title> 14 pl. 29: <title>ARV.</title> p. 53 no. 10), the komast on a cup by Onesimos in Boston (Pl. XLIII and <ref target="ii.33" n="U">ii p. 33</ref>), and many others whom there is no reason to regard as barbarians. The meagre beard and moustache are touches of naturalism like the thinning of the hair at the temples, the projection of the Adam's apple, the unlovely forehead and nose, the wild eye and farouche look.</p>

<p>Wineskins often serve as cushions: for instance on the symposion cup by the Foundry Painter in Boston (Pl. XIII: <title>ARV.</title> p. 264 no. 11: see <ref target="i.29" n="U">i p. 29</ref>).</p>

<p>The date of the cup should be a little before 500. It belongs to the Proto-Panaitian Group (<title>ARV.</title> p. 212 no. 14); and the large, free composition of the big picture, the limber movements, the slim arms and legs, with much else, recall the Panaitios Painter: this might possibly be a very early work by the painter himself.</p>

<pb xml:id="ii.26" n="26"/>
<p>The cup is of type B; a rather small cup, decorated inside only, but with a large picture (see <ref target="ii.23" n="U">ii p. 23</ref>). According to Bloesch the potter was Euphronios (<title>F.A.S.</title> p. 76 no. 25).</p>

<p>A pointed amphora lies on its side, and a satyr is trying to sit on it. Then he will balance himself and kick about. The position of the legs recalls the figures on the Epidromos cup (<rs key="Boston 01.8018" type="Vase">Boston 01.8018</rs>: Pl. XXXVIII, above). This is one of the grandest of satyrs. The unwieldy body contrasts with the eager hands and the intensity in the forward thrust of the magnificent head.</p>

<p>The contours are in relief-line. Much brown inner marking. The forehead is wrinkled; brown lines model the cheek, and there is a brown line between eye and eyebrow. Bushy brow, moustache, and beard. A repainted fracture runs through the right hand. The external oblique muscle at the right side is drawn as passing in front of the thigh instead of behind it: this strange rendering recurs, as Dietrich von Bothmer pointed out to me, on a later vase, the Nolan amphora by the Oionokles Painter in Berne (<rs key="Berne 12215" type="Vase">Berne 12215</rs>: <title>Rev. arch.</title> 1910, i, pp. 222-5; Bloesch <title>AKS.</title> pll. 32 and 35, 2); a third example is on an early cup by Makron in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 157" type="Vase">Louvre G 157</rs>: Pottier pl. 123: <title>ARV.</title> p. 305 no. 64) and a fourth on an archaic gem of banded agate in New York 35.11.11: <title>Bull. Metr. Mus.</title> 30 p. 256). Red for the imperial, the ivy-wreath, the ankle-cord, the inscriptions in the field. On ankle-cords see Wolters <title>Faden und Knoten als Amulett</title> (in <title>ARW.</title> 8, supplement).</p>

<p>A pointed amphora is not a very comfortable seat, but on a cup by Epiktetos in Florence (part, <title>CV.</title> pl. 5B4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 49 no. 60) a naked youth sits on a pointed amphora — perhaps balancing himself, but the left hand is missing and the motive not quite certain; on a cup by Onesimos in Florence (<title>ARV.</title> p. 220 no. 14) a woman sits on a pointed amphora and plays the flute, and so does a man on a cup by the Penthesilea Painter in Brunswick (<rs key="Brunswick 668" type="Vase">Brunswick 668</rs>; <title>CV.</title> pl. 15, 5-6: <title>ARV.</title> p. 585 no. 37); in the Etruscan scarab Berlin 231 (Furtwängler <title>A.G.</title> pl. 19, 40) Herakles sits on a pointed amphora. A figure distinctly resembling ours is on the interior of an Etruscan red-figured cup in the Musée Rodin, Paris (Plaoutine in <title>JHS.</title> 57 pl. 1 and <title>CV.</title> pll. 28-30; <title>EVP.</title> pl. 4, 1-3, p. 3, and pp. 25-7): a satyr sits on the bottom of an inverted calyx-krater balancing himself and kicking out: the pictures on the exterior are copied from an Attic cup of about 470, and the inside picture probably had an Attic model too.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The inscriptions are, in red, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*E*A*G*R*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, retrograde, on the left, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*O*D*O*T*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign> on the right, and, in dark brown, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, perhaps referring to the satyr, on the pointed amphora.</p>

<p>I take the cup to be a very early work of the Panaitios Painter, resembling both the boxer cup (<rs key="Boston 01.8021" type="Vase">Boston 01.8021</rs>: Pl. XXXIX), and the earlier Epidromos cup (<rs key="Boston 01.8018" type="Vase">Boston 01.8018</rs>: Pl. XXXVIII, above).</p>

<p>A small cup-fragment in Heidelberg (<rs key="Heidelberg 52" type="Vase">Heidelberg 52</rs>: Kraiker pl. 9) has part of a satyr's head which recalls ours in its grandeur: Kraiker attributes it to the Panaitios Painter, and it is certainly like him.</p>

<p>I, a large picture (see <ref target="ii.23" n="U">ii p. 23</ref>): a boxer: the young athlete stands with his left leg frontal, looking down towards his left, holding in both hands one of the thongs with which he will bind his hands. He will now draw the thong smartly through his hands to remove the creases which it has acquired by hanging folded up: see <title>CV.</title> Oxford p. 5, right. The mouth and upper lip are not what one expects to find in the Panaitios Painter and not what one finds on the reverse of the cup. The reason is that this is a boxer and his nose and lip are swollen. Large head, short legs, slender limbs, the stance limber and loose, the transition from head to shoulder imperfect and attractive. Behind him, a pick; on the wall, a pair of halt&emacr;res. Parts of the maeander are modern, especially north-west and east. Relief contour, brown inner markings, red for the fillet, the thong, the hanger of the halt&emacr;res, and the inscriptions: —  <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*O*D*O*T*O*S</foreign>, and retr. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>; on the left, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>; on the right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, retr.</p>

<p>A-B, battle. On A, a young warrior runs his spear, underhand, into the groin or belly of another, who tries to draw his sword, but sinks back, mouth open, his helmet falling off. On the left, a third warrior moves away, looking round, with a twist of his body — this is not an orderly retreat; on the right, a fourth also makes off, and may have been looking back. On B, a young warrior, sword in hand, pursues another, who still has his spear, but has turned tail, is wounded, stumbles, and falls; a third warrior comes to his rescue, levelling his spear at the pursuer.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Heroic nudity: all wear helmets, and, except the falling youth on B, greaves: but otherwise they are naked, save that the rescuer has a short wrap tied hastily round his waist. The helmets, of 'chalcidizing' type, have a nasal, and cheek-pieces in one with the caul. The painter has been careless about the greaves: in half of them either the upper edge or the lower is omitted. The end of the victor's spear on A is not closed. The rescuer has his crest fixed into a hole at the crown of the helmet, instead of in the more usual manner like the rest. The shield-devices are an anchor with cable, a tripod (?), a horse (part of the hindlegs and tail remain), rings, a polyp.</p>

<p>The contours are again in relief-line. There is much brown inner marking, more than appears in Hartwig's drawing. Red is used for the baldrics, the blood, and the inscriptions: on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S [*K]*A*L*O*S</foreign>, on B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Of the many battle-scenes on Attic vases, two resemble ours rather closely. The three-figure picture on one half of the early cup by Douris in Boston (<rs key="Boston 00.338" type="Vase">Boston 00.338</rs>: Hartwig pl. 21, whence Hoppin i p. 229 and Pfuhl figs. 451-2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 280 no. 8) is very like our B, although the fallen warrior is still able to strike back; and the fallen man on the other half draws his sword like the youth on A. On a kyathos in London, connected in style with the Panaitios Painter, the fleeing youth is even closer to ours than on the Douris cup (<rs key="London E 808" type="Vase">London E 808</rs>: FR. pl. 74, 2; <title>CV.</title> pl. 34, 4 and pl. 35, 4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 955, addendum to pp. 216-19). For the wound on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">nei/aton ei)s kenew=na</foreign>, see Nierhaus in <title>Jb.</title> 53 pp. 109-11, for the underhand thrust ibid. p. 107 and Lorimer in <title>BSA.</title> 42 p. 110; for the helmet about to fall off, above, <ref target="ii.21" n="U">ii p. 21</ref>.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B: according to Bloesch it was fashioned by the potter Euphronios (<title>F.A.S.</title> p. 77 no. 34).</p>

<p>Formerly in the Bourguignon collection at Naples. The exterior is from a drawing by Caskey. Diameter 0.236. Hartwig pl. 14, 1 and p. 120 fig. 17. I, archers. A-B, athletes. About 500 B.C.: early work of the Panaitios Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 86 no. 7; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 167 no. 26; <title>ARV.</title> p. 213, above, no. 6). See also <title>Gnomon</title> 7 p. 328 (Langlotz).</p>

<p>I, a large picture (see <ref target="ii.23" n="U">ii p. 23</ref>): two archers. One stands, the other squats. The composition makes a sort of V, a form specially affected by the Brygos Painter, but found also in later pieces by the same artist as ours (<ref target="ii.32" n="U">ii p. 32</ref>). The standing archer holds the arrow with both hands and looks along it to make sure that it is straight. His bow, <pb xml:id="ii.28" n="28"/> strung, hangs from his left forearm, and his quiver is slung round him at his side. The other is testing his bow, holding it with both hands near the ends; the string hangs from the lower end of the bow. His quiver hangs to the left of the picture. Both youths are naked, but wear caps of foreign type, with shoulder-piece, flaps, and suspension-loop. The material is the fur of leopard-cubs, and the tail of the animal serves to protect the neck. The flaps are of leather. The squatting youth has two flaps on each side of the head: so has the archer on the arming cup by the Foundry Painter (<rs key="Boston 10.195" type="Vase">Boston 10.195</rs>: Pl. XI: <title>ARV.</title> p. 264 no. 11); and the hat on a cup by Onesimos has two flaps (<ref target="ii.35" n="U">ii p. 35</ref>). Both youths are intent on what they are doing; one has his mouth open, the lips of the other are just parted. Relief-lines for the contours; much brown inner marking; red for baldrics, bowstrings, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N[*O*D*O*T*O*S] *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. Repainted, the tip of the left-hand youth's forehead-hair, part of the right-hand youth's genitals, and part of the front of his cap.</p>

<p>The archers are not characterized as barbarians: they are Greeks: see Hartwig p. 123. The archer testing his arrow by looking along it is a favourite figure on vases and gems; sometimes he feels the point at the same time, sometimes not. An earlier example is on a cup in Boston (<rs key="Boston 00.336" type="Vase">Boston 00.336</rs>: Pl. III, 8: <title>ARV.</title> p. 91): and here are some others:</p>

<p>Alabastron by Psiax in Odessa (Hoppin ii p. 403; <title>AJA.</title> 1934 p. 548: <title>ARV.</title> p. 8 no. 5); cup in Munich, <rs key="Munich 2593" type="Vase">Munich 2593</rs> (J.1229); cup by Oltos in Leipsic (<rs key="Leipsic T 3371" type="Vase">Leipsic T 3371</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 36 no. 23); cup-fragments by Epiktetos in Athens, North Slope (<title>Hesp.</title> 9 p. 240, 261 a-b: <title>ARV.</title> p. 48 no. 40 and p. 949); cup, manner of Epiktetos, in London (<rs key="London E 33" type="Vase">London E 33</rs>: Murray no. 19; <title>Jb.</title> 44 p. 192: <title>ARV.</title> p. 52 no. 5); cup formerly in New York, <rs key="New York 96.9.67" type="Vase">New York 96.9.67</rs> (B.Ap. 22, 105: I, Herakles holding an arrow; A, Theseus and the Bull; B, lion attacking bull, herdsmen to the rescue); cup-fragment in Athens, Agora, <rs key="Athens, Agora P 647" type="Vase">Athens, Agora P 647</rs>; fragment of a volute-krater by the Kleophrades Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab.

<p>Gems: Athens, from Perachora; Oxford (Furtwängler <title>AG.</title> pl. 6, 40); Louvre (ibid. pl. 6, 37); London (ibid. pl. 7, 49); Cabinet des Médailles (ibid. pl. 9, 20); New York (ex Southesk: ibid. pl. 9, 23 and pl. 51, 4: <title>LHG.</title> pl. A, 10; <title>Bull. Metr.</title> 26 p. 257); Leningrad, gold ring (Furtwängler <title>AG.</title> pl. 10, 27; Lippold <title>Gemmen</title> pl. 66, 2).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Many of these archers have the bow hanging from the forearm as in the Boston cup: for example, on the New York scaraboid.</p>

<p>The testing of the bow is seen far more seldom than the testing of the arrow. On a cup by the Ambrosios Painter in the Vatican, the archer holds the bow with both hands near the ends, as in the Boston cup, but grips it also between his legs (<rs key="Vatican 507" type="Vase">Vatican 507</rs>: <title>Mus. Greg.</title> ii pl. 74, 2; Albizzati pl. 70: <title>ARV.</title> p. 72 no. 12). This motive is to be distinguished from the much commoner one of the bow held between the legs to string it (see Pl. XI, and <title>CF.</title> p. 30, left, above).</p>

<p>For the drawing of the quivers compare the cup by the Panaitios Painter in Syracuse (<title>Sumbolae De Petra</title> p. 81; <title>RM.</title> 46 p. 191: <title>ARV.</title> p. 213, middle, no. 3).</p>

<p>A-B, athletes: three figures on each half, all in rapid movement. A: on the right, an athlete running to right; behind him a pair of acontia; then another, to left, perhaps bending, with an acontion in his hand — unless what remains is part of a pick resting on the ground (cf. Pl. VII); then a third, running to right, with a pair of acontia in each hand. B: a fourth to right, in his left hand a halt&emacr;r; a fifth to right, with a pair of acontia; a sixth to left; behind him a pair of acontia. The technique is as before; red for the fillet.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B. The foot is missing.</p>

<p>Formerly in Hartwig's possession. I, athlete; A, athletes. About 500 B.C., early work of the Panaitios Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 86 no. 12; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 167 no. 21; <title>ARV.</title> p. 213, above, no. 5).</p>

<p>Inside, the upper part of a youth remains, the breast frontal, the head looking down to left: probably an athlete. The contours are in relief-lines. The brown lines on the <pb xml:id="ii.29" n="29"/> shoulder and arm, for the sinew of the neck, and for the nostril, hardly appear in the photograph. Red is used for the fillet and for the inscription: on the right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q[*E*N*O*D*O*T*O*S]</foreign>, on the left, retrograde, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K[*A*L*O*S]</foreign>.</p>

<p>All that remains of A is the leg of an athlete running to left, and the lower half of another, running to right, with a halt&emacr;r in his left hand. Relief-lines for the contour.</p>

<p>Although the fragment must be by the Panaitios Painter himself, it stands somewhat apart from the series of early Panaitian works: the stroke is thinner and more refined, as if drawn 'with a different pen'.</p>

<p>I: the youth bends, his right leg set forward, his right arm extended downwards with the discus resting against the forearm, the left arm raised. This is a moment in the backward swing which precedes the forward swing and the throw (Norman Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> pp. 330-6 and <title>Athl.</title> pp. 163-7). The back is shown in three-quarter view. An unusual and not very successful figure: for other representations of the backward swing see below, on the exterior.</p>

<p>On the left, aryballos, strigil, and sponge hang from a thong by cords; behind, a pair of acontia. A repainted fracture runs down through the back to the middle of the iliac furrow and then through thigh and calf. The black of the background encroaches on the right arm above the elbow, marring the outline. The contours are in relief-lines; brown inner markings; red for wreath, thong, cords, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A*N*A*I*T*I*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>The three-quarter-view discus occurs as early as the middle of the sixth century on black-figured cups by the Heidelberg Painter in Munich (<rs key="Munich inv. 7739" type="Vase">Munich inv. 7739</rs>: <title>Anz.</title> 1938 p. 449) and the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 314" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 314</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 45, 1-5).</p>

<p>A-B: on A the chief figure is a jumper, on B a discus-thrower: both scenes represent practice in the palaestra. A: the jumper is in mid air, both arms extended. It is the top of the jump, and corresponds, barring the halt&emacr;res, to the photograph of a modern jumper published by Norman Gardiner (<title>Athl.</title> fig. 108); see also Norman Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 304. On the right is a trainer in an energetic attitude, 'ready to correct any <pb xml:id="ii.30" n="30"/> mistake with his rod'. On the left an athlete runs to left, looking back, a halt&emacr;r in each hand: according to Norman Gardiner he is using the halt&emacr;res as dumb-bells (<title>G.A.S.</title> p. 312; <title>Athl.</title> p. 150): but this does not seem certain: perhaps he is only hastening to the take-off and looking round at his companion's jump; nor is it clear that a dumb-bell exercise is depicted on an oinochoe by the Disney Painter in London (<rs key="London E 561" type="Vase">London E 561</rs>: <title>JHS.</title> 24 p. 192 = Norman Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 311: <title>ARV.</title> p. 733 no. 12), or on a contemporary oinochoe, by another painter, in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2451" type="Vase">Munich 2451</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 89, 3). On the extreme left of our picture, a pair of halt&emacr;res hangs by a cord.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 30, line 8: the halt&emacr;res are on B not A.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>B: as in the inside picture, the backward swing of the discus is represented, but the athlete leans back instead of forward, and his left arm is extended almost horizontally. The discus is shown in full profile. The young trainer facing him is a free repetition of the corresponding figure on A. On the left is a jumper, bending somewhat, his arms extended with the halt&emacr;res. On the ground, a pick.</p>

<p>All the athletes on the exterior are wreathed. The wreaths, and the hanger of the halt&emacr;res on A, are in red. Relief-lines for the contour; brown inner markings.</p>

<p>The discus-thrower on a large and fine cup by the Panaitios Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 287" type="Vase">Louvre G 287</rs>: <title>VA.</title> p. 84: <title>ARV.</title> p. 213 no. 6) resembles both ours: he leans back like the athlete on our A; but like the athlete on our interior, he raises his left arm above his head, and torso and buttocks are seen in three-quarter view from behind. This is the attitude of two out of the many bronze discus-throwers that served as knobs on the lids of Capuan dinoi: one formerly in the Wyndham Cook collection (<title>Burl. Cat. 1903</title> pl. 50; <title>JHS.</title> 27 p. 18 = Norman Gardiner <title>G.A.S.</title> p. 326 fig. 80; Norman Gardiner <title>Athl.</title> fig. 128), the other in the Petit Palais, Paris (Froehner <title>Coll. Dutuit</title> ii pl. 149, 169, whence Reinach <title>Rép.</title> iii p. 153, 5): Riis in <title>From the Coll.</title> ii p. 158 nos. 3 and 1. Discus-throwers in this attitude, but not seen from behind, are frequent on Attic vases of the second half of the fifth century:</p>

<p>This is no longer a very early work of the Panaitios Painter: it belongs to his early prime, the period of the two great pieces with the signature of Euphronios the potter, the Theseus cup in the Louvre, the Eurystheus cup in the British Museum (<title>ARV.</title> p. 214 nos. 10 and 11).

<p>According to Gerhard, who had his information from Camilli, the vase was found by Pietro Saveri in a property of his, three miles from Viterbo (<title>Bull.</title> 1830 p. 233). Not long after, it was acquired from the dealer De Dominicis by the Rev. J. and Mrs. [Elizabeth Caroline] Hamilton Gray. In 1855 it was deposited, with the rest of the Hamilton Gray collection, in the Museum of Bethnal Green, London, where it remained till 1887, when it was acquired by Adolphe van Branteghem. It was no. 52 in the Branteghem sale catalogue in 1892, and was purchased by Edward Warren for the Museum of Fine Arts. The surface is in bad condition: many of the relief-lines have lost their black and are discernible only as furrows; worse, modern black has sunk into furrows and other crevices and cannot be dislodged.</p>

<p>Komos. I, two men. One moves lightly forward, playing the flute; the other tries to dance, but has to support himself on his stick. The flute-player wears a cloak over his shoulders. He has a short moustache, a short, stiff chin-beard, rendered by relief-lines, and whiskers, done in brown. The other man is naked, but wears shoes; he has a normal beard. A flute-case, of leopard-skin, with its mouthpiece-box, hangs in the field. The lower part of the box is missing. The small maeander, running in twos, is of a type common in Onesimos, and found in some other cups of the Panaitios Painter. On the left, retrograde, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*F*R*O*N*I*O*S*E*P*O*P*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>, on the right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S*H*O*P*A*I*S</foreign>. The mis-spelling has been called a barbarism (Pottier <title>Vases du Louvre</title>, p. 696): it arises from a dittography, and is a mere slip, such as everyone makes, nearly every day, but he can cross out, and the vase-painter could not.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A-B: komos: the disorderly procession of eleven figures runs round the whole cup with a slight break at one handle. The revellers are all bearded men, and one of them is bald. They have evidently drunk already, and are going on to another place where there will be more drinking. On A, two couples and a single. The party is headed by a light-haired man, seen from the front, wheeling round, then, in our direction, but looking back at his companions. He has a cloak over his shoulders, holds a stick in his right hand and a large skyphos in his left. Beside him is the flute-player, tripping forward in much the <pb xml:id="ii.32" n="32"/> same attitude as the flute-player inside the cup, but more excited. He wears a short cloak on both shoulders. Then comes a dog, looking down and picking his way. Then a group of two: a man steps forward, his cloak on his left arm, his stick in his right hand, in his left hand a very large kylix held by the foot: he is not obviously the worse for liquor, but he looks round at his companion who obviously is: this man has dropped his cloak and stick, and seizes his friend by forearm and shoulder, to support himself, or to show affection, or both, and is going to be troublesome. This half of the procession is closed by the bald man, who strides along with cloak, stick, and a large phiale-like bowl, looking back and up, with his mouth open, as if calling to the rest. Under the handle is a dog, standing and waiting for the detachment on B. Both dogs wear collars. On B, three couples. A man staggers along with arms extended, looking down, his cloak on his left arm; his companion, cloak on shoulders, stick in left hand, right arm extended, looks round at those who follow. The middle group on this side forms a pendant to the middle group on the other: here again one man is relatively sober. A naked man, skyphos in hand, turns round towards one who has retained his cloak and stick, and holds a lyre as well, but has difficulty in advancing, and, in the words of Fröhner, 'fearful of dropping his lyre, hands it to the figure preceding him'. The last couple consists of a man rushing forward, with cloak and stick, who turns round towards his naked friend, urging him to make haste; and the friend does his best. Under the handle is a pointed amphora lying on its side.</p>

<p>The large phiale-like bowl held by the bald man is an unusual kind of drinking-vessel: on a cup formerly in the Paris market (see <ref target="ii.41" n="U">ii p. 41</ref>) a satyr drinks out of a very large phiale.</p>

<p>The contours are in relief-lines. Brown inner markings. Most of the men wear wreaths, two of them simple fillets. Wreaths, fillets, plectrum, plectrum-cord, dog-collars are in red, also the inscriptions in the field: on A, retr., <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A*N*A*I*T*I*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, on B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A*N*A*I*T*I*O*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. On the pointed amphora, in brown, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*H*O*P]*A*I*S</foreign> (little remains of the sigma and its form is uncertain).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The cup, of type B, was fashioned by the potter Euphronios, as the inscription says, and is no. 6 in Bloesch's list (<title>F.A.S.</title> p. 71). It is very nearly as large as the great Theseus cup, also signed by Euphronios, in the Louvre. The foot was readjusted in antiquity. Mrs. Hamilton Gray wrote as follows in her <title>Tour to the Sepulchres of Etruria in 1839</title> (1839) p. 56: 'Our grand Viterbo tazza... had also been mended before interment; a circumstance which was discovered by Dedomenicis to his infinite surprise and satisfaction, and which enhanced its value in our eyes. It has a small cylinder of iron run through the bottom of the tazza to join it to the stalk.' Fröhner says that the presence of this iron nail was confirmed by W. Talbot Ready when the cup came into his hands after the sale to van Branteghem.</p>

<p>The cup is a good deal later than the others by the same painter in Boston, and the proportions of the figures, in particular, are different. It leads on to the work of Onesimos, who continues the style of the Panaitios Painter in a less forcible and more graceful form: unless, indeed, Onesimos is the Panaitios Painter himself in a late phase. This conjecture of Furtwängler's, though afterwards abandoned by him, has always seemed to me to deserve most serious consideration (<title>ARV.</title> pp. 209 and 218-19).</p>

<p>Hartwig saw that the Boston cup stood specially close to an unsigned cup in Leningrad (Hartwig pl. 48, 2 and pl. 49, with restorations, whence Perrot 10 pp. 773-5 and, A, Pfuhl fig. 406; I and A, with the restorations indicated, <title>Anz.</title> 1913 p. 93: <title>ARV.</title> p. 216 no. 32):<note anchored="true" n="ii.32.1"><p>This is not the cup described in <title>Bull.</title> 1871 p. 117, which is <rs key="Berlin 2309" type="Vase">Berlin 2309</rs>, by the Brygos Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 248 no. 37). Urlichs confused the two cups (<title>Beiträge zur Kunstgeschichte</title> p. 61 note 1): Klein pointed out the error (<title>Meist.</title> p. 176), but it is repeated by Hartwig. The Leningrad cup is described by P. J. Meier in <title>Bull.</title> 1884 pp. 40-5.</p></note> Again a V-shaped composition within, here a man vomiting, his head held by a boy; outside, another unruly band of bearded revellers, and here they have come to blows. A third cup that may be placed near these, fragmentary, is in the Villa Giulia (<rs key="Villa Giulia 18558" type="Vase">Villa Giulia 18558</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 215 no. 30: the interior now published in <title>Hesp.</title> suppl. viii pl. 2, 2). Nor should the beautiful fragments in Florence and Heidelberg be forgotten (<title>CV</title>. Fl. <pb xml:id="ii.33" n="33"/> pl. 10 B 106 and <title>CF.</title> pl. Y 15: <title>ARV.</title> p. 214 no. 13): inside, an unsteady elderly reveller is led along by a naked girl with a mole on her wrist: somewhat earlier than the cups in Boston, Leningrad, and Villa Giulia.</p>

<p>Two fragments of a cup. Acquired by Hartwig at Sta. Maria, afterwards in the collection of Adolphe van Branteghem (Fröhner <title>Coll. van Branteghem, Catalogue, Paris 16-18 juin 1892</title>, p. 31 no. 75). Hartwig pl. 36, 4 and 5. I, (woman); A, (woman and youth). About 490-480 B.C., manner of the Panaitios Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 217 no. 14).</p>

<p>I. A woman sits, with an intent look, bending, and holding something with both hands. She wears chiton, himation, earring. Relief contours. The hair, so far as it is preserved, is in golden-brown lines, and the same diluted glaze is used for the crinkle of the chiton. Thin relief-lines edge the lips, and another relief-line indicates the vertical furrow between mouth and cheek. The outline of the nose just below the eyebrow is slightly damaged and so is the tip of the nose — the tilt is not original. A flake has removed the lower edge of the left sleeve and part of the himation-fold below it. Part of the seat-cover is seen, but all that remains of the seat itself is the top of one front-leg.</p>

<p>Women in such attitudes are often holding or twining wreaths, but it is not certain that the missing object here was a wreath.</p>

<p>There was probably only one figure in the picture.</p>

<p>A. Outside, one sees the left arm of a woman spinning, holding the distaff, and between thumb and forefinger the yarn. A youth, leaning on the stick held in his left hand, bends right forward with his right arm extended, his thumb apparently touching his forefinger, as if peremptorily calling the woman's attention. The upper edge of his himation shows near the waist just before the fragment ends. The thumb, the inside of the ear, the outline of the nose at eye-level, are slightly damaged. Between the two figures the wings of a small bird. Relief-lines for all contours. The lips and the furrow between cheek and mouth are rendered in the same way as before. The fair hair, the light whisker, the nipple, and some detail on the body below it, are in diluted glaze. Red for the head-fillet, the distaff and thread, the inscription ...<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O[*S]</foreign>.</p>

<p>Hartwig attributed the fragments to the Brygos Painter, but they are evidently close to the late work of the Panaitios Painter — and of course to Onesimos. A cup-fragment in Heidelberg (<rs key="Heidelberg 56" type="Vase">Heidelberg 56</rs>: Kraiker pl. 8: our Suppl. Pl. 8, 4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 217 no. 15), with a youth leaning on his stick and holding out a wreath in both hands, is in the same style, and might even be from the same cup, although the scale seems a little smaller and the execution a little less fine. It was bought by Hartwig in Rome in April 1896, but the provenience is unknown.</p>

Only the core-fragment, with the foot of the cup, is in Boston: so much of the inside picture as is published in <title>VA.</title> p. 88. The other fragments are in Villa Giulia and Florence: in Suppl. plates 8-9 these are given from photographs, and the joins with the drawing of the Boston portion are naturally imperfect.</p>

<p>I. A reveller, not young, seems to be picking his way; but after looking at the pictures on the other side, one cannot be sure that he is not dancing. His left leg is frontal; he looks down, holding his stick in one hand and his cloak with the other. He has a hooked nose, a queer beard, and the beginning of a paunch. A long fillet, with tags at the ends, is tied round his head. A flute-case and a mouthpiece-box hang in the field. A small exergue below the feet. Inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S</foreign>, retr., and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The contours are in relief-lines, except for the lower two-thirds of the stick. Red for fillet and inscriptions.</p>

<p>A-B, a merry party. On A a naked girl moves quickly to left, playing the crotala, and doubtless looking round at a youth or man who dances with his left arm extended and his <pb xml:id="ii.34" n="34"/> right akimbo; he is followed by a naked youth, also dancing, but less violently, his left arm extended and his stick in his right hand. On the other side of the girl, a youth or man dances to right, bending, and holding a stick; he wears a cloak, and his head is bound with a long fillet. The girl has a cord round her left shank, with a bead fastened to it. This, the fillet, and the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A[*L*O*S...]</foreign>, are in red. On B, three youths are dancing; or at least the middle one is dancing, and the others follow his movements. The left-hand youth is naked, the others have cloaks; the two outer youths hold sticks. All three wear wreaths. 'The wreaths, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">[...*H*O*P]*A*I*S</foreign>, are in red. The surface of the vase has suffered more on B than on A.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B.</p>

<p>Nos. 31 and 33 in the Onesimos list are from the same cup as no. 51, and these, with other Louvre fragments, almost complete the pictures. No. 32 also has received accessions from fragments in the Louvre, and not much is now missing.</p>

<p>A fragment in Bryn Mawr belongs to our no. 11: joining <title>AJA</title> 1916 p. 343, 20 and giving the middle of the youth. While attributing the two fragments ibid. 20-1 to Onesimos (ibid. p. 342) Miss Swindler mentioned 'an additional fragment' in Bryn Mawr 'with the head of a horse' (raised, to right) as 'in the manner of Onesimos'. She implied that it came from the same cup as the two, which did not seem certain to me. Another Bryn Mawr fragment is probably from the same cup as that with the horse's head: it gives, outside, the hindquarters of a horse to left and the outstretched right arm of a male to left who holds a cord in his right hand and a pair of javelins in his left. Both fragments are Onesiman and probably by the painter himself.</p>

<p>No. 5 in the list is now published in <title>CV.</title> Vienna University pl. 11, 2 and 4 and pl. 13, 3-4; no. 3 in the list of vases in the manner of Onesimos (<title>ARV.</title> p. 223), in <title>Hesp.</title> suppl. viii pl. 2, 3.

<p>A cup-fragment in the Louvre, with, outside, the upper part of a youth, head bent in three-quarter view to left, with the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L[*O*S]</foreign>, is at least in the manner of Onesimos.</p>

<p>I. An elderly man, naked, seems to be picking his way with great care through a wet or muddy place; in his left hand he holds a food-basket, as well as his stick, in his right a metal water-pot with two handles and a bail. His lips are parted. He has a snub nose, and a bald head, which is wreathed. The contours are in relief-lines. His right nipple is a small brown circle, but there seem to be no other brown inner markings either in this figure or in any of the youths on the exterior. Red for the wreath, the cord and tags of the basket, and the inscription in the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.

<p>In three of these cups the pot is seen at the well, in one it is carried by a girl going to wash, in two it is in use at the symposion, as it will be in our vase. That it contains water is a fair inference. We may guess that our man has just left the well and is picking his steps through the soft wet ground beside it.</p>

<p>Outside, youths and horses. A: the horse rubs his muzzle, which may have been stung by a fly, against his right foreleg; he raises the leg, and at the same time his right hindleg. Meanwhile the naked boy in charge of him waits, looking back at the horse, letting the rope of the halter run loose, a spear or wand in his right hand. Beyond the horse is a tree; behind, another youth, wrapped in his himation, looking at the horse. A pair of spears leans against the wall. Above the horse's head, a hat, of skin, hangs on a peg. The hat, like one of those on a cup already described (<ref target="ii.28" n="U">ii p. 28</ref>), has two flaps at each side, in addition to the tail-piece protecting the neck. The peg, of a common type, is drawn in profile, as if it were clapped to the wall instead of projecting from it at right-angles: compare the peg on the Foundry Painter's cup (Pl. XI).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>An Attic red-figured askos of type 2 (<title>ARV.</title> p. ix), in Reggio, from Medma, has on one side a horse brushing a fly off his face, on the other a horse tied to a ring: period of the Penthesilea Painter. Horse and youth in the same motive as on the Boston cup appear on the west side of the Parthenon frieze (slab 12: A. H. Smith pl. 69).</p>

<p>The dotted brand on the horse's rump is half-familiar: it reminds one of three popular brands, the koppa-mark, the caduceus-mark, and the mark that looks like the head of a caduceus without the shaft but may really be the head of a bull: but our brand is none of these, and I do not remember seeing it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The mouth of the boy with the horse is damaged, and the right heel of the other boy, with the neighbouring part of the himation.</p>

<p>B: in the middle, a youth, who has tied his cloak round his waist, is adjusting the halter of a horse which sinks its head against its breast and raises both right legs. The end of the tail is cut off by the handle, or is thought of as being beneath the handle. Behind, a pair of spears. Another horse stands behind the youth, tied to a peg. Head and middle of the horse are missing as well as part of the tail; the face of the youth is damaged. A hat, probably of skin, hangs on the peg.</p>

<p>The contours are in relief-lines. A brown line indicates the sterno-mastoid, but there are no other brown markings in the human figure, or none remain. In the right-hand <pb xml:id="ii.36" n="36"/> horse on B, the feather-mark near the groin is in brown; in the horse on A, the marks near the elbow and the brand on the hindquarters. The fillets worn by the youths on B, the halters, and the leaves are in red.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B.</p>

<p>The Armour of Achilles had long been a favourite theme with Attic vase-painters, but it is not until the late archaic period that we are taken into the workshop of Hephaistos. Four of the five vases with the subject belong to the decade 490-480 (Bulas <title>Les illustrations antiques de l'Iliade</title> p. 12; Johansen <title>Iliaden</title> pp. 95-7 and 156; <title>ARV.</title> index p. 981); the fifth, a white alabastron in Brussels, <rs key="Brussels A 2314" type="Vase">Brussels A 2314</rs>, is later, about 460 (<title>CV.</title> III Jb pl. 5, 8). The painters usually show Hephaistos seated, in front of his block, with a helmet in one hand and a file or hammer in the other, giving the last touch to the work. In the Boston vase the helmet hangs beside the greaves on the wall, and Hephaistos is polishing the shield with a soft rubber. His himation is tied round his waist, and he wears a workman's cap of wool or fur; he has a short, unfashionable beard and looks just like a workman. Thetis, wearing chiton, himation, spotted saccos, bracelet, stands facing him, eager if not impatient, giving an order or urging haste. The tone is not un-Homeric; in the eighteenth book of the <title>Iliad</title> Hephaistos has a very simple household. Greaves and helmet hang on the wall; and tools — hammer, pincers, and the bow used with the drill (<ref target="ii.21" n="U">ii p. 21</ref>). The helmet is of Corinthian type. The off cheek-piece is visible as well as the hither one. The greaves as often are fastened to a stand or rack. The device on the shield is a gorgoneion, with the tongue showing but not the teeth. The rim is studded with dots surrounded by circles.</p>

<p>In the Brussels alabastron, Hephaistos sits holding a helmet. The goddess standing in front of him, holding spear and shield, is not Thetis, but, as the aegis shows, Athena. It is probable, though not certain, that the painter means Hephaistos to be working at the armour of Achilles. That the armourer is Hephaistos and not a mortal is shown by his long hair. In two of the vases mentioned above, Athena is present as well as Thetis.</p>

<p>For representations of other helmet-makers see Richter in <title>AJA.</title> 1944 pp. 1-5; add the archaic Greek scaraboid of rock-crystal in Munich (<title>Anz.</title> 1917 p. 35), and another, of agate, in Nicosia.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>On the reverse of the Boston vase, Nike hastens to right, looking back, with oinochoe and phiale for the drink or the libation. She wears a chiton, with kolpos, a saccos, and bracelets. Between waist and knees a piece of stuff has been sewn to the chiton forming a double thickness. The figure is not connected with the principal scene.</p>

<p>Relief-lines contour the greater part of the figures, including the faces. There are brown inner markings on the body of Hephaistos, but the arcs that render his elbows are in relief. The hair of the gorgoneion is in raised black dots on a black ground; the <pb xml:id="ii.37" n="37"/> tongue is red on black. The small palmette at each handle is contoured with relief-lines, and the petals are all ribbed.</p>

<p>The grave in which the vase was found is described by Helbig (<title>RM.</title> 2 pp. 241-3). It was of the same type (cubo di tufo) as that which yielded the Nolan amphora by the Pan Painter (below, <ref target="ii.53" n="U">ii p. 53</ref>), but the lid was missing. The cinerary urn was a bronze vessel of stamnos-like shape, with bails and a lid, but no handles (<title>RM.</title> 2 p. 241 fig. 14.) The grave contained two Attic vases besides the Nolan by the Dutuit Painter: a small red-figured skyphos of glaux type (B, ibid. p. 243 fig. 16), and a shallow stemless cup, black (ibid. fig. 17).</p>

<p>To the list of vases by the Dutuit Painter in <title>ARV.</title> pp. 205-6 and 955 add an oinochoe of shape 5, from Nola, in the Paris market (Mikas: ex Durand 784, Pourtalès 354, Paravey, Piot: woman with mirror and flower): it is of the same model as nos. 12 and 13 in the list.</p>

<p>The shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 63. A, Eos and Tithonos; B, a boy fleeing. About 480 B.C., by the Tithonos Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 69 no. 1; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 128 no. 1; <title>ARV.</title> p. 206 no. 1). The present height is 0.306, but the foot is modern, and should doubtless have been restored somewhat differently, with the side black, and a fillet at the base.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 37: two sherds in the Naples Museum (ex Spinelli) add the left foot of Eos, the missing part of Tithonos' right foot and of the border below, and part of his himation (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 309 no. 1).</p></note></p>

<p>On the front, Eos pursues the boy Tithonos, and seizes him by the wrist; on the back, a companion of Tithonos flies in alarm. Both boys wear the himation and hold a lyre. Tithonos has a wreath, his friend a chaplet. Eos wears a chiton, and over it a himation which passes over the right shoulder. The skirt is of thick material, and the question whether it is part of the chiton or of the himation arises once again. The stephane is adorned with leaves, no doubt of gold. Earrings, bracelets.</p>

<p>Pictures of Eos pursuing a schoolboy, who holds a lyre, begin in the latest archaic period, our vase being one of the earliest. Pictures of Eos pursuing a young man, a hunter, begin in the early classic period. On three vases an inscription names the hunter, Kephalos; on one vase an inscription names the schoolboy, Tithonos. It would be natural, in uninscribed vases, to name the hunter Kephalos and the schoolboy Tithonos. The question is complicated, however, by two vases on which Eos is represented with a schoolboy who holds a lyre, not indeed pursuing him, but carrying him in her arms: one would expect the boy to be Tithonos; but his name is inscribed, Kephalos. It may be, therefore, that some of the schoolboys pursued by Eos are meant for Kephalos not Tithonos; and this is the view of H. R. W. Smith (<title>Der Lewismaler</title> p. 16). On the other hand, the Pantoxena Painter, on his skyphos in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 864" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 864</rs>: de Ridder p. 497 and pl. 23: <title>ARV.</title> p. 694, below, no. 1) names the boy with the lyre Tithonos, the companion Priamos (Priam was brother to Tithonos, both being sons of Laomedon) and a second companion Dardanos: this artist, at least, had no doubt that the victim of Eos was not an Athenian, but of the Trojan blood royal.<note anchored="true" n="ii.37.1"><p>A fragment of a red-figured bell-krater or calyx-krater in Syracuse, from Camarina (mentioned in <title>ML.</title> 14 p. 900), has the shoulder of one wearing a himation and the shoulder of a woman wearing a peplos; between, the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*P]*R*I*A*M[*O*S]</foreign>. Group of Polygnotos. This should be from a picture of Eos pursuing Tithonos, giving part of Eos, and part of brother Priam, fleeing. Eos wingless as in some other pictures where she pursues Tithonos or Kephalos: for instance on an early classic stamnos belonging to Mr. Robert Garrett, now on loan in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore (Tithonos), or the hydria <rs key="Durand 234" type="Vase">Durand 234</rs> (Kephalos).</p></note> I am inclined, therefore, to keep the name Tithonos for the schoolboys pursued by Eos: while admitting the serious difficulty caused by the groups of Eos with the boy in her arms. Other objections are unimportant: it is not unnatural that there should occasionally be a certain amount of confusion between the two parallel subjects: thus on the pelike by the Lykaon Painter in Leningrad, while Kephalos is not named, his comrade is inscribed Tithonos (Minervini <title>Mon. Barone</title> pl. 4; <title>CR.</title> 1872 pl. 5, 3-4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 690 no. 5); on the skyphos by the Pantoxena Painter, Dardanos is dressed like a companion of Kephalos; there is the same mixture on the bell-krater by the Christie Painter in Genoa (<rs key="Genoa 1216" type="Vase">Genoa 1216</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 9: <title>ARV.</title> <pb xml:id="ii.38" n="38"/> p. 693 no. 21); and on the neck-amphora by Hermonax in the Hearst collection at San Simeon (ex Lloyd: <title>ARV.</title> p. 320 no. 45), while Eos pursues a hunter on the obverse, the fleeing companion on the reverse is a boy holding a lyre.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>If the boy on the obverse of our vase is Tithonos, his friend on the reverse may be his brother Priam.</p>

<p>The lekythos is decorated on the 'Nolan' principle: see <ref target="ii.41" n="U">ii p. 41</ref>. Tongue-pattern at the top of the shoulder.</p>

<p>With her hand raised to her hair, and her head bent, she has the grave expression with which women give the last touch to their toilet. She wears chiton, himation, saccos, earrings, bracelet. The mirror is seen in profile. A perfume-vase ('smegmatotheke', 'kothon') stands on the ground in front: on these vases see Caskey, above, pp. 49-50. An alabastron hangs from a thong behind her; the brown streak running down it is one of the loose ends of the cord tied round the neck. On a less attractive lekythos by the same painter in Aberdeen (<rs key="Aberdeen 706" type="Vase">Aberdeen 706</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 207 no. 11) the woman holds in her left hand a kothon and in her right an alabastron just like those on the Boston vase.</p>

<p>There is not much relief-contour; none between the tip of the nose and the beginning of the chin. The bracelet is in red.</p>

<p>Height 0.305. Formerly in the Peytrignet collection at Nocera de' Pagani in Campania (<title>Bull.</title> 1864 p. 177, Helbig), later in the possession of Alessandro Castellani (1866 sale catalogue, no. 58); given by Thomas G. Appleton. A, E. Robinson p. 154; Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> pp. 50-1; the shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 65. Satyrs (A, one carrying another, a third following; B, a fourth looking on). On A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*A*R*M*I*D*E*S</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, on B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. About 470 B.C.: by the Charmides Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 74 no. 1; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 130 no. 11; <title>ARV.</title> p. 440 no. 12).</p>

<p>From the point of view of shape, the vase will be discussed below, <ref target="ii.39" n="U">ii pp. 39-40</ref>.</p>

<p>A satyr has hoisted his father, or an aged comrade, on his back and is struggling along. Father has his arms locked round son's neck, grasping his own right forearm with his left hand. Son holds father by the right arm with his right hand; his left hand is free and appears to make a gesture of mock despair which accords with the expression on his face. Father does not seem quite comfortable either, and he looks round as if expecting sympathy: it is more often the bearer who does this, <foreign xml:lang="greek">piezo/menos</foreign>; but obviously the burden might sometimes count himself qualified.</p>

<p>In contrast to this pair is the third satyr, who strides behind them grasping the father's tail, holds a sprig of ivy in his other hand, and is evidently well pleased with himself. If you have a donkey in front of you it is tempting to take him by the tail, and one <pb xml:id="ii.39" n="39"/> often sees boys or other slight persons doing it. On a black-figured psykter in New York (<rs key="New York 06.1021.80" type="Vase">New York 06.1021.80</rs>: see <ref target="ii.6" n="U">ii p. 6</ref>) a satyr grasps the tail of Dionysos' donkey and another the tail of Hephaistos's. On a late black-figured cup in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 236" type="Vase">Oxford 236</rs>) two satyrs each take a donkey by the tail. On a cup by Oltos in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre F 128" type="Vase">Louvre F 128</rs>: Pottier pl. 73: <title>ARV.</title> p. 37 no. 39) a satyr appears to take hold of a donkey's tail, but the hand is modern and the action not quite certain; on a cup by Oltos in Compiègne (<rs key="Compigne 1093" type="Vase">Compiègne 1093</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 14, 1-2 and 5: <title>ARV.</title> p. 41 no. 87) a maenad catches a donkey by the tail. On fragments of a cup by the Antiphon Painter in the Louvre a satyr takes hold of a donkey by the tail. Even in Hades, as is shown by the well-known black-figured lekythos in Palermo, the donkey's tail is not immune (Haspels <title>ABL.</title> pl. 19, 5).</p>

<p>There is a superficial resemblance between our group and the Castigation of Pan on a Roman sarcophagus in the British Museum (A. H. Smith <title>Cat. Sculpture</title> iii no. 2298: see also A. von Salis <title>Antike und Renaissance</title> pp. 112-24 and Degenhart in <title>Boll. d'Arte</title> 1950 pp. 208-15).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The fourth satyr, on the reverse of the vase, stands with his back to us, a stick in his right hand, his left arm akimbo, and looks round at the others. In art, figures shown from behind, as a rule, question, criticize, negate, darken: and so perhaps here.</p>

<p>One's first thought when looking at the obverse is of Aeneas, Anchises, and the wife of Aeneas (<title>VA.</title> p. 74): but this may be an illusion. Satyrs often carry maenads on their backs or shoulders, and sometimes other satyrs: a list is given by Brommer (<title>Satyrspiele</title> pp. 76-7). The group most like ours is on a late black-figure fragment in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 692" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 692</rs>: Graef pl. 46), where a satyr carries a small, white-haired satyr on his shoulders: but it does not help us. Our satyrs are all wreathed, and two of them wear thick fillets, tagged at the ends, round their heads. The foremost has a sprig of ivy tied round his right ankle and another round his left wrist: these correspond to the simple strings often worn as bracelets or anklets by youths and men, even heroes.<note anchored="true" n="ii.39.1"><p>Wolters <title>Faden und Knoten als Amulett</title> in <title>ARW.</title> 8, suppl., pp. 1-7 (but the supposed anklet in the Vatican cup ibid. p. 6 is due to restoration); add Karouzou on the modern <emph>martes</emph> in <title>AJA.</title> 1946 p. 128.</p></note> The hindmost satyr has a bigger spray of ivy round his right thigh, which recalls the string and bead or beads often worn in that place by women, and on Italiote vases by males; see Wolters <title>Faden und Knoten</title> pp. 5-6; he compares an Italiote bell-krater in the Louvre (Millin, <title>PVA.</title> 2 pl. 65), where one of the satyrs wears a wreath of ivy round his thigh as here.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is only the return from the party. A moment comes for the order 'Let those who can walk remove those who can't'. On the black-figured oinochoe by Kleisophos in Athens (<title>WV.</title> 1889 pl. 1, 3, whence Hoppin <title>Bf.</title> p. 145) the word has come too late.</p>

<p>This is a favourable specimen of the Charmides Painter's slight and somewhat ragged style. There is hardly any use of relief-lines for the contours, and, as elsewhere in this artist, things that would normally be drawn in black lines are drawn in brown, such as the shoulder-blades of the satyr on the reverse and the furrow of his spine. Wreaths, fillets, and ivy are in red; hair, beard, and tail of the old satyr are white.</p>

<p>This is one of seven small vases decorated by five different painters but all of the same shape. The shape may be thought of as a more elaborate variant of the normal Nolan amphora, from which it differs in the form of the mouth and foot and by the presence of a plastic reel placed horizontally below each handle; besides, although the later Nolan amphora usually has ridged handles, at this period the handles are still triple. The seven vases are the following:</p>

Four others, all decorated by the Alkimachos Painter, have the reels, and the same mouth, but the foot is different (<title>ARV.</title> pp. 356-7 nos. 16-19).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>To return to the seven vases: the first six are not only of one model, but should be by one <emph>potter</emph>; I have less information about the seventh, but. it may be by the same.</p>

<p>The upper section of the foot is reserved in all seven, and the upper surface of the mouth, as in the Nolan amphora, black.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 are connected by the meaningless inscriptions: on the London vase, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*U*I*O*S*K*I</foreign>. Similar inscriptions occur in other works by the Briseis Painter, but also on vases by the Painter of Louvre G 265 (<rs key="Louvre G 265" type="Vase">Louvre G 265</rs>, <title>ARV.</title> p. 273, below, no. 1) and by the Oionokles Painter (Nolan amphora in the Czartoryski collection, neck-amphora in the Bellon collection at Rouen, lekythos in Cleveland: <title>ARV.</title> pp. 437-9, nos. 9, 30, and 32: see <title>V. Pol.</title> p. 19). Again, <rs key="London E 319" type="Vase">London E 319</rs> is connected by the inscriptions with <rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 373" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 373</rs>, although one is by the Briseis Painter, the other by the Oionokles: the matter is the same (<foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos</foreign> four times, <foreign xml:lang="greek">kale</foreign> once; <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos</foreign> three times, <foreign xml:lang="greek">kale</foreign> once) and the writing, with four-stroke sigmas and carelessness in the direction of the letters, the same. These correspondences are a further indication that the painters at one time worked in the same place.</p>

<p>The subject of the Boston vase is a maenad dancing, while a satyr plays the flute, and another satyr also dances and plays the krotala. The satyr on the reverse of the vases faces to right, and so do the reverse figures on six of our seven vases. The maenad wears a chiton, with two 'kolpoi', and over it a panther-skin. Her extended arms are concealed by the parts of the garment which she draws out with her hands: 'wing-sleeves' is the modern name for this: the ancient name is unknown but must surely have been of the same sort. The Briseis Painter is fond of wing-sleeves, and there are fine examples of them on his thiasos cups in London and Oxford (<title>ARV.</title> p. 266 no. 1 and p. 267 no. 4). The London cup helps to explain the costume of our maenad (Hartwig pl. 41): for while one of the dancers is dressed like ours, the others show the upper girdle, not having pulled the chiton down over it to form the second 'kolpos'.</p>

<p>In the satyr playing the flute the toes of the left foot do not touch the ground: he may be lightly beating time as he plays.</p>

<p>Relief-lines are little used for the contours. The face of the maenad has relief-contour, but not those of the satyrs. The ivy-wreaths are in red.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>To the list of vases by the Briseis Painter in <title>ARV.</title> pp. 266-70 and 956 add a cup in Naples (?) (Vorberg <title>Gloss. erot.</title> p. 686: I, love-making: replica of no. 27); a cup-fragment, <pb xml:id="ii.41" n="41"/> from Orvieto, in Washington (A, youth and male: the upper half of a youth dressed in a himation, standing to right, and the forearm with hand of another figure holding a stick), and a stemmed dish in the Louvre (woman standing to right, holding a basket). The new Louvre vase, with its peculiar stem, shows that no. 24 in the list, <rs key="Louvre fr. Cp. 108" type="Vase">Louvre fr. Cp. 108</rs>, in which the outer parts are now missing, is not a cup but a stemmed dish. No. 26 is figured in Vorberg <title>Gloss. erot.</title> p. 109, 2, no. 45 in <title>CV.</title> Syracuse pl. 8, 1. No. 4 is now in Oxford, <rs key="Oxford 1944.87" type="Vase">Oxford 1944.87</rs>. The cup in the Paris market (A-B, <title>Coll. M.E.</title> pl. 11, 49: <title>ARV.</title> p. 270, foot) which I was inclined to connect with the Briseis Painter, is not his: it recalls the Ancona Painter. B of no. 22 does not represent the arrival of Helen at Troy: the subject is the same as in the cup by the Brygos Painter <rs key="Tarquinia RC 6846" type="Vase">Tarquinia RC 6846</rs> (<title>ARV.</title> p. 246 no. 4) — Paris returning to the house of Priam after the Judgement.<note anchored="true" n="ii.41.1"><p>So Hampe in <title>Corolla Curtius</title> p. 144. The left-hand figure inside the Briseis Painter's cup has always been called Apollo, but it is not characterized as Apollo, and I take it to be Paris. In the Tarquinia cup mentioned above it is Artemis who escorts Paris home and evidently vouches for him: she must have played an important part in the events, to us obscure, between the Judgement and the fatal return of Paris to his father's house. The moment shown inside the Briseis Painter's cup is between the Judgement and the Return, when Artemis, from whatever motive, appeared to Paris and offered to restore him to his home.</p></note> The winged men in no. 38 may be the sons of Boreas, as suggested by Miss Hutton in <title>BCH.</title> 1899 pp. 157-64.</p>

<p>Eros plays the flute as he flies. A short cloak hangs over left shoulder and right arm. The figure is contoured with relief-lines. The head-fillet is in red. The lekythos belongs to the same period as the three lekythoi by the same painter from Thebes (nos. 88-90), but is decorated on a different, the 'Nolan', principle: there is no pattern-band at the top of the body, and no palmettes on the shoulder, only the usual egg-pattern. This severer form of decoration is used, side by side with the other, on the red-figured lekythoi of the late archaic and early classic periods. If the subject is a winged figure — Eros or Nike — as it often is, the wings are usually carried over on to the shoulder of the vase as here: so, for example, among the Boston vases, on the Eros lekythoi by the Brygos Painter (Pl. IX, 21, and title-page) and the Pan Painter (Pl. LI, 2).</p>

<p>Some additions may be made to the list of vases by the Providence Painter given in <title>ARV.</title> pp. 431-6, 960, and 968: a lekythos which belonged to the Earl of Moray, then to Marshall Brooks, and is now in the collection of the Conde de Lagunillas, Havana, Cuba (a youth with spears, sword at side, pursuing a woman; restored), another in the collection of William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon, California (<rs key="San Simeon 9893" type="Vase">San Simeon 9893</rs>: a woman fleeing), another in the New York market (Hirsch: Nike moving to right with a phiale and an oinochoe, a fourth in the Otago Museum, Dunedin (ex A.

<p>This lekythos, that with Athena (Pl. XLVI, 3), and that with the Wedding of Menelaos (Pl. XLVI, 4) are reported to have been found in a single grave at Thebes. They are of the same shape, are decorated by the same artist, and bear the same kalos-name, Hippon.</p>

<p>Apollo stands with right leg frontal, head to left, holding his cithara on his left arm, and extending his right arm with a phiale in the hand. His long hair is wreathed. He wears a long chiton, and over it, on both shoulders, a chlamys-like himation. The thick cloth, ornamented with voided squares, and bordered with esses, appears regularly in pictures of citharodes, and so do the thin cords hanging from the shoulder of the instrument, which I have explained as spare strings (the middle of them is restored). Red is used for the plectrum, which is pushed between strings and sounding-board, and for its cord; also for the ends of the strings at the pegs of the cross-bar; brown for the lines on the arm and on the sleeve, for the short strokes on the phiale, for the stripe on the chiton half-way down the shank, for the patterns on the cithara-cloth and the esses on the band which serves as a support for the left hand. The figure is contoured with relief-lines. Very similar Apollos appear on the large neck-amphora in Providence from which the painter has been given his name (<title>CV.</title> pl. 18: <title>ARV.</title> p. 431 no. 1), on his pelike in the Cabinet des Médailles (<title>Annali</title> 1833 pll.

J.</title> 8 p. 26: A, Apollo; B, Artemis).</p>

<p>The pattern-work is conventional; the palmettes on the shoulder are of the usual lekythos-type.</p>

<p>The goddess stands in almost the same attitude as Apollo on the last lekythos, holding her helmet out in her right hand, and with her left grasping her spear near the top. She wears a chiton, a himation draped in the 'Ionic' fashion and passing over the left shoulder, the aegis, earring, bracelets. The fringed head-band is set in front with leaves, perhaps of gold. The gorgoneion shows tongue but no teeth. The forehead of the goddess is missing, the left elbow and upper arm, and the end of the mass of hair. The figure is fully contoured with relief-lines. The inner line of the hair-contour is in relief. The brown lines are seen in the reproduction, except those on the sleeves.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The Providence Painter has other bare-headed Athenas, but none in this attitude, standing bare-headed with the helmet in one hand and the spear in the other. This conception of the goddess, however, is frequent in the late archaic and early classic periods, and culminates, as is well known, in a masterpiece of sculpture, the Dresden-Bologna Athena, the Lemnia, it may be, of Pheidias. This was shown by Furtwängler (<title>Mast.</title> pp. 13-17), who also noticed that once the conception had found full expression in the great bronze statue, it lost its popularity elsewhere, and is rarely found on later <pb xml:id="ii.43" n="43"/> vases or in other works of art.<note anchored="true" n="ii.43.1"><p>The Lansdowne Relief (<title>Burl.

<p>A young man stands with left leg frontal, right leg in profile, holding a flower-crowned sceptre in his right hand near the top, and looking towards a woman whom he takes by the wrist to lead her forward. His head is wreathed, and he wears a himation; she a chiton with kolpos, and over it, shawl-wise, a himation which veils the back of her head. The front of a metal head-band is preserved, the upper part of it notched or embattled. The figures are contoured with relief-lines; the outer line of the woman's hair-reserve, above the head-band, is also a relief-line. 'The brown lines on the body of the youth, for his whisker, for the woman's nostril, and in her kolpos, hardly come out in the photograph. Her eye is dot-and-circle.</p>

<p>The various kinds of group, not always easy to interpret exactly, in which a man or youth leads a woman by the hand, have been studied by Massow (<title>AM.</title> 41 pp. 58-62 and 64-5) and Miss Haspels (<title>BCH.</title> 1930 pp. 15-23). Our group is one of the many representing bride and bridegroom. In such scenes on Attic loutrophoroi, the pair move to right; but elsewhere the direction is often leftward as here: for example, on a cup by Euphronios in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 176" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 176</rs>: Langlotz pl. 8: <title>ARV.</title> p. 18 no. 15), on a cup by the Amymone Painter in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 2530" type="Vase">Berlin 2530</rs>: Stackelberg pl. 42: <title>ARV.</title> p. 551 no. 17), on an oinochoe in Tübingen (<rs key="Tbingen E 174" type="Vase">Tübingen E 174</rs>: Watzinger pl. 38). The free hand of the bridegroom is usually empty: but on a white pyxis by the Splanchnopt Painter in London he carries a stick (Murray <title>WAV.</title> pl. 20: <title>ARV.</title> p. 592 no. 52); Herakles at his wedding retains his <pb xml:id="ii.44" n="44"/> club (pyxis in Philadelphia, <title>Burl. Cat. 1903</title> pl. 96, I 74, <title>Mus. J.</title> 7 pp. 270 and 272; pyxis in the collection of Prof. Andreas Alföldi, Budapest, <title>Corolla Curtius</title> pll. 52-3); while on a cup in the Louvre, <rs key="Louvre G 265" type="Vase">Louvre G 265</rs>, by the Painter of Louvre G 265 (Pottier pl. 133: <title>ARV.</title> p. 273, middle, no. 1), and on a nuptial lebes, from the Mannerist Group, in Athens (Athens 1172: Collignon and Couve pl. 43, 1229: <title>ARV.</title> p. 397 no. 31) the bridegroom holds a sceptre as on our lekythos; perhaps also on the oinochoe, already quoted, in Tübingen (<rs key="Tbingen E 174" type="Vase">Tübingen E 174</rs>: Watzinger pl. 38).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The figures on our lekythos can hardly be simple bride and bridegroom, as they doubtless are on the loutrophoroi: they must be a particular pair. At first I called them Menelaos and Helen (<title>VA.</title> p. 76); later, Paris and Helen (<title>Att. V.</title> p. 135; <title>ARV.</title> p. 434), thinking not of the departure from the house of Menelaos, but of the wedding at Troy, which is represented, in a more elaborate form, on a Middle Corinthian column-krater in New York (<title>Bull. Metr.</title> 23 pp. 48-9, Alexander: Payne <title>NC.</title> pl. 33, 5 and p. 318 no. 1187: see also <title>AJA</title> 1950 p. 310. Peleus and Thetis would also be possible. Menelaos and Helen, however, are the most likely. The clue is given by the Brygos Painter's lekythos in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 2205" type="Vase">Berlin 2205</rs>: Millingen <title>AUM.</title> 1 pl. 32; Neugebauer pl. 54, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 255 no. 153), where the name is inscribed, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*N*E*L*E*O*S</foreign>. There is a difference: the Brygan youth wears a helmet and greaves as well as a himation, and holds a spear instead of a sceptre. He may be thought of as leading Helen away after the award, rather than at the actual wedding. That Menelaos might appear at his wedding in civilian costume can be shown, if necessary, from a later version of the same subject, on the oinochoe in Tübingen, of about 400 B.C., mentioned twice already (<rs key="Tbingen E 174" type="Vase">Tübingen E 174</rs>: Watzinger pl. 38): the presence of a kalathiskos-dancer, as Watzinger observed, shows that the Tübingen couple are Menelaos and Helen.</p>

<p>Menelaos as the fortunate suitor is depicted on a footed alabastron, Apulian of A.P. style, in Boston (<rs key="Boston 00.360" type="Vase">Boston 00.360</rs>: described in <title>Annual Report</title> 1900 p. 470): the young hero sits to left, leaning on his stick, his head in three-quarter view to right; Helen approaches him, to left, her himation veiling the back of her head, with a mirror in her hand; Eros flies down towards Menelaos with a wreath; behind him a woman plays the harp: inscriptions <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*N*E*L*A*O*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E*L*E*N*A</foreign>. On B, a seated youth, and a woman with a pair of phialai and a fan.<note anchored="true" n="ii.44.1"><p>The wooing is shown on an Etruscan mirror in Naples (Gerhard <title>ES.</title> pl. 197; <title>JHS.</title> 69 p. 7 fig. 5): <title>Menle</title>, a youth in armour, offers <title>Elina</title> a necklace; both are seated, and <title>Turan</title> stands between them.</p></note></p>

<p>The wedding of Menelaos was treated by Stesichorus; the gathering of Helen's suitors is described in fragments of the Hesiodean <title>Catalogues</title> (94-6 Rz.), and this was doubtless followed by an account of the wedding.</p>

I have tried to show that the woman is Thetis (see <ref target="ii.68" n="U">ii pp. 68-9</ref>).

<p>What remains is the upper part of a king or god, dressed in chiton and himation, a circlet round the head. The contours are in relief-lines.

The inscription, in red, on the right, is <foreign xml:lang="greek">...]*O*N*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.

<p>In <title>Att. V.</title> p. 133 I counted this as part of a Nolan amphora. Later I doubted, because of the incurve at the upper part of the fragment: but Dietrich von Bothmer has shown me that this amount of incurve is not impossible in the shape.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have repeated some passages from my previous accounts of the vase (<title>JHS.</title> 32 p. 354; <title>VA.</title> pp. 113-14; and especially <title>Panm.</title> pp. 9-11 and 20). See also the first publication, by Hauser, in FR. ii pp. 289-96; Zahn in <title>BPW.</title> 1910 pp. 910-11; Pfuhl pp. 487-8; and especially Jacobsthal <title>Aktaions Tod</title> p. 10.</p>

<p>The picture on the obverse is the Death of Actaeon. Actaeon was the Theban hunter who incurred the wrath of Artemis, and his hounds took him for a stag and tore him to pieces. The later story, that Artemis hated him because he had seen her naked, familiar to the moderns and already to Callimachus, was unknown to the Pan Painter: the earlier story was that Zeus was angry with Actaeon for wooing Semele, and ordered Artemis to slay him. There are many ancient pictures of Actaeon's death, but this one stands alone. Other artists showed Actaeon attacked, but defending himself — fleeing, or (if falling), struggling or laying about him; and Artemis standing solemn by. The Pan Painter has quickened the movement and subtilized the contrast. The design is V-shaped. The two figures burst apart as if from an explosion at the base of the vase. Actaeon is neither fleeing nor struggling: he is collapsing utterly, he is dying. From the waist down he is already lifeless. Artemis turns towards Actaeon as she flies past him, and holds an arrow on her bow. He cries, he flings his arms out, he is dead. 'The feeling for <emph>great gesture</emph> appears here for the first time. That the motive may tell with its full force, the shanks, which would impair the leading lines of the composition, are almost foreshortened away. The mantle fills the void between left arm and torso, so that the body of Actaeon contracts to a compact mass, a mountain-block hurled to earth by divine power.' So Hauser: he speaks of a rock; but there is another image that would be no less apt. This is not the first falling or dying figure in Greek art: but it is the first that brings to mind the Homeric simile: 'He fell as falls an oak, or a white poplar, or a tall pine':</p>

<p>The Pan Painter likes out-of-the-way subjects; and the picture on the other side of the vase is unique. The god Pan is almost unknown in Attic art before the Persian wars: he had ground for complaining to Philippides, on the eve of Marathon, that the Athenians neglected him. After the Persian wars Pan became popular at Athens: but not in this context: only here is he seen pursuing a boy. A young goatherd, in country garb — goat-skin, sheepskin cap, stockings, whip — is hotly pursued by the goat-god; and at the rock-seat, a third, strange person, the wooden herm-like image of some small Priapos-like deity, views the scene with a round, bewildered eye.</p>

<p>In the drawing, a blend of late-archaic daintiness and early-classic grandeur; the pathos of the early-classic period but not its &emacr;thos; swift, nay explosive movement; ravishing elegance; a darting, fastidious touch; piquant contrasts, deliberate and amusing disproportions — small things made larger, large things smaller, than one expects; round heads with tiny nose and delicate nostril but big chin and bull neck; wasp waist but sturdy thighs; powerful arms but tapering fingers; the bow very long, the quiver very <pb xml:id="ii.47" n="47"/> thin; the hounds lilliputian; Pan's face small between long beard and long horns. The forms, even more than in most vase-painters, approximated to geometrical shapes, with a special fondness for circle and arc (even the irregularities of the rock are fully patternized); yet packed with expression, and tense with life.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A. On the story of Actaeon, and the representations, see Eduard Schwartz in <title>Annali</title> 1882 pp. 290-9, Hauser in FR. ii pp. 289-96, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff <title>Hellenistische Dichtung</title> ii, 23, Jacobsthal <title>Aktaions Tod</title>; and below, <ref target="ii.83" n="U">ii pp. 83-6</ref>. In our vase, Artemis wears a chiton, with kolpos; a himation of 'Ionic' fashion, passing over the right shoulder; a fawnskin, which includes the head of the animal; and round earrings. A long thin quiver is at her back. Her long hair is parted in the middle and passed through a circlet, then falls over the shoulders, where the ends are packed into a bag. There are half a dozen incised lines on the hair in front of the ear. On the coiffure see Hauser in FR. ii p. 291 and Studniczka in <title>Jb.</title> 26 pp. 182-3, on the circlet Rumpf <title>Tettix</title> (from <title>Symbola Coloniensia</title>) p. 95. The goddess holds an arrow on her bow, and a second arrow in her left hand: it will not be necessary to shoot.<note anchored="true" n="ii.47.1"><p>On the bow, arrows, and draw see Lorimer <title>Homer and the Monuments</title> p. 304: According to Miss Lorimer 'the elegant but ineffectual hold of Artemis is possibly a tribute to her sex': but Artemis, as was said above, is threatening rather than drawing.</p></note> The left forefinger is extended, but does not show clearly in the photograph. The head of the spare arrow has disappeared in a fracture, but the contour-stripe shows where it was. The oval cut in the middle of the bow, to fit the hand, is indicated, and the tendril decoration above and below the cut. There are some repainted fractures in the skirt, especially above and below the left ankle, and the outer line of the ankle is missing. The treatment of the folds in the skirt recalls the Thetis side of the bell-krater by the Oreithyia Painter in Palermo (Politi <title>Cinque vasi di premio</title> pll. 7-8; <title>CV.</title> pll. 35-7: <title>ARV.</title> p. 325 no. 5). The beauty of the smooth, rounded forehead, the eye, the nose, the mouth, is coarsened in Reichhold's drawings, and there are a good many inaccuracies of detail. On the other hand the photographs hardly show the delicate nostril and the very thin relief-line, modelling the cheek, at the corner of the mouth. Much of the contour of the figure is without relief-line, and even the face has none except for the lower lip and the lower edge of the nose. The front of the neck, and the part of the jaw to the left of it, were done in thin brown lines, and afterwards lined in with relief. The pelt is washed with brown. Not all the brown lines on the chiton appear in the photographs.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Actaeon wears a chlamys and sandals (no doubt with stockings). His sword in its sheath hangs from a baldric. The long hair is parted in the middle, with thick locks hanging in front of the ear. Hauser thought there was something ominous in the looseness of the hair (FR. ii p. 292): but what of Apollo's hair on the calyx-krater by the Aegisthus Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 164" type="Vase">Louvre G 164</rs>; <title>Mon.</title> 1856 pl. 11; FR. pl. 164; <title>CV.</title> pll. 10-11: <title>ARV.</title> p. 330 no. 1)? The whisker is in brown. A repainted crack passes through belly and locks, and part of the navel is missing. The contour of the figure, including the face, is in relief-lines, except for the right forearm and hand, the chlamys, the left forearm and most of the hand. The navel is in black, but the navel-pubes line is brown, not black as in Reichhold's drawing. The brown lines on the body do not all come out in the photograph, and the fine relief-lines of the nostril and the corner of the mouth are not very clear. The upper part of the cornea is withdrawn beneath the upper lid: this is traditional in Greek art for persons who have received a deadly hurt. According to Reichhold the tongue is indicated by a relief-line: but this is not so. Reichhold has again coarsened the face. The sword-hilt is washed with brown. All four hounds wear collars. The hound biting the throat has the head frontal. Reichhold has darkened the marks on its face. The eye, muzzle, and tail of the uppermost hound have suffered.</p>

<p>We have another picture of the Death of Actaeon by the Pan Painter on a fragmentary volute-krater, earlier than our vase, in Athens, from the Acropolis (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 760" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 760</rs>: Jacobsthal <title>Aktaions Tod</title> p. 7; <title>Panm.</title> pl. 12, 2; Langlotz pl. 65: <title>ARV.</title> p. 362 no. 16). The treatment is different, and less unusual, though very individual. Actaeon, attacked by his hounds, rushes away from us, looking round at Artemis, his arms extended, helpless, the right arm in entreaty: as on the Boston vase, he neither struggles nor tries to defend himself. <pb xml:id="ii.48" n="48"/> The goddess fronts us, like a column, her head turned towards Actaeon: her right arm is stretched out horizontally, urging the hounds on; the horizontal is emphasized by the bow held in the other hand, the perpendicular of her body by the pattern-band from the waist down and the perpendicular quiver at her back. Actaeon is dressed, as nowhere else, in a deerskin fitting close to his trunk, thighs, and arms, with the head (not merely the scalp) forming a sort of cap: the painter has had Herakles' lionskin in his mind, but still more Dolon's wolfskin coat: see the cup by the Panaitios Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<title>WV.</title> 5  pl. 5, 1, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> i p. 395: <title>ARV.</title> p. 215 no. 27); and the cup by the Dokimasia Painter in Leningrad (<title>Annali</title> 1875 pl. Q, 1-2 and pl. R, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 271 no. 12), where the attitude of the Dolon in one of the two pictures recalls our Actaeon. By giving Actaeon this strange costume the Pan Painter is explaining how the hounds came to take their master for a stag. This is not the same notion as in Stesichorus, but it is akin: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Sthsi/xoros de\ o( *(Imerai=os e)/grayen e)la/fou peribalei=n de/rma *)Aktai/wni th\n qeo/n</foreign> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.2.3">Paus. 9.2.3</bibl>: see Jacobsthal <title>Akt.</title> p. 4). The hounds are small, as in the Boston vase; and again one of them is at Actaeon's throat.</p>

<p>B. On the various early representations of Pan see Hartwig in <title>RM.</title> pp. 89-101, Hauser in FR. ii pp. 294-5, Brommer <title>Satyroi</title> pp. 10-19 and 49-51 and in <title>Anz.</title> 1938 pp. 375-82, Crome in <title>A.M.</title> 64 pp. 120-4, Herbig <title>Pan</title>. Here he has goat's head, neck, and horns, goat's hooves, and a small goat's tail, is otherwise human. The body is perfectly formed and proportioned, and the animal head has nobility: there is no other Pan in which the god shows so clearly through the goat.</p>

<p>In the goatherd, relief-lines contour the forehead and chin, the right thumb, the lower line of the right upper arm, the right shoulder, the lower line of the right thigh; in Pan, forehead and nose, parts of the hands, the penis, the back and buttocks, the right thigh and the front line of the left. Brown inner markings.</p>

<p>The goatherd wears a chitoniskos, a goatskin, a sheepskin hat, shoes and stockings. The chiton is <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/cwmos</foreign>, leaves the right shoulder bare. It is twisted up into the girdle in front: Hauser conjectures that the boy has his supper in this part of his chiton (FR. ii p. 290), but it is improbable that Apollo has his supper in his chiton on the Siphnian frieze, although it is twisted up in much the same manner. The boy's left hand is under the goatskin and draws it tight lest Pan should catch him by the flying end. Once more Reichhold has not got the face quite right.</p>

<p>A goatskin and a hat of the same type as this are worn, with or without a chiton, on a good many vases of this period. Here are some examples:</p>

</list>
<p>To these Attic figures, all from the end of the archaic period or the early classic, add the guard of 'Antigone' on an Italiote phlyax-vase in the Mustilli collection at S. Agata de' Goti (Gerhard <title>AB.</title> pl. 73, whence Bieber <title>Denkmäler zum Theaterwesen</title> p. 147).</p>

<p>Some of the youths and men in this attire are light-armed warriors, others hunters, herds, or countrymen: that our youth is a goatherd is made likely by the whip in his hand: the goatherd on the black-figured kyathos signed by Theozotos in the Louvre holds a whip (<rs key="Louvre F 69" type="Vase">Louvre F 69</rs>: <title>WV.</title> 1888 pl. 1, 9-10, whence Hoppin <title>Bf.</title> 353). The hat is nowhere so plainly of sheepskin as here; it usually seems to be of goatskin; the neatherd on the New York hoof-vase wears a goatskin hat with the same bold black markings as the skin cloak on the cup by the Briseis Painter (no. 6).</p>

<p>The rock is stylized in the same manner as all the painter's rocks (<title>JHS.</title> 32 p. 368). Outside his work, a very similar stylization occurs on a column-krater, in the manner of Myson (<title>ARV.</title> p. 172 no. 10), in the Guthmann collection at Mittelschreiberhau (Neugebauer <title>Antiken in deutschem Privatbesitz</title> pl. 69): much of the rock there is repainted, but enough remains to show the treatment. It will be remembered that the Pan Painter was a pupil of Myson.</p>

<p>Hauser calls the god Priapos: this would be far the earliest trace of him in Attica, except that Priapos is the name of an Attic potter who worked in the third quarter of the sixth century (<title>BSA.</title> 29 pp. 202-4; <title>JHS.</title> 52 pp. 201 and 203). Herter more plausibly takes him for one of those indigenous godlets who were afterwards confused or identified with Priapos (<title>De dis Atticis Priapi similibus</title> pp. 16-19); so also Miss Goldman (<title>AJA.</title> 1942 p. 60). Ludwig Curtius, and Lullies (<title>Die Typen der antiken Herme</title> p. 63), think it is Hermes: and this seems to me an equally probable explanation: there must have been many artless wooden herms in the Attic country, some earlier than the Hipparchean marble ones, some later:<note anchored="true" n="ii.49.1"><p>See also Lullies 'Hermenfragen' in <title>Würzburger Jahrbücher</title> 4 (1949-50) pp. 126-39.</p></note> these quaint objects would naturally take the Pan Painter's fancy, and he has given his own more subtle version of them.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The images most like ours are on a red-figured lekythos, not much later, in Athens (<rs key="Athens 12119" type="Vase">Athens 12119</rs>: <title>Eph.</title> 1908 p. 153 and pl. 8), already adduced by Hauser, where a hunter has plucked a sprig and is offering it to the god: on a Boeotian black-figured skyphos of the Cabirion class in Athens (Wolters and Bruns <title>Kabirenheiligtum</title> pl. 33, 2 and pl. 51, 4); and on the red-figured skyphos <rs key="Tbingen F 2" type="Vase">Tübingen F 2</rs> (Watzinger pl. 41, whence Lullies <title>Typen</title> pl. 8, 2 and Nilsson <title>Geschichte der griechischen Religion</title> i pl. 33, 1): this, though often called Boeotian, is Attic work of about 425 B.C.: a skyphos, from Tithorea, in Oxford, <rs key="Oxford 1934.339" type="Vase">Oxford 1934.339</rs>, resembles it in style. Nilsson follows Watzinger in naming the Tübingen idol Priapos; it and the Athens figure are more probably either a 'pre-Priapos' or quite possibly Hermes. Such figures recall Horace's (<title>S.</title> 1, 8, 1):</p>

<p>Another vase that the Boston picture brings to mind is a small pelike in Compiègne (<rs key="Compigne 970" type="Vase">Compiègne 970</rs>: Micali <title>St.</title> pl. 96, 3; <title>CV.</title> pl. 17, 1-2): Pan, holding a club, stands in front of a herm set on a rock: if my memory serves me the herm is of very rude cut. A much later picture that recalls ours in a more general way is on the Lloyd vase, an Italiote calyx-krater of the fourth century in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 1937.283" type="Vase">Oxford 1937.283</rs>: <title>JHS.</title> 63 pl. 1, 1 and pll. 2-3, with p. 93): young satyrs attack a pair of maenads, while Pan — or a statue of Pan ? — looks on.</p>

<p>We have spoken of a goatherd, without attempting to name him; yet, as Curtius has recently pointed out (<title>Jh.</title> 38 p. 14) it is not very likely that this is just any goatherd: it should be a particular one. Hauser suggested (in FR. ii p. 294) that it might be Daphnis, who figured in a poem by one of the Stesichoroi; but did not insist. Eduard Fraenkel reminds me that Daphnis, Pan, Priapos occur together in <bibl>Theocritus (<title>Epigr.</title> 3</bibl>: 'in picturam aut anaglyphum', Wilamowitz), and in circumstances that recall our vase:</p>
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>eu(/deis ... *Da/fni ...</l>

<p>'The young goatherd on the vase may have been asleep a moment before, exactly like the ideal shepherd, Daphnis.'<note anchored="true"><p>P. 50: Andrew Gow writes: 'Daphnis is not a goat-herd but par excellence <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( bouko/los</foreign>. Would he have a whip therefore? Cattle seem to be directed by missiles — sticks or stones: see <bibl n="Hom. Il. 23.845">Hom. Il. 23.845</bibl>, Aratus 112, and Gow on <bibl n="Thuc. 4.49">Thuc. 4.49</bibl>.'</p></note></p>

<p>There are two varieties of bell-krater. The less common variety, to which our vase belongs, has solid lugs instead of handles. This variety perhaps began before the other: at least the four bell-kraters decorated by the Berlin Painter between 490 and 480 (<title>ARV.</title> p. 137 nos. 95-8) are the earliest Attic bell-kraters extant. There may have been earlier bell-kraters: a very early red-figured fragment by the Hischylos Painter in the Villa Giulia (<title>ARV.</title> p. 57 no. 5), of about 530-525, and a fragment by the Dikaios Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 387" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 387</rs>: <title>Archiv für die Geschichte der Medizin</title>, 3, 1909, p. 38, fig. 5), seem from the curve to be parts of bell-kraters, whether handled or lugged. The lugged bell-krater differs from the handled in other respects as well: the mouth has a simpler form; and as to the foot, when it acquires one (the earliest have none), H. R. W. Smith rightly speaks of 'a dogged attempt, down to the end of the fifth century, to keep the lugged krater distinct' in this respect 'from its upstart competitor' (<title>CV.</title> San Francisco p. 45). There is a certain amount of hybridization: as early as 460, a lugged krater by the Painter of the Yale Oinochoe, in Leningrad, borrows mouth and foot from the other variety (<rs key="Leningrad 777" type="Vase">Leningrad 777</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 329 no. 11).

<p>The Pan Painter has left another lugged bell-krater, <rs key="Palermo 778" type="Vase">Palermo 778</rs> (Politi <title>Cinque vasi di premio</title> pll. 2-3, whence Hartwig p. 471; <title>Panm.</title> pll. 31-2 and pl. 27, 2; <title>CV.</title> pl. 34: <title>ARV.</title> p. 361 no. 2): later, and fine, but not comparable to the Boston vase. The foot is different: it is of double-ogee form, and has a base-fillet (the retouched photographs in the Corpus are misleading). <rs key="Louvre G 368" type="Vase">Louvre G 368</rs>, by the Painter of the Yale Oinochoe, has a similar foot (<title>CV.</title> d pl. 8, 2-3 and pl. 11, 2: phot. Alinari 23683: <title>ARV.</title> p. 329 no. 10). The Boston foot is more like that of a vase in the De Young Museum, San Francisco (<title>CV.</title> pl. 22, 1).</p>

<p>Several vases by the Pan Painter have been published or republished since the list in <title>ARV.</title> pp. 361-8 and 959: A of no. 11 bis in Trendall and Stuart <title>Handbook to the Nicholson Museum</title> 2 p. 295; no. 27 in Bloesch <title>Antike Kunst in der Schweiz</title>, pll. 30-1, pl. 1, 2 and p. 63; no. 35 in <title>CV.</title> Madrid pl. 20, 2 and pl. 24, 3; no. 44 ibid. pl. 9, 3; no. 53 bis in <title>CV.</title> San Francisco pl. 15, 2 and pl. 16, 2 (Gargiulo <title>Cenni sulla maniera di rinvenire i vasi fittili italo-greci</title> pl. 7, 19 is perhaps an inaccurate reproduction of this vase); no. 58 in <title>Classical Studies presented to Edward Capps</title> p. 244 fig. 2; no. 60 in Feytmans <title>Les Vases grecs de la Bibliothèque Royale de Belgique</title> pll. 23-4; no. 74 in <title>CV.</title> Munich pl. 86, 9-10 and pl. 92, 6; no. 81 in <title>JHS.</title> 68 p. 27 fig. 2; no. 89 in <title>CV.</title> Vienna University pl. 10, 18 (from Orvieto). Add two fragments (of a volute-krater or a stamnos?) in the <pb xml:id="ii.51" n="51"/> Louvre (on one, head and breast of a youth facing left; on the other, head and breast of a youth to right); a lekythos in Providence, <rs key="RISD 35.708" type="Vase">RISD 35.708</rs> (<title>Cl. St. Capps</title> p. 242 fig. 1), a fragment, from Athens, in Athens (<title>BCH.</title> 1940-1 pl. 10, 4), a fragment in the Louvre (middle of Triptolemos, arm of Demeter), and another also in the Louvre (Dionysos with kantharos and ivy, satyr dancing). No. 26, as Dietrich von Bothmer tells me, is not in the Louvre but in the Museum of Laon. No. 38, I learn from H. R. W. Smith, is now in the Museum at Houston, Texas (<rs key="Houston 37.10" type="Vase">Houston 37.10</rs>). No. 36, the Nolan amphora in Palermo, should be removed from the list: it is by the Alkimachos Painter, as I had already suggested in <title>Att. V.</title> p. 105. No. 59 bis should be placed among the vases in the manner of the painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 369): no. 1 in that list, which resembles it, is lent to the Los Angeles Museum by Mr. Victor Merlo (A, Merlo <title>The Gallery of Classical Art: the Victor Merlo Collection. Los Angeles Museum mcmxxxii</title> p. 15). It is not so close to the painter as I had thought. No. 4 in the 'manner' list should be withdrawn. No. 5 is now published by Curtius in <title>Jh.</title> 38 pp. 1-2.</p>

<p>This is an unusually small Nolan amphora: <rs key="Naples 3137" type="Vase">Naples 3137</rs>, one of the Berlin Painter's earliest Nolans, is smaller (height 0.233: <title>ARV.</title> p. 135 no. 48); some of the Nolans by the Painter of <rs key="London E 342" type="Vase">London E 342</rs> and his companions are also small, but they are later and of very poor quality. A band of floral pattern, palmettes sideways, takes the place of the more usual maeander below the pictures. The handle-palmettes have relief-contour, and the petals are ribbed. The figures on A are contoured with relief-lines; there is little relief-contour on B — for face, neck, and right shoulder only. Brown lines on the arms in A, and raised dots for the forehead-hair. Red for wreaths. Dietrich von Bothmer tells me that there are two 'ghosts' (see <ref target="ii.55" n="U">ii p. 55</ref>): to left of Zeus, upright, part of a palmette-strip like that below the figures; to left of the boy on B, a piece of maeander, diagonal.</p>

<p>'Zeus pursuing Ganymede' is a favourite subject in the late archaic and early classic periods: see G. Koerte in <title>Annali</title> 1876 pp. 49-62; Paul Friedländer in Pauly-Wissowa s.v. Ganymedes; Buschor in FR. iii p. 254; <title>Panm.</title> p. 14; Kunze <title>Zeus und Ganymedes</title>; <title>EVP.</title> index, p. 313. The Pan Painter himself has left three pictures of it. On the Boston vase Zeus is in the act of laying hand on Ganymede. He holds a sceptre in his left hand and is dressed in a himation: Ganymede also wears a himation, and holds hoop and hoop-stick. Both have long hair and are wreathed. On the reverse, a boy, dressed in a himation, and wreathed, runs off, looking round, with a piece of meat, leg and side of an animal, in his left hand: he may be an older companion of Ganymede. On an unpublished lekythos, from Novoli, in Taranto (<title>ARV.</title> p. 366 no. 59) Ganymede runs to left, his left leg frontal, with hoop and hoop-stick in his left hand, and looks round at Zeus, who grasps him with his right hand and holds the sceptre in his left; both wear wraps only. On the ground, to left of Ganymede, is his pet cock, which he has let fall. Inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The third vase is an oinochoe in New York (<title>AJA</title> 1926 p. 36; <title>Panm.</title> pl. 18, 2; Richter and Hall pl. 69, 65 and pl. 177, 65: <title>ARV.</title> p. 367 no. 76): Ganymede alone is represented, wreathed, and wearing the himation (drawn much as in the Boston picture); as he runs he holds not only hoop and hoop-stick, but also the cock.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 51, no. 95.

<p>We have counted the <emph>single</emph> figures of a boy running, looking back, with cock and hoop, as meant for Ganymede: on the Pan Painter's oinochoe in New York, and on the Chicago standlet. So they probably are: but it should be said that the pursuer of such figures is not always Zeus: on a pelike by the Syleus Painter in the Faina collection at Orvieto it is a youth (A, phot. Alinari 32491, whence Zadoks-Jitta p. 87, 11 and Tarchi pl. 121, 4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 165 no. 17), and on a psykter by the Painter of the Yale lekythos in Berlin it is Eros (<rs key="Berlin 3407" type="Vase">Berlin 3407</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 444 no. 15). G. Koerte thought that the youth on the interior of a cup formerly in the collection of Simmaco Doria was Ganymede (Helbig in <title>Bull.</title> 1865 p. 163: Koerte in <title>Annali</title> 1876 p. 163): but there is no reason to think so. The cup is now in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 271" type="Vase">Louvre G 271</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 303, Makron no. 23). The bird is a dove not a cock. The provenience may now be added, Capua.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Kunze thinks that the cock on these vases is a present from Zeus (<title>Zeus und Ganymedes</title> p. 38, middle; see also his <title>Olympische Forschungen</title> ii p. 42). Must this be so? Ganymede was a king's son, and doubtless received plenty of playthings from the family, was not dependent on well-to-do suitors. Or is the hoop, too, a present from Zeus? The piece of meat held by the boy on the reverse need not be a gift either.</p>

<p>On a neck-amphora, close to the Alkimachos Painter, in Leningrad, a boy with a hoop is pursued by Hermes (<rs key="Leningrad 611" type="Vase">Leningrad 611</rs>: A, Waldhauer <title>Antichniya raspisniya Vazi</title> fig. 15: <title>ARV.</title> p. 358 no. 1). The boy is possibly Ganymede, in another version of the story. The Basseggio stamnos by Hermonax is difficult (<title>B.Ap.</title> 22, 84: <title>ARV.</title> p. 318 no. 14): for in the continuous picture that runs right round the vase, while Zeus pursues Ganymede, Hermes lays hands on another youth. Buschor (in FR. iii p. 254) finds Ganymede in two figures which I take for Paris: on a neck-amphora by the Oionokles Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 373" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 373</rs>: de Ridder p. 273 and pl. 12: <title>ARV.</title> p. 439 no. 29) and on a Nolan amphora by the Sabouroff Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 330" type="Vase">London E 330</rs>: <title>Mon.</title> 1 pl. 5 fig. 1; A, <title>El.</title> 2 pl. 51; <title>CV.</title> pl. 63, 3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 559 no. 69). The youth pursued by Hermes on a cup by the Penthesilea Painter formerly in the Vitet collection (<title>El.</title> 2 pl. 53, whence Overbeck <title>KM.</title> pl. 24, 17: <title>ARV.</title> p. 584 no. 21) may also be Paris.</p>

<p>Lastly, to return to the neck-amphora in Leningrad: in the unique picture on the other side of the vase Hermes stands facing a boy who holds a sceptre and looks down (Waldhauer <title>K.O.</title> pl. 10 fig. 8): the boy is Paris rather than Ganymede. Paris often has a sceptre in pictures of the Judgement: bf. amphora in Lyons, Group of London B 76; bf. neck-amphora by the Antimenes Painter in Würzburg (<rs key="Wrzburg 186" type="Vase">Würzburg 186</rs>: Langlotz pl. 57); bf. neck-amphora in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 510" type="Vase">Oxford 510</rs>: Gerhard <title>AV.</title> pl. 172; <title>JHS.</title> 24 pp. 299-300); bf. neck-amphora in London (<rs key="London B 236" type="Vase">London B 236</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 57, 4), Group of Würzburg 189; bf. neck-amphora in Munich (<rs key="Munich 1544" type="Vase">Munich 1544</rs>, J. 1250); bf. amphora in Copenhagen, Thorvaldsen Museum; bf. hydria in Bristol <pb xml:id="ii.53" n="53"/> (<rs key="Bristol H 801" type="Vase">Bristol H 801</rs>: the Judgement is on the shoulder; the chief picture represents Memnon with three negro attendants); bf. lekythos by the Edinburgh Painter in Taranto (Haspels <title>ABL.</title> p. 217 no. 32); rf. cup by the Briseis Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 151" type="Vase">Louvre G 151</rs>: Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> i p. 116; Pottier pl. 120: <title>ARV.</title> p. 268 no. 22), rf. stamnos by the Syleus Painter in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 2182" type="Vase">Berlin 2182</rs>: <title>AZ.</title> 1883 pl. 15; <title>Jb.</title> 31 p. 203: <title>ARV.</title> p. 166 no. 27); lost rf. lekythos (Welcker <title>A.D.</title> pl.

<p>An early representation of Zeus and Ganymede, though not in the form of a pursuit, is on a small black-figured amphora with Greek inscription, or inscription in an alphabet that may be Greek, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*G*A*N*U*M*E*D*E*M</foreign>, in Munich (<rs key="Munich 834" type="Vase">Munich 834</rs>: Sieveking and Hackl pl. 33 and pp. 95-6). The only provenience given by Hackl is 'Italy', but since speaking of it in <title>EVP.</title> (pp. 57 and 295) I find it described by Heydemann in <title>Bull.</title> 1869 p. 146 no. 3: it was then at Naples in the Torrusio collection and was therefore found at Nola. This does not tell us where the vase was made but it detaches it from Etruria and Latium; it may be Campanian.<note anchored="true" n="ii.53.1"><p>The woman crowning Ganymede is no doubt Hera, as Hackl says. Hera gives Ganymede a crown in token of good will, just as Amphitrite crowns Theseus in Bacchylides (<bibl n="Bacchyl. 17.113-16">Bacchyl. 17.113-16</bibl>).</p></note> On Etruscan Ganymedes see <title>EVP.</title>, index.</p>

<p>Duhn has left a circumstantial account of the grave in which the Boston vase was found (<title>RM.</title> 2 pp. 236-41). It was a thick-sided stone box (cubo di tufo) consisting of two blocks placed one on top of the other, a cavity in the one corresponding to a cavity in the other. Inside, the box was painted red. It contained, first, a bronze dinos of archaic Campanian style with a statuette of a naked youth on the lid and statuettes of horses on the rim (ibid. p. 237 and p. 238 figs. 5-6): no. 14 in Riis's list, <title>From the Coll.</title> 2 p. 157. This in its turn contained the ashes of the dead, and a black squat lekythos roughly reeded (<title>RM.</title> 2 p. 238 fig. 4). In each corner of the receptacle there stood a clay vase: in one corner, the Boston Nolan; in the second, a small oinochoe or mug 'blackened as if by smoke' (ibid. p. 240 fig. 12); in the third, a skyphos covered with lustrous black glaze (ibid. fig. 11); in the fourth, a janiform head-kantharos — two archaic or sub-archaic female heads (ibid. fig. 10). Since the head-vase is 'of excellent make' it is no doubt Attic. I confess to being a little surprised by the other three vases: I have only the small cuts to go by, but I should have guessed that the squat lekythos and the little mug with the ring-handle were Campanian of the fourth century, and that the skyphos was not earlier than the late fifth.</p>

<p>Height 0.307. The drawings are by Caskey. One figure from A, <title>VA.</title> p. 115; A, <title>International Studio</title> 88 (Dec. 1927) p. 71, above, r. (D. C.

About 470-460 B.C., by the Pan Painter (<title>VA.</title> p. 115; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 102 no. 22; <title>Panm.</title> p. 22 no. 27; <title>ARV.</title> p. 364 no. 33).</p>

<p>The victorious athlete is a sturdy boy, planted firmly on his feet, with the left leg frontal; wreathed, and holding three sprigs, such as were given to victors, in each hand. He looks towards a man, dressed in a himation, and wreathed, who stands in the same position, with the right leg frontal, but the feet not so far apart and the head turned to right and raised: he holds a pronged wand in his right hand and a walking-stick in his left. He may be about to announce the victory, as in other pictures resembling this: see <title>CV.</title> Oxford, on pl. 49, 6, and <title>Panm.</title> p. 14 note 28; add the bell-krater by the Nikias Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London 98.7-16.6" type="Vase">London 98.7-16.6</rs>: Fröhner <title>Coll. Tyszkiewicz</title> pl. 35, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> ii p. 219: <title>ARV.</title> p. 847 no. 1).</p>

<p>The mouth of the boy has disappeared in a dint. One might think that the apparent bald patch on the forehead was due to the same accident, but it is not. At first I thought of incipient baldness and a comic touch in the artist's manner (<title>VA.</title> p. 115); later, I conjectured that the boy had recently cut off his forehead-hair and dedicated it to Apollo, as boys did when they became ephebes (<title>Panm.</title> p. 14: Hesychius s.v. <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)nisth/ria</foreign>, see also Hauser in FR. ii p. 292 and Jacobsthal <title>Die melischen Reliefs</title> p. 84). A third <pb xml:id="ii.54" n="54"/> explanation now occurs to me and should perhaps be preferred: the boy is a wrestler or pancratiast and has cut off his forehead-hair so as not to be caught hold of by it. In black-figure pictures of wrestlers the hair on the forehead often seems to be cropped.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The picture on the reverse is not connected with the other, except that both strike a festal note. A boy, wreathed, has tied his cloak round his waist, and is dragging the hide of an ox by the tail. Part of the boy's knee, in three-quarter view, is seen to left of the hide. The ox has been flayed after a sacrifice. The hide was often the perquisite of the priest. Three archaic vases have a similar subject, though not the same: a youth carries the leg of an ox over his shoulder: so on a cup by Oltos, about 520 B.C., in Providence (<title>JHS.</title> 47 p. 64; <title>CV.</title> pl. 13: <title>ARV.</title> p. 37 no. 35) and on a black-figured cup, of type C, by the Theseus Painter, in Salerno, from Fratte, about the beginning of the fifth century; a cup by the Epeleios Painter in Florence and Heidelberg, late sixth century, gives a full context (<title>ARV.</title> p. 107, below, no. 2): an old priest pours a libation on the altar; two youths carry baskets; two others, legs of an ox; then come the block and the carcass, and a youth with a chopper: more particulars will be found in <title>CF.</title> p. 11. Other vases show the flaying, or at least the preparation of the carcass, though the animal is a ram not an ox: see <title>V. Pol.</title> p. 36.</p>

<p>The figures on A are contoured with relief-lines, but not the figure on B. On A, both right elbows are damaged. The fingers of the man's left hand have partly disappeared, and so has the inner marking below his chest; on B, the fingers, the pit of the stomach, and some other parts have suffered. The hide is streaked with brown. The wreaths and sprigs are in red. At each handle, a palmette, contoured with relief. An unusual feature is the second band of maeander running round the vase not far from the base.</p>

<p>Said to have been found together with the lekythos no. 99, which it resembles in shape (see <ref target="ii.55" n="U">ii p. 55</ref>).

<p>This is a splendid example of those austerely decorated lekythoi without palmettes on the shoulder or pattern-band at the top of the body (see <ref target="ii.41" n="U">ii p. 41</ref>). A young hunter moves to left, left leg frontal, and looks round, holding a javelin in his right hand, with two fingers in the loop, ready for the cast, and in his left hand another javelin, and also the lagobolon, a short club used both for throwing at the game and for dispatching it. His hound is beside him, and stops, turns round, with head, tail and one foreleg raised, ears pricked up, aware of something. The youth wears a chitoniskos, a chlamys, shoes, stockings to mid-calf, and a petasos, one of those fine large hats which the painter liked to draw (<title>JHS.</title> 32 p. 368). The sword in its scabbard hangs in front of the body. The javelin is continued on to the shoulder of the vase. Face, nape, petasos are contoured with relief-lines, but little of the rest. The eye is dot-and-circle. Brown for whisker, the lines of the great sinew on the neck, the stripe on the chitoniskos near the lower edge. The lagobolon is covered with a brown wash. A fracture passes through the right hand and armpit, another through the middle of the spear; small parts of the chiton and the chlamys are missing below the left hand.</p>

<p>Is it just a hunter, or is it a particular hunter? The question is raised by the fragment of a skyphos, also by the Pan Painter, in Athens, found on the Acropolis (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 469a" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 469a</rs>: Langlotz pl. 38; <title>Panm.</title> pl. 24, 2: detail, <title>Jh.</title> 31 p. 16 fig. 10: <title>ARV.</title> p. 367 no. 80), which gives the upper part of an almost exact replica. There, however, a hand grasps the youth's shoulder, and another is laid on his left arm: this is Kephalos, pursued by Eos. It is quite likely that the painter thought of the figure on the Boston lekythos as Kephalos too; and the attitude of the hound suggests that someone or something is approaching from the right.</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.55" n="55"/>

<p>The black glaze of the background has covered the nipple-like projection on the crown of the petasos: it was of the same form as in the Athens skyphos, though not quite so big.</p>

<p>Height 0.314. <title>JHS.</title> 32 pp. 361-2; <title>Panm.</title> pl. 6, 3. Eros with a fawn. About 470-460 B.C., by the Pan Painter (<title>JHS.</title> 32 p. 362 no. 35; <title>VA.</title> p. 115; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 104 no. 47; <title>Panm.</title> p. 24 no. 56; <title>ARV.</title> p. 366 no. 67). Graffito.</p>

<p>The foot seems to belong to the vase. The base-fillet is large. A repainted fracture runs through the eye, left shoulder, arm of Eros (and the right hind-hoof of the fawn); another through his right shoulder and fingers; his ear is also damaged. The mark below the left armpit does not represent the nipple.</p>

<p>Eros has caught sight of a fawn, flown after it, and now he lifts it in his arms as he sinks to the ground. His right hand is on the fawn's hindquarters, his left holds it under the belly. It is more often a hare that Eros pursues, as for example on a contemporary vase, a Nolan amphora by the Charmides Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 293" type="Vase">London E 293</rs>: Raoul-Rochette pl. 44, 2, whence <title>El.</title> 4 pll. 45-6; <title>CV.</title> pl. 49, 2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 440 no. 3).</p>

<p>This is a slight work of the painter. There is hardly any relief-contour: only for the belly of Eros, the spring of the buttocks, the left shin, the back of the right shank, the forehead and cheek of the fawn. A brown line marks the sinew of the neck. There are brown inner markings on the body of Eros between breast and hip, but they are faint. Brown pubes, brown dots on the wings, brown dots and stripes on the fawn. The wreath, and the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*E</foreign>, between the face and the fawn, are in red. If the fawn had been female, one might have taken the <emph>kale</emph> to refer to it: but it is male.</p>

<p>The lekythos is again decorated on the 'Nolan' principle, without palmettes on the shoulder, or pattern-band at the upper edge of the body. The wings, as often, overlap on to the shoulder of the vase: see <ref target="ii.41" n="U">ii p. 41</ref>.</p>

<p>Height 0.3925. The shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 214 no. 168. Reveller. About 470-460 B.C., by a painter of the Mannerist Group (<title>ARV.</title> p. 399 no. 84).</p>

<p>Once again a lekythos decorated on the Nolan principle, with neither pattern above the figure, nor palmettes on the shoulder. A man with a long beard moves forward, leaning back, touching the strings of his lyre with the fingers of his left hand, and holding up the plectrum in his right. The lips are closed: he is not singing, but thinking of singing, and toying with the strings. Lyre-players are often shown leaning back: for example on a neck-amphora by the Berlin Painter in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 267" type="Vase">London E 267</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 9, 1 and pl. 10, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 133 no. 28). The lyre is of the graceful type with long arms and the greatest breadth near the cross-bar. The left forearm passes through a supporting-band attached to the lower 'horn' of the lyre. A long spotted fillet hangs from the same 'horn'. The tortoise-shell sounding-board is partly visible behind the forearm. The man wears a long chiton with kolpos and full 'false sleeves'; a himation laid shawl-wise over both shoulders; a woman's saccos, spotted, and shoes. The plectrum-string is red. Brown lines on the kolpos; brown for the markings of the tortoise-shell; the wrist-band is also brown. The face and the greater part of the rest are contoured with relief-lines. The incised sketch shows that the head was originally intended to be farther to the left. To right of the pattern below the figure there is a 'ghost' — a piece of maeander — where the vase, before it was hard, touched another. Graffito <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E</foreign>.</p>

<p>This is the only lekythos that can be assigned to the Mannerist Group. Caskey notes (<title>G.</title> pp. 215-16) that it is said to have been found together with the hunter lekythos by the Pan Painter (no. 97), which resembles it closely in shape and has the same overall proportion.</p>

<p>The picture is one of a large number in which bearded revellers wear saccos and full-length chiton as well as himation, and often carry a parasol; the reveller often has a lyre, or, if a party is depicted, a lyre-player is of it. Many of these pictures were put together <pb xml:id="ii.56" n="56"/> by Buschor (<title>Jb.</title> 38-9 pp. 128-32) and interpreted as representing a 'feast of parasols'. He conjectured that the Skirophoria were such a feast, and that a feature of it was interchange of costume, women dressing up as men and men as women; he found something unnatural in the beards on the vases, and suspected that the men were sometimes women in disguise, and the women men. Braun had already suggested that two of the pictures might represent the 'Skiadephoria' (<title>Bull.</title> 1843, p. 90); Lenormant and de Witte that two of them showed men travestied as women, and two other women travestied as men (<title>El. cér.</title> 4 p. 238). I have always described all these figures as komasts, and recently Nilsson has argued for the same view (<title>Acta. Arch.</title> 13 pp. 223-6). He points out that in several of the pictures drinking-cups are held or flourished, and krotala are held; and that such objects would be out of place in a sacred procession. As for the 'disguises', he quotes, after Deubner, the words of <bibl>Philostratus (1, 2)</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">sugxwrei= de\ o( kw=mos kai\ gunaiki\ a)ndri/zesqai kai\ a)ndri\ &lt;&lt;qh=lun e)ndu=nai stolh\n kai\ qh=lu bai/nein&gt;&gt;</foreign>.</p>

<p>Nilsson publishes a column-krater in Cleveland (below, <ref target="ii.59" n="U">ii p. 59</ref>, no. 21), on which all three figures are bearded, wear long chiton, himation, saccos; one of them holds a lyre, the second a parasol and crotala, the third a cup. Nilsson does not mention a particular which is hardly visible in his reproductions: two of the three, the lyre-player and the parasol-carrier, wear earrings. Now earrings were not worn by Greek men: they were a mark of the barbarian.<note anchored="true" n="ii.56.1"><p>There is said to have been a statue of Achilles, with pierced ears, at Sigeum: this would allude to his sojourn in Skyros: see D. S. Robertson in <title>Cambridge University Reporter</title> 5 July 1932.</p></note> It will be remembered how in the <title>Anabasis</title> (iii, I, 31) the agitator Apollonides who spoke with a Boeotian accent was disposed of: Agasias of Stymphalos said that Apollonides had nothing to do with Boeotia or even Greece: he had seen his ears and they were pierced like a Lydian's; that was the end of Apollonides. Anacreon says of his enemy Artemon that before he became rich he used to wear wooden astragaloi in his ears (fr. 54): he doubtless implies that Artemon was a barbarian or not distinguishable from one. As there is no reason to suppose that the persons on the Cleveland vase are barbarians, they must either be women disguised as men or men disguised as women: but one cannot immediately say which. I see no ground for thinking that the figures on the Cleveland vase or other figures like them are women disguised as men. There is never a female breast or other female feature; and the beards are perfectly normal. The reveller on a cup in the Louvre has been thought female because there is a beard but no moustache (<title>El. cér.</title> 4 pl. 93: below, <ref target="ii.59" n="U">ii p. 59</ref>, no. 12): but the absence of a moustache would prove nothing; and in fact there is a moustache, although it is omitted in the reproduction.</p>

<p>We take the figures, therefore, to be men. Are they disguised as women? Three elements in the costume might be considered feminine: the long chiton, the saccos, the parasol. Of these, long chiton and himation had been the regular full dress for men in earlier days: but by the time most of our vases were painted it was obsolescent or at least old-fashioned; the long chiton might still be worn on high occasions, but in ordinary circumstances may have counted as a feminine garment.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The saccos is properly a woman's article: it might indeed be worn, by youths as well as men, at komos and symposion, either with nothing else or with himation or wrap:<note anchored="true" n="ii.56.2"><p>E.g. bf. oinochoe by Kleisophos in Athens (Pfuhl fig. 254); fragment of a bf. stamnos in Oxford, <rs key="Oxford 1919.46" type="Vase">Oxford 1919.46</rs>, Perizoma Group; <rs key="Berlin inv. 3211" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 3211</rs>, stamnos of the Perizoma Group; Hegesiboulos cup in New York (<rs key="New York 07.286.47" type="Vase">New York 07.286.47</rs>; FR. pl. 93, 2; Richter and Hall pl. 10); rf. cup in Vienna (<title>Anz.</title> 7 p. 172); Braun Leagros cup (<title>ARV.</title> p. 931 no. 41). There are plenty of revellers wearing saccoi on late Chiot vases.
</p>
<p>An alternative headgear was the Oriental kidaris or tiara, also worn by men or youths at symposia and in the komos: see Jacobsthal <title>Gött. V.</title> pp. 61-2; <title>JHS.</title> 49 pp. 3-4; Dietrich von Bothmer in <title>Bull. of the American Schools of Oriental Research</title> no. 83 p. 29 and in <title>Tell en-Nasbeh</title> i p. 176.</p></note> in these cases there can be no question of the wearer being disguised as a woman, but the saccos was no doubt thought of as borrowed from feminine costume.</p>

<p>That some at least considered it effeminate in a man to use a parasol is a fair inference from the words of Anacreon (fr. 54, 11 Diehl) and perhaps of Pherecrates (fr. 54).</p>

<p>While none of the three articles singly may amount to a real disguise, the joint use of them must surely do so. Finally, two of the men wear earrings. </p>
<pb xml:id="ii.57" n="57"/>
<p>We therefore believe all these figures to be men disguised as women;<note anchored="true" n="ii.57.1"><p>Quite certain examples of men holding parasols who are disguised as women are to be found on a black-figured eye-cup in Naples, <rs key="Naples 2729" type="Vase">Naples 2729</rs>. Inside, a gorgoneion; outside, on each half, a figure between eyes. To quote Heydemann's description: 'A, a bearded man moves cautiously forward, wrapped in his mantle and holding an open parasol in his left hand; on his head he has a small female head; B, a bearded man comes to meet him, wrapped in his mantle and holding a parasol downwards in his left hand; on his head he has a female head, the neck of which ends in the body of a bird.'
</p>
<p>The small female head must be a token disguise (not exactly a mask) of the same kind as in the black-figured mastoid in the Museo Artistico Industriale at Rome (<title>RM.</title> 38-9 p. 82: see p. 84).
</p>
<p>The Naples cup is mentioned by Bloesch (<title>F.A.S.</title> p. 7), but he takes the figures to be women disguised as men, not, with us, men disguised as women. Since the above was written it has been published in <title>CV.</title> pl. 27.</p></note> but to be taking part in a komos and not in a sacred rite. An unpublished vase raises the question whether they are just komasts, or may not be particular persons:</p>

</list>
<p>There were four revellers on B, all moving quickly to right. (1) Of the left-hand figure, the hindmost, all that remains is one foot. Of the other figures, parts of the shanks and feet are preserved, with head and shoulder of the leader. (2) wears a long chiton, and shoes (persikai); to right of his knee, the bottom of a basket is seen; (3) wears a long chiton and sandals; his name ended in ...<foreign xml:lang="greek">*S</foreign>; (4) wears a himation, probably shawl-wise, as well as the long chiton (the others may have had himatia too, but that part is not preserved); he has a saccos on his head, and an ivy-wreath round his neck; he dances, kicking up one foot behind, throws his head back, and sings: the letters <foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*I*O*O</foreign> (= ee-ee o — o or the like) issue from his open mouth; over his shoulder he carries a parasol; he has a long yellow beard.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A floating fragment belongs to either (1) or (2), probably (2). It gives the hands, and part of the breast, of a male figure moving to right, wearing himation as well as chiton, an ivy-wreath round the neck, a plectrum in the right hand and a lyre, of the long type, in the left. There is an inscription in red on the arm of the lyre, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*N*A*K*R*E[*O*N]</foreign>. The letter <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A</foreign>... in the field to the right of the breast is the beginning of a word, whether <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A[*N*A*K*R*E*O*N]</foreign> again, or not. The subject of the picture is therefore 'Anacreon and his boon companions'.</p>

<p>If this floating fragment belongs to (2), as is most likely, the light basket must have hung by a cord from the lower arm of the lyre, as often: for example, on the hydria <rs key="Munich 2424" type="Vase">Munich 2424</rs>, in the earliest manner of the Kleophrades Painter (Buschor <title>Gr. Vasen</title> p. 146 fig. 165: <title>ARV.</title> p. 129 no. 4); on a cup by Makron in Athens, <rs key="Athens, Acr. 311" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 311</rs> (<title>Jb.</title> 2 p. 164; Langlotz pl. 19: <title>ARV.</title> p. 313 no. 222); on a cup by Makron in Adria (<rs key="Adria B 318" type="Vase">Adria B 318</rs>: Micali <title>Mon. ined.</title> pl. 45, 2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 308 no. 113).<note anchored="true"><p>P. 57: the Curtius fragments are now <rs key="Copenhagen 13365" type="Vase">Copenhagen 13365</rs> (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 185 no. 32).</p></note></p>

<p>The Curtius krater is among the earliest of our vases (for it must have been painted some years before the end of the sixth century); and far the finest: but in subject it is a regular member of the series. The inscription shows that it represents Anacreon and his boon companions. Does it follow that all the vases in our series have the same subject as the krater? I am inclined to think that it does: that (1) they too represent not merely a komos, but a special komos; (2) that when one of the figures is a man playing the lyre, it is Anacreon; (3) that when a figure just like these 'Anacreons' is represented alone, as on the Boston lekythos, it is Anacreon; (4) that when there is no 'Anacreon', the figures are still to be thought of as 'boon companions of Anacreon'. It might be thought safer to suppose that some of the pictures were intended to represent not Anacreon himself and his cronies, but, more generally, revellers of the good old days. The question is not easy.</p>

<p>There would perhaps be some irony in Anacreon, who seems to have objected to earrings and parasols, being represented in the company of men with parasols, or even holding a parasol himself, and wearing earrings (it will hardly be maintained that what the poet disliked was not parasols and earrings in themselves, but parasols of a certain material and earrings of a certain shape). </p>

<p>In the list that follows, Buschor's numbers are given in brackets. It includes additions. In general, the pictures are not fully described unless they are unpublished. 'Anacreon' is present in thirteen pictures out of twenty-five.<note anchored="true" n="ii.58.1"><p>Omitted from the count, the Cippico stamnos (no. 7), about which I am ill-informed, and the Adria fragment (no. 16), where little can be said about the composition. Buschor's list includes as no. 15, a late bf. fragment in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 682" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 682</rs>: Graef pl. 46), but the figure there is female.</p></note> Five of these are single-figure pieces, with 'Anacreon' alone. Naturally enough the lyre-player seldom carries a parasol; but on the Madrid stamnos he has one under his arm. Of the pictures in which there is no 'Anacreon', four have a single figure only, a reveller who may be thought of from one point of view, as an extract from a larger composition. Women are present seven times: once, on the pelike in Rhodes (no. 20) together with 'Anacreon'; six times in place of him, providing the music, with flute, cithara, or lyre. Most of the vases were painted between 490 and 450; but the black-figured plate, and the Curtius krater, are earlier.</p>

A woman stands to right, playing the flute: in front of her, a man dances to right, looking round and down; he wears a chiton reaching to mid-calf, a wrap over both shoulders, a saccos, an ivy-wreath, boots, holds a lyre in the right hand, and raises his left arm above his head with a cup in the hand. Behind the woman, a camp-stool; hanging on the wall, a flute-case with mouthpiece-box. The date is probably about 520-510. By our rule I suppose we should call the man Anacreon, since he holds a lyre: but his attitude is so unlike that of the other lyre-players that there would be a case for excepting him.</item>

<p>A kind of forerunner of these figures perhaps appears on an earlier vase, a black-figured amphora of peculiar shape in Rhodes (see <ref target="ii.9" n="U">ii p. 9</ref>), which is in the manner of Lydos, belongs to the third quarter of the sixth century, and cannot be very much later than the middle. It shows a komos of three persons: a naked youth with a cithara: another, with a drinking-horn, who seems to be dancing; and a man with a short beard also holding a drinking-horn. He wears a long, sleeveless chiton, the skirt of which he lifts with one hand; loose boots with tops turned over; and something on his head. Unfortunately the vase is damaged or daubed over at this point, and one cannot be quite sure whether the headgear is a saccos, as seems more probable, or a 'mitra'. Even if it is a saccos, the figure does not quite enter into our series, and is best described as a forerunner.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>One or two of our lyre-players have already been interpreted as Anacreon. Helbig gave the name of Anacreon to the man with lyre and parasol on the vase in Berlin (<title>Bull.</title> 1879 pp. 3-4; above, no. 14), and Mrs. Karouzou to the lyre-player on the amphora in the Louvre (<title>BCH.</title> 1942-3 pp. 248-54: above, no. 4). She was led to make the identification by a similarity between the Louvre figure and the inscribed portrait of Anacreon on the lekythos signed by the potter Gales in Syracuse (see below, <ref target="ii.61" n="U">ii p. 61</ref>). There is neither saccos in the Gales picture, nor parasol: nor is there in the figure on the front of the Louvre amphora: but the figure on the back, which is clearly connected with the other, is a man dancing, wearing a saccos, and holding a parasol. Mrs. Karouzou assumes that he is 'a participant in the Feast of Parasols', and if he, then the 'Anacreon' on the front of the vase. In our view the two men are not taking part in any religious ceremony, but in an ordinary revel or komos.</p>

<p>The Curtius Anacreon is one of three inscribed portraits of the poet on vases. The other two are well known. The earlier is on a red-figured cup by Oltos in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 18" type="Vase">London E 18</rs>: Jahn <title>Dichter</title> pl. 3; I, Murray no. 14; detail of B, <title>Jh.</title> 3 p. 89; B, <title>ML.</title> 19 p. 95 fig. 11; B, Schefold <title>Die Bildnisse der antiken Dichter, Denker und Redner</title> p. 51, above: <pb xml:id="ii.61" n="61"/> <title>ARV.</title> p. 40 no. 69). On B, Anacreon strides forward, holding plectrum and lyre, dressed in a himation, with a wreath on his bare head; there is nothing feminine in his costume, he is an ordinary reveller. Two persons hasten towards him, a youth called <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N*U*F*E*S</foreign> (Ny(m)phes) with a cloak over his shoulders, and a youth or man (the upper part is missing) whose name ends in -<foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*N</foreign>, dressed in a himation. In the <emph>restoration</emph> published by Schefold (<title>Bildnisse</title> p. 51, middle) this figure is made into a youth. The <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, retrograde, on the left of the picture might refer to Anacreon, but is probably unattached. The date should be about 520-510.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The third inscribed Anacreon is on a red-figured lekythos signed by the potter Gales, in Syracuse (<rs key="Syracuse 26967" type="Vase">Syracuse 26967</rs>: <title>ML.</title> 19 pl. 3 and p. 96 figs. 9-10, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> i p. 465, <title>BCH.</title> 1942-3 p. 248, Schefold <title>Bildnisse</title> p. 51, below; the back, Jacobsthal <title>O.</title> pl. 54, b): by the Gales Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 31, above, no. 2). Anacreon moves to right, with plectrum and lyre, accompanied by two youths wearing cloaks over arm or shoulders and holding sticks. The poet wears a long chiton, a himation (shawl-wise), a wreath and a fillet, perhaps shoes. The head, which is much damaged, is thought to be bald, and may be so: a long time ago I thought I made out a saccos: I lay no stress on my old note, but should like to re-examine the original. Wilamowitz (<title>Sappho und Simonides</title> p. 102) and Mrs. Karouzou think that the left-hand youth is offering the skyphos to Anacreon (<title>BCH.</title> 66-7 p. 250), but this does not seem likely: for the figure compare the cup by the Panaitios Painter in the Czartoryski collection (Hartwig pl. 11; <title>V. Pol.</title> pl. 8, 1; <title>CV.</title> pl. 8, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 213 no. 1). The other youth is probably flourishing his stick, not threatening anyone with it, as Schefold (op. cit. p. 50). The vase is later than the Oltos cup, probably about 500 B.C.: see also Haspels <title>ABL.</title> p. 69.</p>

<p>A red-figured cup of the same period as the three inscribed portraits, <rs key="Louvre G 94" type="Vase">Louvre G 94</rs>, has, inside, an athlete using a pickaxe, outside, athletes on one half, on the other a komos with an old man holding a lyre among a group of youths. The musician is not named, but it is likely enough that the painter had Anacreon in his mind.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) Pp. 55-61.

<p>This is one of a dozen skyphoi or cup-skyphoi by the Penthesilea Painter (<title>ARV.</title> pp. 587-8):<note anchored="true" n="ii.61.1"><p>Add to them the skyphos which is ascribed to the school of the Penthesilea Painter in <title>ARV.</title> p. 627 no. 46, but which I now see to be by the painter himself: <rs key="Oxford 1943.79" type="Vase">Oxford 1943.79</rs>: A, Herakles and Geras; B, youth leaving home (<title>Bull. van de Vereniging</title> 24-6 pp. 18-19).</p></note> cup-painters, when they are not decorating cups, tend, as is natural enough, to take up other kinds of drinking-vessel, rather than pots. This is a normal skyphos of type A. As to the proportions, Hambidge and Caskey have pointed out that the diameter of the bowl is 1.236 of the height, and that this ratio is very common in skyphoi (Hambidge <title>The Diagonal</title> p. 110; Caskey <title>G.</title> pp. 155-6 and 158). As usual in the Penthesilea Painter, only a few cross-squares interrupt the maeander. At each handle, a design of three palmettes. There is hardly any relief-contour. The ivy-wreath above the pictures is red, with reserved leaves.</p>

<p>A. In the middle is a woman, seen from the front, but with head in profile. Her lower part, from the knees downwards, is concealed; and she seems to be rising from a deep place. She lifts her skirt with both hands, and looks up at a goat-man, a Pan, who <pb xml:id="ii.62" n="62"/> stumbles towards her, fascinated and frightened. On the other side a second Pan capers and bellows with excitement.</p>

<p>The woman wears a peplos, with long overfall, overgirt with a broad band; and on her head a saccos which conceals her hair, except where it escapes, or rather is combed down, in front of the ear. This fashion of hair is frequent when the saccos is worn: one example only, the women on the Ludovisi relief and its Boston counterpart.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Helbig, who gave the first account of the vase (<title>Bull.</title> 1881 pp. 148-9), described the woman as Gaia or Persephone; Fröhner, publishing it (<title>Annali</title> 1884 pp. 205-8), pronounced her to be Persephone and the subject her return from Hades. This has been the general opinion since. On an Attic red-figured calyx-krater in Dresden, from the Group of Polygnotos (<title>Anz.</title> 1892 p. 166: A, Brommer <title>Satyroi</title> p. 64: <title>ARV.</title> p. 699 no. 67), a goddess rises, still half concealed, in the presence of Hermes and three Pans: her name is inscribed: it is <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*F*E]*R*E*F*A*T*T*A</foreign>. Not long ago, however, a small red-figured pelike of about the same period as the Boston skyphos was found at Camiros in Rhodes (<title>Cl. Rh.</title> 4 pp. 103-6 whence, A, <title>Sitz. Bay.</title> 1937=Buschor <title>Feldmäuse</title> p. 16; <title>CV.</title> pl. 1, 2-3 and pl. 2, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 720, Erichthonios Painter no. 2). Here again a woman, still half concealed, rises, in the presence of Hermes and Pan. Had there been no inscription, we should have called her Persephone: but there is an inscription, and it is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*F*R*O*D*I*T*E</foreign>. It is possible, of course, that the humble painter of the pelike made a slip and wrote the wrong name: but a fourth vase shows that Pan is fully in place at the Birth of Aphrodite. This is a fine red-figured hydria, by a member of the Polygnotan Group, in Syracuse (<rs key="Syracuse 23912" type="Vase">Syracuse 23912</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 24: <title>ARV.</title> p. 701 no. 99). Although no names are inscribed, the subject is certainly the Birth of Aphrodite, assisted by Eros, in the presence of the white-haired Moirai, Ares, and Pan. If further proof were needed that this is the subject of the Syracuse hydria, it is provided by a fragment of a bell-krater, the work of Polygnotos, in Agrigento (<title>ARV.</title> p. 678 no. 18): part of the group in the middle remains, Aphrodite and Eros in the same attitudes as before; and the last letters of the name <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*A*F*R*O*D*I]*T*E</foreign>. It is hard to decide which of the two goddesses is represented on the Boston vase. The costume is not conclusive. The saccos is worn by both. Persephone sometimes wears a peplos with long overfall, overgirt, for instance on a volute-krater by the Niobid Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 343" type="Vase">Louvre G 343</rs>: Millingen <title>AUM.</title> 1 pl. 24; <title>CV.</title> d pl. 5, 3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 419 no. 15) and on a lost vase (Tischbein 4 pl. 8). (The garment on our vase looks more homely, but that is the naturalism of the Penthesilea Painter.) Aphrodite wears the same garment on the amphoriskos by the Heimarmene Painter in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin inv. 30036" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 30036</rs>; FR. pl. 170, 2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 738, foot, no. 1). If the Penthesilea Painter could clothe Gaia in this fashion, as he does on his Tityos cup in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2688" type="Vase">Munich 2688</rs>; FR. pl. 55; I, Pfuhl fig. 502: Diepolder <title>Penth.</title> pl. 16: <title>ARV.</title> p. 583 no. 2), he might clothe Aphrodite in the same way. In favour, perhaps, of Aphrodite, that the picture is rather nearer to the pelike in Rhodes than to any other vase; and that such pictures as we have of the Return of Persephone are more solemn in tone. The lifting of the skirt might be held to speak for Aphrodite: in the Ludovisi relief, although she does not lift her skirt, it is lifted for her by the Horai: but no one would press such an argument. The motive recurs on the Penthesilea Painter's skyphos in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 840" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 840</rs>: Luynes pll. 30-1; phot. Giraudon 8097, whence Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 24: <title>ARV.</title> p. 587 no. 101), where Iris lifts her skirt with both hands to run. The sprig of ivy, hanging or falling, might be used to argue that the figure is neither Aphrodite nor Persephone, but a maenad: but, although it occurs in Dionysiac scenes (<ref target="ii.65" n="U">ii p. 65</ref>), it also occurs in an 'Eos and Tithonos' on a cup by our artist in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 451" type="Vase">Louvre G 451</rs>: Pottier pl. 146: <title>ARV.</title> p. 584 no. 26), so that it need not have any special significance. 'The same is true of the ivy-wreath running round the top of the vase. The two great cups by the Penthesilea Painter in Munich are both bordered with ivy, although there is nothing Dionysiac in the subjects (<rs key="Munich 2688" type="Vase">Munich 2688</rs> and <rs key="Munich 2689" type="Vase">Munich 2689</rs>; <title>ARV.</title> pp. 582-3 nos. 1-2: FR. pl. 6 and FR. pl. 55).</p>

<p>Robert's interpretation of the figure as the nymph of a spring (<title>Arch. Märchen</title> pp. 194-5) was contested by Furtwängler (<title>Jb.</title> 6 pp. 112-24) and was later withdrawn by Robert himself (<title>Hermes</title> 29 p. 176). Buschor, after the discovery of the pelike from Camiros, thought that she might be Aphrodite (<title>Feldmäuse</title> p. 17). It has been suggested that the <pb xml:id="ii.63" n="63"/> subject is derived from a satyr-play: but it is difficult to believe that the satyrs of the satyr-play chorus were ever replaced by Pans.<note anchored="true" n="ii.63.1"><p>A good picture of the Birth of Aphrodite is on a fourth-century Faliscan calyx-krater, from Fabrica di Roma, in the Villa Giulia, <rs key="Villa Giulia 8236" type="Vase">Villa Giulia 8236</rs>. A naked woman, half-shown, rises in the middle, her face in three-quarter view, her arms raised, the flesh white, in presence of four satyrs who run and caper. The naked goddess is called Kore by Della Seta (<title>Museo di Villa Giulia</title> p. 103), but must be Aphrodite.</p></note></p>

<p>Pans are sometimes goat-footed or goat-shanked; here they have nothing goat-like but the tail, and the head, which, as in the bell-krater by the Pan Painter (<ref target="ii.48" n="U">ii p. 48</ref>), is pure goat, not, as often, human apart from ears and horns. One Pan is hairier than the other. On early representations of Pan see <ref target="ii.48" n="U">ii p. 48</ref>.</p>

<p>B. On the reverse of the vase, a maenad and two satyrs. The maenad runs, the satyrs dance along, dancing being more natural to them than walking or running. One satyr leads, thyrsus in hand, looking back; the other would like to lay hands on the maenad, but she turns and gives him a hard look: he shrinks and his tail droops. This is a favourite situation in the Penthesilea Painter and other artists: the nymphs or maenads are vigorous viragos, well able to protect themselves if they wish.</p>

<p>The maenad holds a kantharos in her right hand, and in her left a thyrsus, not gripped as usual, but laid lightly on her shoulder and palm. She wears a saccos and a peplos, which has an overfall, and also a long kolpos, over which it is girt with a broad band.</p>

I, youth and boy. A-B, athletes. About 460 B.C., by the Penthesilea Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 584 no. 22).</p>

<p>The cup is one of the oldest finds in the Museum collection of vases, for it was published by Mazzocchi in 1754-8. Inghirami, in 1824, speaks of it as in the Museo degli studi at Naples. Then it disappears, and does not come to light again till 1928.</p>

<p>Inside, a boy sits on a rough-hewn stone seat, wrapped in his himation, his feet dangling, while a youth leans on his stick talking to him. The youth's himation leaves both arms free, and he uses them to gesticulate. His face has a serious look; the boy smiles. As usual in this painter and his school, there are very few cross-squares in the maeander — only three. The 'odd man' of the maeander (see <ref target="ii.24" n="U">ii p. 24</ref>) is south.</p>

<p>Outside, the scene is laid in the palaestra. In the middle of A, a young athlete holds <pb xml:id="ii.64" n="64"/> a pair of acontia in his left hand and a sling-like bag, containing a discus, in his right. He has picked up the acontia and taken the bag down from the wall, and is eager to begin. A pair of halt&emacr;res hangs beside him. He walks up to the trainer, a youth dressed in a himation and holding a forked wand. Near them is a fluted pillar, such as marked the starting-place. On the right, a second athlete walks away, looking back, with a pick in his hand for loosening the ground.</p>

<p>On the other half of the exterior the pillar is seen on the left of the picture, and beside it an athlete stoops, his left leg bent more than his right, his left hand resting on the left knee, his right arm extended with the hand open, palm inward. A young trainer moves quickly forward, looking round at him, holding out his forked wand. A second athlete comes up on the right, holding a pair of halt&emacr;res in his left hand, not using them, but watching the other, and following the movement with interest if not with a word of advice. A pair of boxer's thongs hangs on the wall, and a discus in its bag.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The single palmette, upright, circumscribed, is the Penthesilea Painter's most usual handle-ornament.</p>

<p>I do not remember any other figure like the athlete on the left of B. Norman Gardiner describes it as 'the best representation we have of a starter. A youthful runner stands ready to start beside a pillar which marks the starting-line, and opposite him stands a young trainer with his forked wand ready to correct him if he starts too soon' (<title>G.A.S.</title> pp. 275-6). The trainer, however, is not standing but hastening forward, perhaps thought of as at an angle of 45 degrees to the runner. It is practice, of course, not the race itself.</p>

<p>On other figures of athletes at the start see <title>BSA.</title> 46 pp. 9-13.</p>

<p>Most of the youths wear a thin head-fillet with a short turned-up tag in front. The youth with the discus on A has a string tied round his left wrist: such bracelets are common (Wolters <title>Faden und Knoten als Amulett</title> in <title>ARW.</title> 8, supplement). The post on A is capped by a sort of Doric cyma; this part is damaged in B. The disci are marked with a swastika, as often. The discus-bags are of the regular type; the bag on A is edged with egg-pattern. The pick has a single prong: such picks were used in the palaestra as well as the two-pronged ones, but are less common: see <title>EVP.</title> pp. 59, 60, and 80: both sorts occur on the psykter by Euthymides in Turin (<ref target="ii.7" n="U">ii p. 7</ref>, B. 7).</p>

<p>The inscriptions, each in two lines, are twice <foreign xml:lang="greek">jopais kalos</foreign> and thrice <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos jopais</foreign>, but the familiar words are — wilfully one would say — garbled: this is common in the school of the Penthesilea Painter, and in his own work recurs on a cup in the Cabinet des Médailles (<rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 820" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 820</rs>: see <ref target="ii.67" n="U">ii p. 67</ref>). On the Boston cup one reads, roughly: on I, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*D*L*S *K*D*L*O*S</foreign>, on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*D*P*O*S *H*O*P*D*L*N</foreign> twice, on B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*D*L*O*S *H*O*P*D*L*L</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*D*L*O*S *H*O*P*D*L*N</foreign>.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The surface of the cup is damaged in places: the faces of both athletes on B have suffered; so have the hand of one trainer and the arm of the other, and the left-hand halt&emacr;r on A. There is hardly any relief-contour. The brown inner markings on the bodies do not all come out in the photographs. Brown lines are used for minor folds in the himation of the boy inside and the trainer on A. The painter forgot to fill in the background above the discus on A, and between one of the palmette-tendrils and the handle. The cup is an example of the painter's everyday work, not careful, but lively and free.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B. Bloesch observes that most of the Penthesilea Painter's cups belong to what he calls the 'Three-corner Group' from the form of the edge of the foot-plate, and were shaped by one potter (<title>F.A.S.</title> pp. 103-7). The foot of our finely fashioned cup is not 'three-cornered', but a thin torus, as in no. 102. The bowl is shallow, the stem thin; the jog on the upper side of the foot is a good way from the edge. Underneath the foot, a black band, not thick, and a black line.</p>

<p>Inside, a youth and a woman. She sits at home, holding a fruit (apple?) in each hand, while the youth talks to her, leaning slightly on his stick. On the left, a wool-basket, and a distaff, wound with wool, standing in it; a sash hangs on the wall. The youth wears a himation, the woman a chiton, a himation veiling her head, and a saccos. She sits on a plain stool with rectangular legs (Richter <title>Furniture</title> p. 37 and fig. 103). It has a striped cover. The border is the painter's usual variety of maeander, with three cross-squares. The 'odd man' (<ref target="ii.24" n="U">ii p. 24</ref>) is south-east.</p>

<p>Outside, satyrs and maenads, two pairs on each half. These groups illustrate what was said above about the relations between maenad and satyr in the Penthesilea Painter.</p>

<p>In the right-hand group on A the satyr holds a drinking-horn and threatens the maenad with his thyrsus; in the left-hand group, the maenad holds thyrsus and wineskin, and the satyr approaches her ingratiatingly. On the left of B, it is the maenad who attacks the satyr with her thyrsus, and he flees before her. As she attacks she guards herself by extending her left arm under cover of her cloak, a well-known attitude. The satyr holds a wineskin. On the right of B, the satyr's approach is again insinuating; the maenad makes off. She holds a torch as well as a thyrsus. On the left of B is a sprig of ivy, leaves and inflorescence, hanging or rather falling. This occurs in other vases by the Penthesilea Painter (see <ref target="ii.62" n="U">ii p. 62</ref>) and his contemporaries: cup by the Pistoxenos Painter in the Louvre, <rs key="Louvre CA 2952" type="Vase">Louvre CA 2952</rs> (<ref target="ii.97" n="U">ii p. 97</ref>); cup in London, <rs key="London 95.1-5.3" type="Vase">London 95.1-5.3</rs> (<title>ARV.</title> p. 573); cup in Oxford, <rs key="Oxford 1943.52" type="Vase">Oxford 1943.52</rs> (<title>Ashm. Report</title> 1943 pl. 1).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The maenads are all dressed differently. The left-hand maenad on A wears a chiton, a short 'Ionic' himation fastened on the left shoulder, and her hair in a sling; the other, chiton and himation; the left-hand maenad on B, a chiton with a long kolpos, a cloak worn chlamys-fashion, and a saccos; the other a chiton with long kolpos, the skin of a feline, and her hair in a sling. Three of the thyrsus-heads are 'red-figure'; in the other two, where the thyrsus-head appears against a light background, the leaves are in black.</p>

<p>At each handle, a palmette of the same general type as in the athlete cup by the same painter (<ref target="ii.64" n="U">ii p. 64</ref>), but the tendrils are larger, start lower down, and are continued by a stalk which ends in a large leaf, point downwards.</p>

<p>The cup is of type B. The bowl is less shallow than in the athlete cup (no. 101), the stem a little shorter; the edge of the foot-plate is again a thin torus.</p>

<p>This is one of the painter's slightest works. There is hardly any relief-contour. Relief-lines, however, for the tendrils on which the palmettes are based. Brown lines for inner markings on the satyrs' bodies. No red.</p>

<p>The cup that most resembles ours is <rs key="Oxford 1920.57" type="Vase">Oxford 1920.57</rs> (<title>CV.</title> pl. 3, 4 and pl. 9, 3-4). There also, sprigs of ivy in the field; and a maenad attacking, with her arm in a chlamys-like cloak.</p>

<p>Inside, a single figure: a woman standing frontal, the left leg slightly bent at the knee, the head turned to left. She wears a chiton, a himation fastened in 'Ionic' fashion on the right shoulder; her hair is in a sling, a spotted kerchief; she holds a sceptre in her right hand, and a large oinochoe in her left. The sceptre shows her of consequence, perhaps a goddess. The oinochoe might have helped to identify her, but I cannot tell who she is; nor do I know any other oinochoe of just this shape.</p>

<p>The floral head of the sceptre does not connect properly with the shaft, a piece of casualness that would have offended those of the painter's contemporaries who valued the precise tradition of the archaic period.</p>

<p>Outside, on each half, two youths accosting a woman. On A, the woman, seen frontal, moving forward, turns her head towards a youth who holds out a joint of meat towards her. We used to think this rather a prosaic gift. The other youth raises his right hand with thumb and index together, talking. Small parts of the fingers are repainted: the modern is omitted in our drawing. Parts of eye and ear are repainted too. The woman wears a chiton with a kolpos and over the breast a flounce; a himation is draped over both shoulders and the back of the hair, which is confined by a narrow stephane. The youths wear himatia and have sticks. B, unlike A, is in perfect preservation, and the picture is more attractive. The woman, again seen frontal, with the left knee slightly bent, turns her head and looks at a youth who is evidently shy. His attitude, with head bent and one hand raised to his cheek, is one of a family of attitudes that first appear in the early classic period and denote various states of mind — thought, concern, suspense, distress, regret, shame. The youth's stick drags behind him, held loosely in his left hand. His companion looks at the lady with less emotion, and there is assurance in the free way he holds his stick: of course she is not looking at him. The woman wears a chiton, and is well wrapped up in her himation, which she holds out a little at the side with her right hand; her hair is all but concealed under a saccos, which is ornamented with a circle and dot. This is an expressive figure, and its undulations contrast with the upright lines of the woman on A. One is inclined to think of her as the mistress and the woman on B as the maid: but they are doubtless both <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(tai=rai ko/smiai</foreign>.</p>

<p>An earlier counterpart to these scenes will be found on a small black-figured neck-amphora in Würzburg (<rs key="Wrzburg 223" type="Vase">Würzburg 223</rs>: Langlotz pl. 61).</p>

<p>At each handle, a design of six palmettes. There is no relief-contour in the figure-work, but the egg-pattern above the pictures is bounded by relief-lines. Brown inner markings. No white or red. The drawing is finer than in the two other cups by the same painter (nos. 101 and 102).</p>

<p>Very deep bowl, offset lip, heavy handles. The foot is modern, restored after that of <rs key="Berlin 2547" type="Vase">Berlin 2547</rs> (see below, no. 4). Besides the cup of type B, the Penthesilea Painter occasionally used a rarer type, a version of the 'Acrocup' (Bloesch <title>F.A.S.</title> pp. 141-4 and pll. 39-40). The Acrocup, descendant of the black-figure Droop Cup (<title>JHS.</title> 52 pp. 55-71, Ure), has an offset lip, a torus moulding at the junction of bowl and stem, a stout foot-plate, usually black at the side, and usually a stout stem and a deep bowl. Most Acrocups are black, but a few have red-figure pictures. The cup in Boston is one of four forming a group, differing in minor particulars, but closely interrelated and perhaps by one potter. Three of the four were decorated by the Penthesilea Painter, one by a follower.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of this small class is the presence of a band of pattern on the bowl above the picture: egg-pattern in the Boston cup, egg-pattern of a different form in the Paris cup; a Doric cyma (a rectangular version of the egg-pattern) on the two others. The foot varies in detail. For the foot of <rs key="Berlin 2547" type="Vase">Berlin 2547</rs> see Bloesch pl. 39, 3. In <rs key="Berlin 2548" type="Vase">Berlin 2548</rs> the side of the foot-plate is a plain torus, reserved; below the fillet there is a reserved band at the top of the stem, survival of a feature of the Droop Cup; so also in the Paris cup, but there the side of the foot-plate is black and slightly lipped, with a reserved line at the top. The foot of the Boston cup is modern; but the base of the bowl is ancient, and preserves a traditional feature: the reserved band is descended from the light band, usually decorated with rays, which is regular in this part of the Droop Cup. Many Acrocups retain a vestige of this feature — the upper part of the fillet and the adjacent part of the bowl are reserved: but it is seldom so pronounced as here.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A small fragment in Adria, <rs key="Adria B 474" type="Vase">Adria B 474</rs>, comes from a fifth cup of our type, but all that remains is a piece of the offset lip with a little of the bowl: at the top of the bowl, egg-pattern; below the pattern, the top of a left-hand upper lateral palmette, circumscribed, with the mid-petal projecting. A still smaller fragment, with egg-pattern, in the Louvre is from a sixth such cup. A third fragment, which looks from the publication as if it were from a similar cup, is in Odessa (<title>Zap. Od.</title> 16, pl. 2, 1). What is preserved of the pictures is part of the right-hand figure on one half of the exterior, a naked boy; to left of him, sponge and aryballos suspended; to right of him, part of a handle-palmette; above, egg-pattern. Inscriptions give not only the end of a kalos-name, ...demos, but the end of the potter's name, ...gron or ...dron (Andron?). The painter may be a later follower of Douris (<title>ARV.</title> p. 911 no. 20), in any case the cup is contemporary with our four.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 67, ten lines from the foot.

<p>From the excavations of Riccardo Mancini. The drawings are by Caskey. Height 0.438, diameter 0.4785. Side-view, Jacobsthal <title>O.</title> pl. 61, b; the shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 124. A, Zeus pursuing Thetis; B, a Nereid running to Nereus. About 470-460 B.C., by the Fröhner Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 417 no. 2).</p>

<p>A: Zeus runs to right, both arms extended, the sceptre in his right hand. A woman flees from him, looking back, her arms at full stretch. Behind Zeus another woman also flees, looking back, her arms extended as before. B: a third woman flees to an old man, both arms stretched out towards him; he holds a sceptre. Between the two is a flaming altar, with a palm-tree behind it.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on A are meaningless, on B have meaning. On A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*O*A*L</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*O*N</foreign> with room for one letter in the break aft, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*O*N*A</foreign>, the last letter being formless. On B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign> between the woman and the tree, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N*E*R*E*U*S</foreign> between the tree and the man, who is therefore Nereus.</p>

<p>Zeus wears a thick chitoniskos with a pattern of small crosses, and broad borders — spirals above and below, slanting palmettes at the ends of the sleeves; over both arms, a fringed wrap; round the head a wreath of small leaves. The pursued woman wears a chiton of the same material as Zeus's, with a pattern of small crosses, and ess-borders above, in the middle, below, and at the sleeves; over the chiton, a himation of 'Ionic' fashion, leaving right breast and shoulder free; bracelet, earrings; a long head-band with fringed ends and a pattern of saltire-squares. Her companion wears a linen chiton, with a kolpos, and a wrap over both shoulders; necklace, earrings, a stephane or circlet with leaves in front. The woman on the reverse wears the same kind of chiton, with a himation, shawl-wise, over her shoulders; earrings and a long fringed head-band. Nereus is dressed in a long chiton and himation. His sceptre ends in a palmette. The volutes of the altar run up to a point half-way between them and are ornamented with palmettes and petal-filling; below this, tongue-pattern. At each handle, a plant-palmette.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The contours are in relief lines. The forehead-hair on A is rendered by raised dots; in the forehead-hair of the woman on B, the dots are not raised so high. The hair and beard of Nereus are reserved. The borders of Zeus' chiton are in relief. In the figure of Zeus, brown inner markings, including the collar-bones. The eyelashes of the pursued are in brown; the lids of the woman on the reverse have a brown outer edging. Red for the fillet of Nereus, the flame, and the inscriptions.</p>

<p>Since the old man to whom the maiden on the back of the vase flees is Nereus, and since the picture on the back is clearly a continuation of the picture on the front, she and her two companions must be daughters of Nereus. Zeus is pursuing a Nereid. The only Nereid whom Zeus is heard of as favouring is the eldest, Thetis. He never enjoyed her: Themis warned Zeus and Poseidon that Thetis was destined to bear a son stronger than his father; they therefore retired and gave her in marriage to a mortal, Peleus. Others said that Thetis herself, in gratitude to Hera who had reared her, resisted Zeus, who in anger gave her to a mortal. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Dio\s o(rmw=ntos e)pi\ th\n tau/ths sunousi/an</foreign>... (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.12.5">Apollod. 3.12.5</bibl>); <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Zeu\s e)rasqei\s th=s *Qe/tidos th=s *Nhre/ws e)di/wken au)th\n boulo/menos bia/sasqai</foreign> (schol. Hom. <title>Il.</title> 1, 519). That should be the subject of our picture.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>It might perhaps be held that the inscription <title>Nereus</title> was due to an error of the vase-painter's: that he substituted the sea-god Nereus for the river-god Asopos; and that the maiden pursued by Zeus is Aigina, who is named on other vases. This, however, is not the only picture of Zeus pursuing a sea-nymph: there are two others. One of them is on a Nolan amphora by the Providence Painter in Boston (<rs key="Boston 03.789" type="Vase">Boston 03.789</rs>: no. 91, <ref target="ii.44" n="U">ii p. 44</ref>): a man wearing long chiton and himation, and holding a sceptre, pursues a woman who holds a dolphin. The other is on a column-krater by the Agrigento Painter in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 1927.1" type="Vase">Oxford 1927.1</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 60, 5-6: <title>ARV.</title> p. 378 no. 3): a man with a cloak over his shoulders and a sceptre in his hand pursues a woman who holds a dolphin; a companion precedes her and an altar is seen; one of the three fleeing women on the reverse of the vase also holds a dolphin. The figure with the sceptre in these two vases can hardly be other than <pb xml:id="ii.69" n="69"/> Zeus.<note anchored="true" n="ii.69.1"><p>Another possible instance is on a column-krater, from Pulsano, in Taranto, by the Syracuse Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 352 no. 5): a bearded god pursues a woman who holds a dolphin: he holds either a sceptre or a trident, I thought a sceptre.</p></note> Poseidon is perhaps just possible. Poseidon is given a sceptre instead of a trident by Makron on the skyphos in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 140" type="Vase">London E 140</rs>; <title>Mon.</title> 9 pl. 43; Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> 2 p. 61; FR. pl. 161; <title>ARV.</title> p. 301 no. 3), but he is also given a dolphin there, so that even without the inscription there would be no doubt who he was.<note anchored="true" n="ii.69.2"><p>I do not count the 'Poseidons' on a pair of pelikai, by the Painter of the Birth of Athena, in the Villa Giulia: see <ref target="ii.90" n="U">ii p. 90</ref>.</p></note></p>

<p>Were it not for the inscription <title>Nereus</title> on the reverse of the Boston krater, two other names might have had to be considered for the woman: Dione is numbered by Hesiod among the daughters of Okeanos (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 353">Hes. Th. 353</bibl>), and he may possibly have thought of her as that spouse of Zeus to whom he doubtless refers at the beginning of the poem (<bibl n="Hes. Th. 17">Hes. Th. 17</bibl>); while, as D. S. Robertson reminded me, Nemesis, according to the <title>Cypria</title> (fr. vii Allen), transformed herself into a fish to escape the embraces of Zeus.</p>

<p>Fragments of a large volute-krater, from the Fröhner bequest, in the Cabinet des Médailles, are the only other work of this painter hitherto identified (<title>ARV.</title> p. 417, above, no. 1). The picture on the body is finer than in the Boston vase, the minor picture of Peleus and Thetis on the neck is of about the same quality (<title>Le Musée</title> 2 p. 193 fig. 7). The massive, grandiose figures bear some affinity to those of the Altamura Painter, but also to those of other contemporary artists, such as the Oreithyia Painter or the Aegisthus.</p>

<p>Apollo, dressed in chiton and himation, and wreathed with bay, stands at his altar, holding the cithara on his left arm, and a phiale in his right hand; his quiver is at his shoulder. Some spare string, and a piece of cloth, fringed, and ornamented with saltires, hang from the cithara: see <ref target="i.20" n="U">i p. 20</ref>. Behind, a column, indicating a building. The capital is of 'Aeolic' type. Artemis, wearing a chiton, with kolpos, and over it a fawnskin, stands facing him, about to fill his phiale from the oinochoe (of type I, like our vase) held in the right hand. Her left hand holds the bow; the quiver is at her back. Stephane, adorned with leaves; earrings. At the base of the handle, a double palmette.</p>

<p>The rendering of the phiale, with three horizontal lines on it, is unusual. Similar, but with two lines only, in the calyx-krater by the same painter in Lyons (<title>ARV.</title> p. 413 no. 18). In other vases of his (volute-krater in Cairo, hydria in Cambridge, pelike and oinochoe in the Hearst collection at San Simeon, <title>ARV.</title> nos. 3, 46, 42, 54) there is a row of dots between one of the pairs of lines, the dots being a summary indication of an embossed pattern — leaves or the like, which are shown in yet other vases by our artist and often elsewhere.</p>

<p>Relief-contours in the flesh and parts of the clothes.</p>

<p>The Altamura Painter decorated several oinochoai of type I. The Boston vase has a rather narrow body and a broad base, without fillet. The subject, Apollo with Artemis, or with Artemis and Leto, is a special favourite in the group of artists to which the Altamura Painter belongs: see <ref target="ii.82" n="U">ii p. 82</ref>.</p>

<p>Relief-lines are used for the contours. The hair of the left-hand figure on A is edged with a relief-line. Red for the leaves of Dionysos' branch, and the blood of the Giant's wound near his waist.</p>

<p>A. The Giant, wounded, has turned tail and falls on one knee, but rounds and strikes with his sword. Dionysos presses on him, holding out a vine-branch in his left hand and using the butt of his thyrsus with his right. Two maenads back their master up, one ready to hurl a rock on the enemy, the other to beat him with her thyrsus.</p>

<p>Dionysos wears a chitoniskos, with a flounce, and a short kolpos which is belted and drawn down over the belt at both sides; on his left arm a small fringed wrap; boots with fur flaps; ivy-wreath. The giant is fully armed, but without greaves: chitoniskos, leather corslet strengthened in front with bronze scales, helmet, shield. The shoulder-pieces are decorated with quatrefoils. The sword is of the kopis type (see <ref target="ii.21" n="U">ii p. 21</ref>), and the hilt, as often in that type, ends in the head of a bird. The left-hand maenad wears a chiton with a kolpos, and on the breast a double thickness, whether caused by girding or by a flounce; over the chiton a nebris. The ends of her long hair are gathered into a small bag; her head is encircled by a broad band of stuff, ornamented in front with the foreparts of four winged horses — a chariot-team — in the round. The other maenad wears an 'Ionic' himation over her chiton. Her hair falls loose and is bound with a pair of writhing serpents.</p>

<p>On the subject see Mayer <title>Giganten und Titanen</title> pp. 319-28, and Villard in <title>Rev. arch.</title> 1947 (28) pp. 5-11, publishing a stamnos by the Syleus Painter in the Louvre. A free replica of the group of Dionysos and Giant appears on a calyx-krater by the Blenheim Painter in Leningrad (<rs key="Leningrad 765" type="Vase">Leningrad 765</rs>: <title>CR.</title> 1867 pl. 6: <title>ARV.</title> p. 416, below, no. 2).

The maenad on the Bologna krater bears some resemblance to the right-hand figure on the stamnos in Boston.</p>

<p>The name of Dionysos' opponent is variously given.

<p>Ours is the only vase on which two maenads take part, and the only other vase on which a maenad hurls a rock is the Vlasto stamnos. She is inspired by the god to a feat of strength. A satyr hurls a rock in the Gigantomachy on a calyx-krater by the Niobid Painter in Ferrara (above, no. 5: not visible in the reproductions).</p>

<p>On other vases, maenads perform less strenuous duties: helping Dionysos, or a satyr, to arm, or filling the phiale of Dionysos for the libation before he goes into battle.</p>

<p>A stephane ornamented with the foreparts of four winged horses is worn by Athena on a calyx-krater by the Altamura Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 342" type="Vase">Louvre G 342</rs>: see <ref target="ii.16" n="U">ii p. 16</ref>), and by a woman, probably a goddess, on fragments of a bell-krater by the same artist in Erbach and in the Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen (Tischbein 5 pl. 111; <title>El.</title> 1 pl. 29, 1; <title>Bonner Jahrbücher</title> 96 p. 342: <title>ARV.</title> p. 414 no. 27); on an amphora by the Niobid Painter in London (<rs key="London E 257" type="Vase">London E 257</rs>: Gerhard <title>AV.</title> pl. 176, 1; <title>CV.</title> pl. 7, 2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 421 no. 41) Hera's stephane is surmounted by the forepart of a winged horse.

American Art Association, New York, Oct. 27-29, 1932</title> p. 82, no. 575), the subject of the side not reproduced is Dionysos leading Ariadne (or Semele?) by the hand: she wears 'a broad fillet surmounted over the forehead by an eagle with raised wings in the centre, flanked by springing Pegasi'. It will be noticed that these stephanai are worn by different persons, so that one can hardly attribute any special symbolic value to them.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 71, lower middle: for the stephane on the Gould vase see <title>Antike Kunst</title> 4 p. 65, right, below.</p></note></p>

<p>B. The subject is continued on the back of the vase. A satyr drives a biga drawn by two other satyrs. He holds a goad in his right hand and lays it on the shoulders of one of the pair, who looks round. The satyrs hold the reins with both hands. The peg and part of the pad are seen between the two heads, but it is not clear how the pole is kept up.</p>

<p>There are other pictures of a satyr driving a biga drawn by two of his companions:</p>

<p>In four of these vases the satyr-biga is used in the Gigantomachy, but a satyr-biga <pb xml:id="ii.72" n="72"/> occurs in different surroundings on a red-figured cup, belonging to the wider circle of the Nikosthenes Painter, in Cambridge (C. Smith <title>Forman Coll.</title> pl. 9, whence, A, Pfuhl fig. 343; <title>CV.</title> ii. R. and S. pl. 6, below: <title>ARV.</title> p. 104 no. 4): here, at a sports meeting, a biga drawn by a pair of satyrs is leading, after the turn, from a biga drawn by a pair of maenads. On a black-figured lekythos in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 1951" type="Vase">Berlin 1951</rs>: Gerhard <title>A.B.</title> pl. 17, 1) the quadriga of Dionysos is drawn by two maenads and two satyrs.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>That centaurs, too, should sometimes be forced to draw chariots is only natural: Vanderpool in <title>Hesp.</title> 7 pp. 393-8; add a Praenestine mirror, with Herakles driving a centaur-biga, in the Villa Giulia.</p>

<p>On an archaic Greek gem formerly in the Bartholdy collection, a satyr drives a chariot drawn by a pair of lions (Furtwängler <title>A.G.</title> pl. 8, 42): this is probably another scene from the Gigantomachy.</p>

<p>Caskey notes that the vase, without neck, mouth, and handles, would go into a square, and so would the two stamnoi by the Chicago Painter in Boston (Pll. 16-17: <title>ARV.</title> pp. 407-8 nos. 4 and 14; see Caskey <title>G.</title> pp. 96-7). The shape is particularly sturdy: short body, neck, and handles, broad base and foot. The stamnoi by the Altamura Painter in Lyons, Munich, and San Simeon (<title>ARV.</title> p. 414 nos. 37, 35, 36) resemble ours, but it is even more compact than the Lyons. The upright projections beside the handles are common in stamnoi down to the middle of the fifth century (see <title>EVP.</title> p. 33), and none of the Altamura Painter's stamnoi is without them. In the long run they are descended from the strap or wicker handles of leather or wicker receptacles, in which the handle is threaded into slits, passes inside, and reappears. Another shape of vase, the lekane, preserves this handle in a more easily recognizable form.</p>

<p>The design of palmettes at the handles is of the same type as in the stamnoi by the Altamura Painter. The 'adhering petals' — the end-petals cleaving to their tendril — are the rule in the group of artists to which the Altamura Painter and the Blenheim Painter belong, but sometimes occur elsewhere.</p>

<p>In <title>VA.</title> (P. 145 no. 18) and <title>Att. V.</title> (p. 335 no. 26) I counted this stamnos a work of the Altamura Painter. In <title>ARV.</title> (pp. 416-17) I picked four vases out of my old Altamura lists, one out of my old Niobid, and headed them 'Blenheim Painter' after a volute-krater in the possession of the Duke of Marlborough. The five vases are very like the Altamura Painter, and link him to the Niobid. In <title>ARV.</title> I said that they might be early Niobid; but I still prefer to keep them apart both from the Niobid Painter and from the Altamura.</p>

<p>Two Thracian women catch Orpheus by the hair; one pierces him with a long spit, the other attacks him with a sword; he tries to beat the first off with his lyre, but stumbles and falls. Three other women race up, armed with spits<note anchored="true" n="ii.72.1"><p>Helbig spoke of a goad, Edward Robinson of 'lances and staves', Guthrie of spears, but they are all spits.</p></note> and sickle.<note anchored="true" n="ii.72.2"><p>In Hauser's view (<title>Jb.</title> 29 p. 26) the sickle on our vase is simply 'the true Thracian form of knife and sword, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(/rph</foreign>, described as <foreign xml:lang="greek">ma/xaira kampu/lh</foreign>, or the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Qra|kiko\n ci/fos e)pikampe/s</foreign>, evidence for which is given by Thomaschek <title>Die alten Thraker</title> i, 119 (<title>Wiener Sitzungsberichte</title> 1893)'. I regard it as an ordinary sickle.
</p>
<p>The harpe or sickle of Perseus is sometimes seen to be a combination of knife and saw: a surgeonly instrument, the knife for the flesh and the saw for the bone.</p></note> Two Thracian youths look on, the older lurking behind a bush, the younger in a more manly attitude, <pb xml:id="ii.73" n="73"/> but not caring to interpose. Another tree or shrub marks the middle of the picture. Orpheus wears a chitoniskos, belted, and pulled down over the belt at both sides; it has a flounce over the breast. A short wrap passes over his left shoulder and is held with the left hand. High boots with fur flaps. The long hair is wreathed. The name <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*R*F*E*U*S</foreign> is written over the head. The women are not characterized as un-Hellenic. The woman in front of Orpheus, (4), wears a peplos, with kolpos as well as overfall; so does (7). (3) wears chiton with 'Ionic' himation, (6) a thinner chiton with the himation draped in the other manner, (2) a chiton only, with a long overfall, overgirt. (4), (3), and (7) have stephanai of different kinds, (2) a broad head-band, (6) a long cord; (4) and (7) wear the hair down, the rest up. All have bracelets on one arm or both. The lanky youth on the left is dressed in a chitoniskos, belted, a chlamys, and a hat, with flaps, of vaguely Thracian mode. He grasps the bush with his right hand, and holds a pair of spears across his shoulder with his left. The boy wears a chitoniskos, girt with a cord, a cloak of blanket stuff brooched at the pit of the neck, shoes, and holds a spear.</p>

<p>Under the back-handle a plant-palmette rises from the ground (Jacobsthal <title>O.</title> pl. 60, b and pp. 84-5). One woman uses a sword; but the others have armed themselves with household implements — spits and a sickle. Spits are used in most pictures of the subject; and even where the blow is being dealt with another weapon, Orpheus is sometimes seen to have been wounded already by a spit. Other household objects are the pestle — which is also used as an extemporized weapon by Trojan women in the Iliupersis<note anchored="true" n="ii.73.1"><p>On the pestle (<foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/peros</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/peron</foreign>) see A.

<p>It is curious that in the Iliupersis cup by the Brygos Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 25" type="Vase">Louvre G 25</rs>: FR. pl. 25, whence Hoppin <title>Rf.</title> p. 118 and Pfuhl figs. 419-20), where Andromache wields a <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/peros</foreign>, the Achaean warrior who corresponds to her on the other half of the picture bears the extraordinary name of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(/Uperos</foreign> (even more forcible here than <title>Malleus Scotorum</title>), and that in the picture of the Death of Priam on an Attic black-figured amphora from Monte Romano, formerly in the Mastrozzi collection, later in the possession of Alessandro Castellani (drawing R.I. 1866, 28), one of the warriors has a pair of <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(/peroi</foreign> as the device on his shield.
</p>
<p>For the name <foreign xml:lang="greek">*(/Uperos</foreign> compare Servius on <title>Aen.</title> 9, 4: 'Pilumnus et Pitumnus fratres fuerunt di: horum Pitumnus usum stercorandorum inuenit agrorum, unde et Sterculinius dictus est, Pilumnus vero pinsandi frumenti, unde et a pistoribus deus colitur; ab ipso et pilum dictum est.'

Swords, however, also appear, as here — the husbands' swords — and spears; once the bow; stones and rocks; on the Italiote calyx-krater in Amsterdam (FR. pl. 178) a woman is uprooting a tree for a weapon.

<p>Orpheus often tries to defend himself with his lyre. An unusual trait in the Boston picture is the presence of Thracian youths.

<p>Pausanias, describing the Orpheus in the Nekyia of Polygnotos at Delphi (<bibl n="Paus. 10.30.6">Paus. 10.30.6</bibl>), noted that his aspect was Greek, and neither his dress nor his head-covering Thracian. So also on the early vases. In our picture he wears high flapped boots of Thracian mode. These had long been worn by horsemen in Athens (see, for example, the cup by Euphronios in Munich, <rs key="Munich 2620" type="Vase">Munich 2620</rs>; FR. pl. 22). In a lyre-player they may perhaps indicate a Thracian, as Robert thought: but on an oinochoe of about 440 B.C. in the Art Institute at Chicago the same boots are worn by a lyre-player who cannot be Orpheus.<note anchored="true" n="ii.76.2"><p><rs key="Chicago 07.12" type="Vase">Chicago 07.12</rs>: shape II: a youth (wrap, boots, ivy-wreath) moves to left, the lyre in his left hand: Orpheus according to Fröhner (<title>Vente van Branteghem</title> no. 93). The artist is a clumsy imitator of the Chicago Painter: by the same, an oinochoe of the same shape in Naples (<rs key="Naples 3136" type="Vase">Naples 3136</rs>: phot. Sommer 11069, iv, 2: cup-bearer).</p></note> Orpheus wears a non-Greek article of clothing — a tiara — as well as boots, on a vase of about the same period as the Boston hydria, a column-krater by the Florence Painter in Ferrara (above, no. 17).</p>

<p>The Boston Orpheus hydria is large, broad, full-bodied, and flat-shouldered. The picture runs right round, regardless of the side-handles: so also in the large hydria by the Niobid Painter in Bowdoin College (back-view, Jacobsthal <title>O.</title> pl. 60, a: <title>ARV.</title> p. 423 no. 54), which is somewhat later; his fragmentary hydria in Ancona is decorated on the same principle (<title>ARV.</title> p. 423 no. 61). The fiction, old as the François vase, is that the picture was first finished, and the handles then clapped on top of it: as in fact adjuncts sometimes were in bronze vessels, for example in the Ficoroni cista. In the Orpheus hydria there is a blank space for some distance round the handles, as if the painter had distrusted the quality of the surface there. A groove, not visible in Caskey's drawing, separates the upper curve of the double-ogee foot from the lower. The upper surface of the mouth is reserved. The contours are in relief-lines. The bracelets are in brown. There is no red except for the inscription.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The Orpheus hydria was found, shortly before 1879, in an Etruscan cemetery near Foiano della Chiana (prov. Arezzo, south of Arezzo, north of Montepulciano, east of Sinalunga), and an account of the circumstances is given by Helbig in the <title>Bullettino</title> for 1879 (pp. 242-8). The exact site was north-west of Foiano, in the property of Alfonso del Soldato, on the hill rising in front of the Church of S. Francesco, about a hundred paces from the faade. When Helbig arrived, the excavators, Giuseppe Ceppannelli of Cortona and Giacomo Tempora of Bettolle, were still working in a virgin tomb consisting of two rock-cut chambers. Along the right wall of the nearer chamber were four Greek painted vases, a bronze 'pail', and a small urn of pietra fetida: all these vessels contained remains of burnt bodies. The Orpheus hydria was in the corner formed by the right wall with the entrance wall. Farther along the right wall there was a red-figured 'amphora' of rather severe style with, on one side, a man, sceptre in hand, pursuing a woman, and on the other a youth. Farther along the wall, a black-figured 'amphora'; near it, the bronze 'pail'; then a very large black-figured volute-krater with Herakles and the Lion on one side of the neck, and a battle on the other. A huge black-figure cup served as the lid of the krater: it is the cup in the manner of the Andokides Painter, <rs key="Florence 74624" type="Vase">Florence 74624</rs> (<title>ARV.</title> p. 6 no. 20).<note anchored="true" n="ii.76.3"><p>According to Milani the cup is from Bettolle, according to the museum label from Cesa near Bettolle.

<p>Height 0.68, without the handles 0.59. <title>Bull. MFA.</title> 40 pp. 11-13 (Caskey). Warriors leaving home. On the neck: A, a youth (Theseus?) pursuing a woman: B, (women). About 450 B.C., by the Niobid Painter (Caskey in <title>Bull. MFA.</title> 40 p. 13; <title>ARV.</title> p. 419 no. 11).</p>

<p>Warriors leaving home. There are three groups. The first and chief, (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>), of seven or eight figures, occupies the front of the vase, with the area of the left handle; the second, (<foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign>), of four figures, the back of the vase; the third, (<foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>), of three figures, the area of the right handle.</p>

<p>(<foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>) A young warrior, bare-headed, holds his spear in his left hand and gives his right to a woman, who holds his helmet and a second spear. Between them, a woman holds phiale and oinochoe for the parting libation. On the left, a woman holds a wreath with the ends not yet joined. On the right, a fourth woman holds a piece of linen. These five figures, as will be seen from the general view of the vase, form the true decoration of the front of the vase; for the two or three remaining figures in the group, to left of them, are not seen when one looks at the vase exactly from the front. Stepping to the left, one sees that the woman holding the wreath stands by the chair of an old man who sits watching the scene, and that a fifth woman also watches, with her hand laid on the back of the chair. These three figures are thought of as in a porch, which is indicated by a single Doric column with part of the architrave above it. To left of them in the picture is an open door, with a glimpse of a woman in the house. This part of the vase is fragmentary, and it is not certain whether the house belongs to the first scene, as is rather more likely, or to the second.</p>

<p>The libation before departure is a favourite theme in vase-painting of the end of the sixth century and of the fifth: see Furtwängler in FR. i pp. 188 and 262, and Wrede in <title>AM.</title> 41 pp. 260-2 and 313, with the earlier studies quoted by him on his p. 260 note 3. Wreaths are often held in such scenes: see Wrede ibid. pp. 262-4, Deubner in <title>ARW.</title> 30 (1933) pp. 89-90, Johansen <title>Iliaden</title> p. 64. A slighter picture of the same class as ours, on a pelike from the school of the Niobid Painter in the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco (<title>CV.</title> pl. 18, 1, pl. 19, 1, and pl. 20, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 425 no. 15) is deemed by H. R. W. Smith to represent 'the homecoming of a warrior rather than his departure, if one may stress the wreath held by the woman: he has done <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)/cia stefa/non</foreign>' (ibid. p. 38): but wreaths are in place at the departure as well as at the return. A good illustration of this is provided by a column-krater in the Hirsch collection (A, Pollak <title>Coll. Woodyat</title> pl. 3, 52: <title>ARV.</title> p. 391, Hephaistos Painter no. 13): a youth runs off, a pair of his spears in his left hand, his right hand raised in a gesture of farewell: on the right, Athena holds up a wreath; on the left, Nike holds out another. Wreaths are also held in arming-scenes, for example on a black-figured column-krater, from the Group of London B 76, in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin inv. 3763" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 3763</rs>: Johansen <title>Iliaden</title> fig. 16) and on the black-figured amphora by the Amasis Painter in New York (<rs key="New York 06.1021.69" type="Vase">New York 06.1021.69</rs>: Sambon <title>Coll. Canessa</title> pl. 14 and p. 57).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>(<foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign>) (on the reverse of the vase): a young warrior, fully armed, holds his spear and shield and extends his right hand, with a phiale, towards a woman who holds an oinochoe; on each side of the pair is a woman with a wreath, not yet tied, in her hands.</p>

<p>(<foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>) (at the right handle): a light-armed youth with two spears stands between a man in the prime of life and an old man, who holds a sprig.</p>

<p>We return to the first scene (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>) and look at it in detail.</p>

<p>The youth wears chitoniskos, leather corslet, strengthened with bronze scales in front, and sword, but no greaves; a wrap hangs over his left arm and shoulder. The hair is bobbed, with a thin fillet. The woman who holds his second spear and his helmet looks at him and takes his hand lightly. She wears a chiton, and over it, in lieu of himation, a peplos, with long overfall, overgirt, open at the right side, and leaving the left shoulder free; necklace, earring, stephane decorated with saltires and surmounted by leaves in front. The peplos is the same garment as Athena wears on the vase from which the painter takes his name, the calyx-krater in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 341" type="Vase">Louvre G 341</rs>; FR. pl. 108, whence Pfuhl fig. 492 <pb xml:id="ii.78" n="78"/> and Webster <title>Der Niobidenmaler</title> pll. 2-5; <title>CV.</title> d pl. 1; <title>Enc. phot.</title> iii p. 22; <title>ARV.</title> pp. 419-20 no. 20): except that it is let down from the left shoulder. The Corinthian helmet, which is held by the nasal, has catches on it for the insertion of plumes. These were recognized by H. R. W. Smith (<title>CV.</title> San Francisco p. 38), who quotes two examples: others are on the calyx-krater by the Geneva Painter in Geneva (FR. ii p. 314 fig. 105, whence, part, Pfuhl fig. 509; phots. Giraudon 4028-9: <title>ARV.</title> p. 430 no. 2: the helmet on the ground), on a volute-krater of the Geneva Group in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 482" type="Vase">Louvre G 482</rs>: Raoul-Rochette pl. 80: <title>ARV.</title> p. 430), and on a pelike, by one of the Mannerists, in Florence (<title>St. e mat.</title> 3 pp. 162-3; <title>CV.</title> pl. 34, 1-2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 398 no. 53); further, on two Etruscan mirrors which, as Eldridge saw, are by a single hand (<title>AJA.</title> 1917 p. 365 note 2): the Death of Ajax in Boston (<title>Harv. St.</title> 11 pl. 2, von Mach; <title>JHS.</title> 69 pl. 7, a; see also <title>EVP.</title> p. 140), and the Graiai in New York (Gerhard <title>E.S.</title>, suppl., pl. 66; Richter <title>Etruscan Art in the Museum</title> fig. 133: see also <title>JHS.</title> 67 p. 9 and 69 pl. 7, b with p. 8).</p>

<p>The woman with the phiale wears a peplos with overfall, pinned on both shoulders, a necklace, and a kerchief in the form of a thick band, set with crosses, and having leaves in front. She stands, like the youth, with both legs frontal. (Above the right shoulder of this woman, the letter <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N</foreign> was incised on the vase at some time before the black background was painted in.) The phiale is ornamented with two rows of pear-shaped or gout-shaped bosses pointing down and up: on this type see Luschey <title>Die Phiale</title> pp. 41-60. The woman on the left, in the porch, wears a thick woollen chiton of the same type as Artemis's on the amphora by the Niobid Painter in the Seillière collection (<title>El.</title> 2 pl. 90, whence FR. iii p. 284; Webster pl. 8, a: <title>ARV.</title> p. 421 no. 40), Aithra's and Priam's on his volute-krater in Bologna (<rs key="Bologna 268" type="Vase">Bologna 268</rs>: <title>Mon.</title> 11 pl. 14; Webster pl. 6: <title>ARV.</title> 418 no. 1), Priam's on his calyx-krater in Ferrara (<rs key="Ferrara T. 936" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 936</rs>: Aurigemma 1 p. 177 = 2 p. 235: <title>ARV.</title> p. 419 no. 16): the uppermost of its three divisions (each bordered below) is sometimes seen to be a flounce. Over this chiton, the woman on our vase wears a himation draped shawl-wise; necklace, small earring, head-band with leaves in front. The feet are missing, but must both have been frontal. The woman on the right of the warrior, in profile, wears chiton, himation, necklace, stephane with leaves in front; the ends of the hair are confined in a small bag. The front-hair is contoured with relief-line; so is the back-hair, and it has several wavy lines, indicating strands, within the contour. The purpose of the linen cloth in this woman's hands is not clear. In another picture of the libation before departure, on a Chicago bell-krater in the manner of the Niobid Painter (<title>AJA.</title> 1930 pp. 172-3; Webster pl. 19, a: <title>ARV.</title> p. 425 no. 9), a woman holds a piece of stuff, but it is narrower than here and of thicker material. In the picture of Achilles receiving his armour on a calyx-krater in Bologna, also in the manner of the Niobid Painter (<rs key="Bologna 291" type="Vase">Bologna 291</rs>: <title>Eos</title> 34 pl. 3, 5 and pl. 2, 4: <title>ARV.</title> p. 424 no. 3) the Nereid standing behind Achilles holds just such a piece of linen as is seen on our vase. Perhaps it is intended to wipe the sword or spear before handing to the warrior. On the arming cup by Douris in Vienna (<rs key="Vienna 3694" type="Vase">Vienna 3694</rs>; FR. pl. 53, whence Hoppin i p. 267; Pfuhl fig. 455: <title>ARV.</title> p. 280 no. 6) a youth furbishes his spear with a couple of cloths; on the arming cup by the Brygos Painter in the Vatican (<title>Mus. Greg.</title> ii pl. 81, 2; Gerhard <title>AV.</title> pll. 269-70; phots. Alinari 35809-11: <title>ARV.</title> p. 249 no. 41) a youth furbishes his spear with a cloth, and a man his corslet; a similar cloth, but larger, hangs out of the fur bag held by the old man on the interior of the cup; other cloths hang out of the fur bags hanging on the wall in the exterior pictures. (The purpose of the longer piece of stuff which is being offered to the youth who is putting his sword on is uncertain: it is small for a wrap.) One might guess that the warrior on the Boston vase will use the cloth to wipe his face with — the campaigning season was summer — but that would hardly suit the Bologna vase, and the explanation already given is more probable. The wiping or burnishing of armour is mentioned by the poets: <foreign xml:lang="greek">qwrh/kwn te neosmh/ktwn</foreign> Homer (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 13.342">Hom. Il. 13.342</bibl>): <foreign xml:lang="greek">neosmh/ktw| te maxai/rh|</foreign> Euphorion 132. One should mention, in conclusion, although they do not help, the larger pieces of stuff — chitoniskoi, I thought — sometimes held by warriors in arming scenes (<title>Kl.</title> p. 24 no. 12, p. 25 no. 29, p. 29 no. 79).</p>

<p>The sword hanging to right of this figure may either belong to this group or to group <foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>.</p>

<p>To return to the figures on the left of group <foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>. The old man, dressed in himation and <pb xml:id="ii.79" n="79"/> shoes, holds a crotched stick by the head. The little finger of his right hand has disappeared in a chip. His brow is wrinkled, his hair and beard white (in the drawing they look darker than the flesh, but are of course lighter). The woman behind him wears chiton, himation, necklace, head-band with leaves. The skull is bordered with relief-line. She rests her right hand on the back of the old man's chair, and her left hand on her right forearm; her head is slightly bent. She is the youngest of the women, and young sister rather than maid. The warrior's shield hangs on the wall, and under it, by a cord, an uncertain object, open at the end. According to H. R. W. Smith the same object is carried by the young man who accompanies Amphiaraos at his departure on a bell-krater by the Danae Painter in Syracuse (<title>ML.</title> 14 pl. 4 and p. 66: <title>ARV.</title> p. 666 no. 7). That, however, must be the same as appears, in the same circumstances, on a neck-amphora in the manner of Polygnotos formerly in the Gargiulo collection (Inghirami pl. 25; Raoul-Rochette pl. 71, 2, whence Roscher s.v. Telamon p. 235 = s.v. Teukros p. 422; Gargiulo <title>Recueil</title> ii pl. 33; Overbeck <title>Gal.</title> pl. 13, 7: <title>ARV.</title> p. 700 no. 79): Ajax is taking leave of his parents, and his squire Teukros, light-armed, stands beside him carrying the luggage on his back, a sort of bag or holdall strapped round his neck. On such figures of squires or attendants carrying baggage see Jacobsthal <title>Mel. Reliefs</title> pp. 86-8; see also Studniczka in <title>Jb.</title> 31 p. 176. It does not seem to me certain that the object on the Boston vase is the same as on the krater in Syracuse: if it is, it is a bag or holdall, not yet filled. The same thing, or the end of it, may be represented in the departure-scene on a neck-amphora by the Niobid Painter in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 280" type="Vase">Oxford 280</rs>: Millingen <title>PVA.</title> pll. 55-6; Gardner pl. 12; hardly visible in <title>CV.</title> pl. 16, 3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 422 no. 46).</p>

<p>The device on the shield is a chariot-wheel. This is one of the few charges used by the Niobid Painter and his companions. The rich and varied heraldry of archaic art declines in the early classic period, and the scores of brilliant devices soon shrink to a handful. In Aeschylus heraldry, like much else that is archaic, sets in splendour: but to a herald it is ominous that the pageantry of the <title>Seven against Thebes</title> culminates in a magnificent negation:</p>
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>sh=ma d' ou)k e)ph=n ku/klw|.</l></quote>
<p>Euripides has some heraldry in the <title>Phoenissae</title>, but it is poor and forced. Of course there is the shield of the Parthenos: but that is not heraldry.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The slender Doric column represents a wooden porch or colonnade. A necking is shown above the flutes, then a spreading and very convex echinus, then shallow epistyle, reglets, frieze. The wooden building at the left extremity of the group is fragmentary: but we see, below, a base or sill, no doubt of stone, and, above, a simple architrave, a gable, and acroteria. The supports are not columns, but plain wooden posts. Between them we see the two panels of the open door. The jambs are not shown, are thought of as concealed by the posts. The cross-plank at the foot of each panel is ornamented with the usual rows of large nails. There were no doubt similar cross-pieces at the top and halfway up. There is also a row of nails at the edge of each panel. This is such an erection as appears on the Campanian bell-krater, with Orestes and Iphigenia, in the Louvre (Bulle <title>Eine Skenographie</title> p. 15; Pickard-Cambridge <title>The Theatre of Dionysus in Athens</title> fig. 58).</p>

<p>A woman stands inside the door. The lower part of her chiton is preserved. Her feet are not shown. She must have been watching, and was probably standing frontal, with head turned to the right. Perhaps the wife of the old man, and mother or grandmother to the warrior. Figures of women, half-seen through the open door, sitting or standing, are not infrequent in vase-painting from the François vase onwards: three examples only: the pyxis <rs key="London E 773" type="Vase">London E 773</rs>, by a follower of Douris (FR. pl. 57, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 537 no. 41); a calyx-krater, from the Group of Polygnotos, in Tarquinia (<title>Jb.</title> 34 p. 133: <title>ARV.</title> p. 698 no. 59); the pyxis <rs key="London 1920.12-21.1" type="Vase">London 1920.12-21.1</rs>, by the Marlay Painter (<title>JHS.</title> 41 pl. 6, 1-2 and 4-5 and p. 144: <title>ARV.</title> p. 767 no. 15). Caskey took our figure for a statue, but this does not seem probable.</p>

<p>(<foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign>) The young warrior, standing with both legs frontal, wears chitoniskos, leather corslet, helmet, and over his shoulders a wrap; holds spear and shield The helmet, of Attic type, has a snake on the inside of the raised cheek-piece, and a row of leaves on the <pb xml:id="ii.80" n="80"/> upper edge of the combined frontlet and nasal. The shoulder-piece is ornamented with a quatrefoil. Part of the baldric is seen at the right shoulder. The shield-device is again a chariot-wheel. The phiale, with its omphalos, is drawn in three-quarter view. The woman standing with both legs frontal, facing the warrior, has an oinochoe in her hand. She wears a peplos, with overfall, overgirt, and pinned at the shoulders; a necklace, a head-cord. The contours of front-hair and bun are in relief-lines. The two other women, who hold wreaths, are dressed in chiton and himation; the left-hand one has a broad band round her head, with a pattern of crosses, and leaves in front. The contour of the hair is in relief-lines. The collar-bone and the sinew of the neck are in brown. The other woman has a stephane with embattled forepart. The outline of the skull is in relief. The column differs in small particulars from that on A: there are no reglets, and the frieze has a more Doric look.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>(<foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>) The legs of the youth are again frontal. He wears a chlamys and a baldric. What one sees at his left shoulder is the edge of a pilos or petasos slung round his neck. He holds a pair of spears in his left hand, and his right arm is akimbo. Brown lines for the collar-bone and on the neck. The skull of the man facing him is contoured with relief-line, and his ear, in relief-lines, shows through his hair. Brown lines for the serratus magnus. He wears a himation; so does the old man on the other side, but under it he has a thick woollen chiton, of the same material as those of the woman with the wreath in group <foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>, and of Priam on the volute-krater by the Niobid Painter in Bologna and his calyx-krater in Ferrara (<title>Mon.</title> 11 pl. 14, Webster pl. 6; Aurigemma 1 p. 177 = 2 p. 235: <title>ARV.</title> pp. 418-19 nos. 1 and 16). His hair and beard are white. Both men are wreathed and have sticks, and the older holds a sprig in his left hand. These sprigs were in place at departures as well as in many other junctures, and are often represented in such scenes: three examples will suffice: the black-figured hydria, by the Painter of <rs key="Louvre F 6" type="Vase">Louvre F 6</rs>, in London (<rs key="London B 51" type="Vase">London B 51</rs>: Rumpf <title>Sakonides</title> pl. 11), the stamnos by the Eucharides Painter in Würzburg (<title>BSA.</title> 18 pl. 15; Langlotz pl. 185: <title>ARV.</title> p. 155 no. 29), and the bell-krater, already cited, in Chicago (above, <ref target="ii.78" n="U">ii p. 78</ref>).</p>

<p>After the splendid proto-volute-krater of Ergotimos, and the less successful efforts of Nikosthenes and others, the volute-krater reached its canonical form in the late sixth century and early fifth: good examples of this stage are a black-figured krater in Boston (<rs key="Boston 90.153" type="Vase">Boston 90.153</rs>: Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 121) and the red-figured, decorated by the Berlin Painter, in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 468" type="Vase">London E 468</rs>: <title>Berl.</title> pll. 29-31: <title>ARV.</title> p. 138 no. 102); the krater decorated by Euphronios in Arezzo would have been as good an example, if the foot had been preserved. Our vase is still of the same type as in the earlier vases: all that has altered is the relation of the two parts of the foot: the upper member has shrunk at the expense of the lower. The proportions are somewhat different: the vase is taller and the body slopes less towards the base. The volute-krater <rs key="Boston 00.347" type="Vase">Boston 00.347</rs> (Pl. LXI), decorated by a follower of the Niobid Painter, is very like ours. The potters of the second quarter of the fifth century modified the shape by elaborating the mouldings of the neck and mouth, and exchanging the old foot for a double-ogee. The older variety persisted by the side of the new models till the middle of the century, then disappeared. Both new and old were used by the Altamura Painter, the Niobid Painter, and their school: it might have been expected that the earlier of their vases would be of the old type, the later of the new: but it is not so.</p>

<p>The composition stresses the verticals. The treatment of the drapery varies with the garment: in the thin chitons, long, dense, equable, parallel lines; in the thick chitons, no folds; in the peploi, sparse folds, long straight lines with short straight lines at an acute angle to the lower end; in the himation, curved lines of freer course; eye-folds in some of the himatia and peploi.</p>

<p>In the small picture on the front of the neck, a youth or man runs to right, a pair of spears held at his side in his right hand, his left hand extended to lay hold of a woman who flees, looking round. She is preceded by a companion, also fleeing and looking back. <pb xml:id="ii.81" n="81"/> On the right, an old man stands with both legs frontal, a stick in his hand, looking away from the pursuit and towards a woman who runs towards it. A Doric column is seen between, and she is thought of as running out of her house. On the right, a sash is seen hanging. Not much remains of the figure to left of the pursuer: a woman runs towards an old man who stands facing her, holding a stick: she looks back towards the chief group. Behind him is a flaming altar, with the usual smears on the side, and a palm-tree behind it (partly restored); then a woman moving to left, in alarm, looking round. Then, only partly shown, a chair with cushion and footstool.</p>

<p>The pursuer wears a chlamys, the men himatia; the old man on the right, shoes. The women, in order of mention, peplos with overfall, stephane, necklace; chiton with kolpos, and wrap worn shawl-wise, necklace, broad head-band with leaves; chiton, himation, head-band; chiton, himation, broad head-band; peplos with overfall, stephane. Brown inner markings on the body of the pursuer.</p>

<p>This picture is very like the subsidiary pictures on two other volute-kraters by the Niobid Painter: on the front of the neck in Bologna (<rs key="Bologna 269" type="Vase">Bologna 269</rs>) (<title>Mon.</title> 10 pl. 54; Webster pl. 13: <title>ARV.</title> p. 418 no. 7); on the back of the neck in Naples (<rs key="Naples 2421" type="Vase">Naples 2421</rs>) (Gargiulo <title>Recueil</title> ii pl. 56; Schulz <title>Amazonenvase</title>; <title>ARV.</title> p. 419 no. 12).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In the many pictures where a youth dressed in a chlamys and holding a pair of spears pursues a woman it is customary to leave the figures unidentified. Yet there is evidence. On a bell-krater by the Komaris Painter in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre G 423" type="Vase">Louvre G 423</rs>: <title>CV.</title> d pl. 23, 1 and 3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 718, above, no. 5) the youth is inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*E*S*E*U*S</foreign> (see <title>JHS.</title> 47 p. 147); on a hydria from Sorrento, on the outskirts of the Polygnotan Group, in Worcester, Massachusetts (<rs key="Worcester 1903.38" type="Vase">Worcester 1903.38</rs>: Phot. R.I. 2953, 1), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*E*S*E*U*S</foreign>. I am therefore inclined to call the youth on the Boston vase Theseus. The woman is hard to name. On a fragment of a lekane in Leningrad (<title>CR.</title> 1877 pl. 5, 6) the youth with chlamys and spears is inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*H*S*E*U*S</foreign> The woman is also named: but unfortunately the painter made a slip and wrote <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*E*T*I*S</foreign> by confusion with pictures of Thetis pursued by Peleus: so we must still wait.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I have placed a query after the identification as Theseus is that Peleus also, it seems, was sometimes represented in the same guise as Theseus, holding spears: on the stand of a nuptial lebes in the Robinson Collection at Baltimore (<title>CV.</title> ii pll. 50-1 c) a youth holding spears pursues a woman: at the end of the picture the painter has placed a dolphin: he would appear, therefore, to have intended this pair for Peleus and Thetis. There is, however, some looseness in the use of dolphins: in the Boreas and Oreithyia of the Niobid Painter on his hydria in Bowdoin College (<title>ARV.</title> p. 423 no. 54) the last woman on the right holds a dolphin; on a lekythos in Athens (<rs key="Athens 12891" type="Vase">Athens 12891</rs>) a woman holds a dolphin in one hand, a thyrsus in the other. These may all be slips: but they make one hesitate.</p>

<p>The picture on the reverse of the neck is fragmentary: the middle is missing. On the left of the gap, a woman standing to left, with a sceptre which is ornamented barber's-pole-wise; facing her a woman with a phiale and a sprig; then a third, frontal, head to left, both forearms raised. On the right of the gap, a woman standing to left, with a sprig; then another, frontal, with sceptre and sprig; then a Doric column, with indication of the frieze, and a cushioned seat, half seen; then a woman standing to left, her right forearm extended. The women all wear chiton and himation. The first woman on the left has a stephane, the next a head-band; the left-hand figure on the right a head-band with leaves, the two others stephanai. There may have been an altar in the missing part.</p>

<p>A good deal of the maeander on the mouth of the vase and below the picture, and of the palmette-ornament on the neck, is restored. In all four pictures the contours are in relief-lines. The only touch of red is for the head-fillet of the warrior on A. The vase must have been painted about 450: it belongs to the later period of the Niobid Painter, the same period as the calyx-krater in the Louvre from which he has been given his name; and is one of his finest works: austere, yet not without feeling, within the limits of heroic bearing.</p>

<p>In shape, the vase resembles the larger and more important volute-krater by the Niobid Painter (no. 108). The drawing is by one of his followers, the Painter of the Berlin Hydria.</p>

<p>Three figures on each side. A: on the right, Apollo, wreathed with laurel, dressed in a himation, holds out a phiale in his right hand; his bow is in his left, and the laurel-staff leans lightly on his left forearm. Artemis stands in the middle, frontal, but looking towards him, an oinochoe in her right hand and in her left his lyre. She wears a chiton and over it a short peplos-like himation, with overfall, open down the right side, fastened with two pins on the right shoulder but leaving the left shoulder and breast free: it is the same garment as is worn by the woman holding the helmet on the front of the volute-krater by the Niobid Painter (<ref target="ii.77" n="U">ii p. 77</ref>). The necklace has a bead in the middle. The hair is bound with a thin cord passing thrice round the head. On the left of the picture, Leto holds a wreath. She wears a chiton of thicker material, girt twice so as to form two kolpoi; a himation, shawl-wise; a veil; a stephane with leaves in front; a necklace. A Doric column, with some slight indication of the frieze, indicates a building, probably the porch of a temple; and a pair of bull's horns, fixed on the wall, a sanctuary: perhaps Delphi, or Delos.</p>

<p>Relief-lines contour the faces, bodies, and some parts of the clothes. Brown inner markings in the figure of Apollo; a crinkled brown line follows the edge of his himation; the sterno-mastoid of Leto is in brown. The phiale is of the same type as in the volute-krater by the Niobid Painter (<ref target="ii.78" n="U">ii p. 78</ref>), but it has only one row of 'pear-drops'. The lyre has eight strings instead of seven, and there is a slip in the tongue-pattern above the picture, between the head of Apollo and the horns.</p>

<p>There are other examples, as is natural, of one deity holding, for the moment, the property of another. On a pelike by the Hephaistos Painter in Leningrad (<title>Gaz. arch.</title> 1876 pl. 32: <title>ARV.</title> p. 391 no. 25) Artemis holds Apollo's lyre. On a calyx-krater, by the Kekrops Painter, in the collection of Prince Philip of Hesse (<title>ARV.</title> p. 53 no. 1), Artemis holds a torch in one hand and Apollo's lyre in the other. On a lekythos by the Alkimachos Painter in Boston (<rs key="Boston 95.39" type="Vase">Boston 95.39</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 358 no. 47) Hermes holds the sceptre of Zeus, whose hands are otherwise engaged.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Apollo is a favourite theme with the Niobid Painter, the Altamura Painter, and their followers. The tone of their Apollonian pictures has been well described by Pfeiff (<title>Apollon</title> pp. 105-6).</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.83" n="83"/>
<p>Artemis is usually given her bow in these pictures. It is curious that Apollo should be shorter than the two goddesses.</p>

<p>B. The reverse is much less careful, and there are no relief-lines for the contours. Three women. The middle one stands frontal, with head to left, holding phiale and sceptre, at an altar. The second, on the left, holds an oinochoe and a sprig; the third, on the right, extends her hands in prayer. It is the priestess and her attendants. All three wear chiton and himation. The priestess has a stephane, embattled in front; a cord passes twice round the head of the second; the third has a broad head-band.</p>

<p>The topside of the mouth is reserved, and so are the backs of the handle-flanges. The upper section of the foot has a reserved edge. The rays at the base are a rather old-fashioned feature in the volute-krater, but they occur on some of those by the Altamura Painter, on the Blenheim Painter's, and on those by the Niobid Painter in Bologna, Palermo, and the Louvre (<title>ARV.</title> pp. 418-19 nos. 1, 2, and 15).</p>

Graffito <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E</foreign>.</p>

<p>The chief studies of the vase are by Eduard Schwartz in <title>Annali</title> 1882 pp. 290-9 and Jacobsthal in <title>Aktaions Tod</title> (extract from <title>Marburger Jahrbuch für Kunstwissenschaft</title> 5) pp. 9 and 11-18. See also above, <ref target="ii.46" n="U">ii pp. 46-8</ref>.</p>

<p>This is a very different Death of Actaeon from the Pan Painter's (No. 94), in quality as well as in treatment. The drawing is somewhat listless: one cannot help feeling that the artist may have painted the subject, in the same terms, several times already. We have, in fact, on a fragment of a calyx-krater from Gela, in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 289" type="Vase">Oxford 289</rs>: <title>VA.</title> p. 75; <title>CV.</title> pl. 25, 6), part of a replica by the same painter, but whether it is a little earlier than our picture or a little later one cannot say.</p>

<p>Hilly ground is indicated by white lines, with a plant. Actaeon (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*K*T*A*I*O*N</foreign>) half kneels, at bay, on the hill-side. Two of his hounds bite him and he turns to defend himself against a third, striking downward with his spears and holding out his left hand with the cloak wrapped round it to ward the creature off. This and the Oxford replica are the earliest pictures in which Actaeon is represented as partly transformed into a stag: not only has he antlers and animal ears, but his forehead, nose, and cheeks are covered with fur — rendered by brown stippling which is omitted in the old drawing and does not come out properly in the photograph. The face is in a near-profile three-quarter view. Figures in the same general attitude are not uncommon from the second half of the fifth century onwards: Jacobsthal gives a list (<title>Akt.</title> pp. 11-12): and later figures of Actaeon, on Italiote vases of the fourth century, are recognizably constructed on the same lines as ours. See also Lippold <title>Ladas</title> p. 21.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Actaeon's sword hangs from a baldric at his side. He wears boots, with fur flaps distinguished by a wash of brown. This is clear on the left leg; the drawing of the fore-shortened right leg is loose, but the brown fur flap can be seen between the knee and the <pb xml:id="ii.84" n="84"/> profile foot. The right elbow, with part of the upper arm, is modern. The uppermost hound has his tail between his legs. The right-hand one wears a collar.</p>

<p>In earlier pictures Artemis either sets the hounds at Actaeon, or stands by motionless while they do their work. Here she stands by motionless, and a new figure in vase-painting, Lyssa (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*U*S*A</foreign>), personification of Madness or Rabies, runs forward urging the hounds on. Her lips are parted. She wears a chitoniskos; over it, a coat with long sleeves; over that a pelt, girt; high laced boots. The pelt is covered with an uneven brown wash. The sleeved coat has a black border and a pattern of voided squares. Above the crown of her head, as if growing from it, is the head of a small hound, with alert look and ears pricked up. This is a very unusual feature. Jacobsthal well says that 'hundreds of years before this, Lyssa would have been shown as a hound-headed woman. The classic age avoids the monstrous, or mitigates it. In the Hades of Polygnotos at Delphi, Actaeon, in human form, sits on a stag's pelt and holds a young stag in his hand; Callisto, the she-bear, only sits on a bearskin; and Eurynomos, once a bird-headed demon, rests on a vulture-skin — as Cecrops, once snake-footed, has a snake beside him in the West Pediment of the Parthenon.' The analogy would be exact, if Lyssa's hound-head were part of a stephane: but there is no indication of this, it seems to grow from the head itself. The lower part of the hair, with neck and shoulder, is modern: and it might perhaps be thought that what remains was part of a complete animal sitting on Lyssa's shoulder: but it is not likely: we are familiar with photographs of the successful novelist, beret on head, pipe in face, cat on shoulder: but I do not remember anything like it in antiquity.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 84, line 21. See, however, Winter <title>Die Typen der figürlichen Terrakotten</title> i p. 213, 6.</p></note></p>

<p>The only parallels I can remember to this hound-head are on two black-figured vases: a cup in Naples, described above (<ref target="ii.57" n="U">ii p. 57</ref>), and a small handleless mastoid in the Museo Artistico Industriale in Rome, published by Mercklin in <title>RM.</title> 38-9 p. 82 (part, clearer, <title>Mouseion</title> 33-4 p. 115, above, left). The style of the mastoid recalls the neck-amphorae signed Nikosthenes. A chorus of eight naked youths, in Indian file, dance, accompanied by a flute-player. Each of the five foremost has on his head a second human head, small, beardless. The relation between the two heads is the same as in the Boston vase: there is no sign of attachment. The small head on these vases seems to be not so much a mask as a sort of token disguise; and so it may be in the figure of Lyssa on the Boston vase, where it may have been borrowed, without much excuse, from the stage.<note anchored="true" n="ii.84.1"><p>A somewhat similar device appears on a small black-figured neck-amphora, with double handles, in Naples, by the Diosphos Painter. On A, a man pursues a woman; on B, two women flee. All three women have small birds on their heads. On A, Tereus and Procne? On B, Procne (again) and Philomele? In any case the birds would seem to indicate metamorphoses.
</p>
<p>At the last moment I can add a red-figured parallel. On a cup by the Stieglitz Painter in the Louvre one of the pictures outside shows a youth or man (the head is missing), with a drawn sword, pursuing a woman who flees; another woman also flees, preceding her; but their escape is as it were cut off by a man with a sword; at the other end of the picture two men or youths make off, one dressed in a himation, the other wearing a chitoniskos like the attackers and holding a pair of spears; the upper halves of these two are missing. Above — behind — the crown of the chief woman's head one sees, tiny, the upper part of an animal's head, frontal: it might be either feline ('panther') or canine. It is hard to say what the subject is: not Peleus and Thetis, since the attacker has a companion if not two; I thought of Perseus pursuing the maenads, but am uncertain.</p></note><note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 84, note 1. Another explanation of the Naples cup is given by Latte in <title>Festschrift zur Feier des zweihundertjährigen Bestehen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen</title> ii pp. 67-74.
</p>
<p>Tereus pursues Procne and Philomele (who have small birds on their heads) on the early classic column-krater which contains the ashes of Luigi Pirandello at Agrigento. I owe photographs to the kindness of Mrs. Paola Zancani Montuoro; the birds are not visible in the small photograph published by Griffo, <title>Il Museo Civico di Agrigento</title> p. 29, 1.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The right knee and part of the chiton above it are modern.</p>

<p>Lyssa appears in the <title>Herakles</title> of Euripides, and appeared earlier in the <bibl><title>Xantriai</title> of Aeschylus (fr. 169 Nauck)</bibl>; whether also in Aeschylus' play about Actaeon, the <bibl><title>Toxotides</title></bibl>, we should be glad to know. In Virgil, Allecto maddens the hounds of Ascanius: 'hic subitam canibus rabiem Cocytia virgo obicit' (<bibl><title>Aen.</title> 7, 479</bibl>). The form of the name on our vase, Lyssa for the Attic Lytta, is probably due to the influence of poetry.<note anchored="true" n="ii.84.2"><p>Jacobsthal (<title>Akt.</title> p. 16 note 30) does not state Wilamowitz's argument quite correctly: what Wilamowitz pointed to was <foreign xml:lang="greek">ss</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">tt</foreign>, not <foreign xml:lang="greek">s</foreign> for <foreign xml:lang="greek">ss</foreign>.</p></note> The single sigma for the double is common. The winged woman who stands beside Actaeon on a later vase, an Apulian Panathenaic amphora (of A.P. style) in Berlin (<rs key="Berlin 3239" type="Vase">Berlin 3239</rs>: Gerhard <title>Ap. Vb.</title> pl. 6, whence <title>El.</title> pl. 103; Jacobsthal <title>Akt.</title> p. 12), is not inscribed, but may be Lyssa.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me why the painter has clothed Lyssa in a sleeved coat, the Persian kandys. It is worn by Amazons as part of their Oriental costume; and from the later part <pb xml:id="ii.85" n="85"/> of the fifth century onwards it is not infrequently worn by ordinary women and by children. A sleeved garment like this would be useful to a kennel-maid; and Lyssa may be conceived of in that capacity.</p>

<p>Artemis (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*R*T*E*M*I*S</foreign>) stands still. Her bow is in her left hand at her side, and with her right hand she holds out her torch. On an Apulian volute-krater in the Jatta collection at Ruvo (<title>AZ.</title> 1844 pl. 15), while Erinys binds Theseus, Persephone holds out her torches towards the pair. In both cases the aim is perhaps not so much to give light as to produce heat, the heat of rage and madness: at least Lyssa-like figures in later art — Oistros and Apate as well as Erinys — are given torches with that intention.</p>

<p>The goddess wears a chiton, and over it a short mantle fastened on one shoulder somewhat like a chlamys. Her hair is confined in a broad band. The quiver is at the left shoulder. Part of the left hand is modern, and a little of the mantle.</p>

<p>The figure corresponding, on the other side of the picture, to Artemis is Zeus, looking on, leaning forward, his left foot planted on raised ground, a sceptre in his right hand, the thunderbolt in his left. The head is wreathed. A light wrap rests on the left shoulder and arm: the top of the sceptre, part of the bolt, the right shoulder, parts of the right hand and of breast and middle are missing. This is almost the only 'Death of Actaeon' in which Zeus is present:<note anchored="true" n="ii.85.1"><p>On a fragment of a Sicilian relief-vase, late fifth century, from Agrigento, in Copenhagen (<title>Acta arch.</title> 16 p. 140), the seated figure to right of Actaeon is probably, as Breitenstein says, Zeus.</p></note> and his presence alludes, as Schwartz pointed out (<title>Annali</title> 1882 p. 297), to the early version of the story, in which the fate of Actaeon was due to his having dared to woo Semele, the favourite of Zeus (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.4.4">Apollod. 3.4.4</bibl>, quoting an old poem: see <ref target="ii.46" n="U">ii p. 46</ref>).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The inscription is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*I*O*S</foreign>. The old practice of writing the names of persons in the genitive had not died out, and there are several examples of it in the Group of Polygnotos, to which the Lykaon Painter belongs: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*S*T*O*R*O*S</foreign> on the Oxford stamnos by Polygnotos (<title>CV.</title> pl. 29, 1-2 and pl. 30, 1-2: <title>ARV.</title> p. 677 no. 3), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*I*O*S</foreign> on his hydria in Brussels (<title>CV.</title> d pl. 9, 1: <title>ARV.</title> p. 681 no. 61), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*L*P*E*N*O*R*O*S</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*R*M*O</foreign> on the Boston pelike by the Lykaon Painter himself (<ref target="ii.88" n="U">ii p. 88</ref>).</p>

<p>Above the name of Aktaion, near the upper border of the picture, is the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*A*I*O*N</foreign>. It is not followed by a <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos</foreign>, but the name occurs with <foreign xml:lang="greek">kalos</foreign> on several other vases (<title>ARV.</title>. p. 923). One of them, a pelike in London, is by the Lykaon Painter. Another, a white lekythos in Heidelberg, adds the patronymic <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*S*X*U*L*O</foreign>: this is in all probability Euaion the son of the poet and himself a writer of tragedies (<title>AJA.</title> 1929 pp. 365-6): but it is not certain that the Lykaon Painter's Euaion is the same: the Heidelberg lekythos is somewhat earlier than his vases. The Lykaon Painter has left a portrait of his Euaion: on a bell-krater, from Sorrento, in Naples (<rs key="Naples Stg. 281" type="Vase">Naples Stg. 281</rs>: A, phot. Sommer 10109: <title>ARV.</title> p. 691 no. 9), Euaion takes part in a symposion with his friends Euainetos, Kallias, and another: they are watching a young girl dancing the pyrrhic, and Euaion accompanies her on the flute.<note anchored="true" n="ii.85.2"><p>The man on the left is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*A*I*N*E*T*O*S</foreign>; the youth who shares his couch is not named, but has <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign> written above him. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*L*I*A*S</foreign> is the companion of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*A*I*O*N</foreign>. The girl (face repainted) is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A*R:*I*S*T*E</foreign>. The third letter is more like a rho than anything else; there is room for one letter, or possibly two, between it and the iota. The name ought to be Panariste, but if so the painter has misspelt it, perhaps by metathesis, and this in fragmentary inscriptions one does not care to assume.</p></note></p>

<p>To compare the Oxford fragment (<title>VA.</title> p. 75; <title>CV.</title> pl. 25, 6): it is a free replica, and the differences are obvious. As for quality, the Actaeon is as good, the Artemis worse, the hound better.</p>

<p>On the bf. alabastron <rs key="Athens 12767" type="Vase">Athens 12767</rs> (Jacobsthal <title>Akt.</title> p. 3 fig. 5) see Haspels <title>ABL.</title> p. 183, and <title>ARV.</title> p. 492; on the Etruscan calyx-krater <rs key="London F 480" type="Vase">London F 480</rs> (Jacobsthal p. 15), <title>EVP.</title> p. 136.</p>

<p>On the reverse of the vase, three hastily drawn figures: a youth in the middle, a woman running to him, another woman running away and looking back at him. The artist can hardly have meant these three to have any connexion with the main scene.</p>

<p>The faces on the obverse have relief-contour; so have, in Zeus, the nape, and part of the right thigh and of the right calf; in Actaeon, nape, horns, ears; in Artemis the right hand, the left forearm, parts of bow and quiver. The hound-head worn by Lyssa has relief-contour, except the ears and neck. The minor markings of the male figures are in brown lines, not all of which appear in the photograph. On the obverse, the cornea of the eye is brown; except in Artemis, it is contoured in relief and has a relief dot. The ground-lines, and the vetch-like plants, are in white; so are the inscriptions, the wreath of Zeus, the flame of his thunderbolt, and on the reverse the head-fillet of the youth and the head-cord of the woman on the left.</p>

<p>The bell-krater is one of the many that have a small ledge, decorated with egg-pattern, between mouth and body. The foot is somewhat unusual, in two degrees: the side of the upper degree is reserved, of the lower black. There is a jog on the topside of the foot, near the edge. The topside of the foot between jog and edge is reserved, but the corner is black.</p>

<p>We cannot do better than quote Caskey's description of the vase (<title>Bull. MFA.</title> 32 pp. 39-44):</p>

<p>'The picture recently acquired by the Museum decorates the front of a two-handled jar of the shape known as a pelike. The vase is unusually large: it is nearly nineteen inches high, with a capacity of six gallons; the three figures are drawn on a large scale on the black ground, which measures ten inches between the upper and lower borders. Since the artist has followed the Homeric account with remarkable fidelity, it seems worth while to repeat, as far as possible in the poet's words,<note anchored="true" n="ii.87.1"><p>'In Shaw's translation.'</p></note> that portion of the tale which refers to the meeting with Elpenor. When Odysseus and his men became impatient to continue their homeward voyage after a year spent on the island of Aeaea, Circe fulfilled her promise to set them on their way, and gave them directions for their next journey "to a strange destination, even so far as the house of Hades and dread Persephone, to seek counsel of the spirit of Teiresias of Thebes, that sightless prophet whose integrity of judgment has survived death... set mast, hoist sail, and then sit quietly. The northern airs will bring you thither. When you have cut across the river of Ocean you will find Persephone's shore and her grove of tall poplars and seed-blighted willows. Beach your ship there by the deep eddying Ocean stream and make your own way down to the dank house of Hades. There Pyriphlegethon (with Cocytus a tributary of the water of Styx) runs into Acheron; by a rock the two roaring rivers meet. When there, hero, step very near the face of the stream and dig a pit — like this — about a cubit each way, and pour a drink-offering around it to all the dead.... When thus with prayers you have entreated the grave's worshipful populations, slay for them a ram and a black ewe.... Then many wraiths will repair to you of the dead who have died.... Draw the sharp sword from your hip and sit with it ready, sternly preventing anyone of the shambling dead from coming near the blood till you have had your word with Teiresias." In the morning they set forth, all except Elpenor "the youngest (no great fighter and loose-minded)", who during the bustle of departure had fallen from the roof of Circe's house and broken his neck. Having reached the spot which Circe had described, Odysseus beheaded the two sheep across the pit. "Then from out of Erebus they flocked to me, the dead spirits of those who had died. Brides came and lads; old men and men of sad experience; tender girls aching from their first agony; and many fighting men showing the stabbed wounds of brazen spears — war-victims, still in their blooded arms. All thronged to the trench and ranged restlessly this side of it and that with an eerie wailing.... The first I knew was the spirit of my fellow, Elpenor, whose body was not yet interred under the ample ground. We had left him unwept and unburied in the halls of Circe, for that these other labours came upon us urgently. When I saw him I had compassion and sharply cried across to him: 'Elpenor, how come you here into the gloomy shades? Your feet have been quicker than my ship.' He in a thin wail answered me: 'Son of Laertes, ready Odysseus, the harsh verdict of some god sealed my doom, together with my own unspeakable excess in wine. I had lain down on Circe's housetop to sleep off this drunkenness, but awoke still too confused to descend from the roof by the long ladder. Instead I plunged headlong over the parapet and broke my neckbone in its socket: hence my spirit has come down here to Hades. Yet I implore you, my Lord, to remember me as you go past homeward; for of my sure knowledge your returning must be by Aeaea. My Lord, I adjure you by those left behind, those not among us — by your wife and by the father who cared for you when you were a little child, as by Telemachus, the babe you had to leave in your house alone — do not abandon me unwept and unburied, lest I be the pawn to bring upon you God's wrath: but consume my body in fire, with those arms and armour which remain mine, and heap over the ashes a mound at the edge of the sea where the surf breaks white, for a token telling of an unhappy man to aftertime; and when the rites are completed fix above my mound the oar that in life I pulled among my fellows.' Thus he said and I promised him: 'Luckless one, all these things will I see done, exactly.' <title>So we two sat there, exchanging regrets, I with my sword held out stiffly across the blood-pool and the wraith of my follower beyond it, telling his tale</title>."</p>

<p>'This last sentence reads almost like a description of the picture on the vase, save for the introduction of Hermes, who plays no part in this episode of the Odyssey. The artist may have added him from a mixture of motives: partly because he wanted a composition with three figures, partly because one of the functions of Hermes was to conduct the souls of the dead to the lower world; it is also possible that the god appeared in a tragedy dealing with this theme.</p>

<p>'Some details of the picture, hard to see in photographs or even on the vase itself, appear more clearly in the drawing in which the doubly curved surface of the pelike has been flattened into a plane. Such are the lines in thinned paint indicating the inner markings on the bodies, the fleece of the sheep, the shading on the hat of Odysseus, and the like. The inscriptions giving the names of the three figures,<note anchored="true" n="ii.88.1"><p>'Elpenor's name is given in the genitive. This might be taken to mean "(ghost) of Elpenor". But Hermes is also labelled "of Hermes". And on another vase in the Museum, which is attributed to the same hand, the name of Zeus is in the genitive, while those of Artemis and other figures are in the nominative. It seems safer to draw no conclusions from these variations in the forms of names. The painter was not a faultless speller: he has omitted the second letter of Hermes' name; and similar mistakes occur on other vases decorated by him.'</p></note> the contours of the rocky landscape, the reeds behind Elpenor, the pit with the blood of the sheep dripping into it were added in the form of a thick yellowish-white pigment applied on the black ground. Except for one small fragment these details have flaked off; but it is still possible to make them out, since the surface they covered lacks its characteristic lustre. This indication of scenery, though sketchy, is unusually elaborate, and interesting besides as showing how closely the artist followed Homer. The tall reeds with their tops waving in the wind suggest the proximity of the rivers. And the rock at their confluence is represented by the undulating line extending to the upper border of the picture. Elpenor, whose legs from the knees down are hidden in a depression of the ground, leans his body and raised left arm against this rock, the hand grasping a projection from it, while his right hand, planted on another rock, gives him the additional support he needs. Like Agamemnon, who appears later in the story, "no longer had he substance to stand firm or the vigorously free movements such as once filled his supple limbs". Odysseus sits quietly in an attitude more familiar in Greek vase painting, his head propped on his hand, gazing sorrowfully into the staring eyes of his comrade. He is in the prime of life and strength; his muscular arm with the hand firmly gripping his sword helps to differentiate him from the ghost opposite. Both figures are well drawn in complicated poses; the rendering of Elpenor's head in three-quarter view — a problem which vase painters of this time still found difficult — is fairly successful.<note anchored="true" n="ii.88.2"><p>'In the photograph of Elpenor his cranium is distorted owing to the curvature of the vase.'</p></note> Hermes, in comparison with the other two, seems like a lay figure. Yet the attitude of his right hand and his intense gaze add somewhat to the pathos of the scene.'</p>

<p>The inscriptions are <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*L*P*E*N*O*R*O*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*D*U*S*E*U*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*R*M*O</foreign>.

<p>It is plain from Caskey's language that he would have preferred Hermes away. Perhaps there is more to say about this. Two things are expressed in the figure of Odysseus: pity, and self-control. That a third, surprise, should also be expressed in it is almost too much to expect. Yet surprise is one of the chief elements in the situation. It is expressed in the figure of Hermes. Again, the action of Hermes emphasizes the self-control of Odysseus. At the terrifying apparition, the god steps forward, ready to stand by the man: but the man has not flinched.</p>

<p>In a drawing of the scene that follows this in Homer, on an Etruscan mirror in the Vatican (Gerhard <title>E.S.</title> pl. 240; <title>JHS.</title> 69 pl. 5, b with p. 6), Hermes makes a third to Odysseus and the shade of Teiresias.</p>

<p>Caskey speaks of Hermes as conductor of the souls of the dead to the lower world: he might have added that when the living Herakles went down to Hades to fetch Cerberus, he was conducted by Hermes (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.626">Hom. Od. 11.626</bibl>), and the two are often seen together in this scene on vases; Orpheus also was escorted to the nether world by Hermes.</p>
<pb xml:id="ii.89" n="89"/>
<p>The story of the meeting of Odysseus and Elpenor in Hades may have been treated by Bacchylides: is not 'the man of Ithaca' in fr. 29 Elpenor rather than Odysseus?</p>

<p>This is the only picture of the subject. Elpenor was seen, close to Odysseus, in the Nekyia of Polygnotos at Delphi; Pausanias describes his costume, but not his attitude (<bibl n="Paus. 10.29.8">Paus. 10.29.8</bibl>): 'Above Eriphyle are depicted Elpenor and Odysseus. Odysseus is crouching and holding his sword over the trench. Behind Teiresias is Anticleia, mother of Odysseus, on a rock. Instead of a mantle, Elpenor has a mat round him, such as sailors commonly wear.' A very colourless figure of Elpenor appears, in a different scene, on another vase of about the same period as ours, the calyx-krater by the Nekyia Painter in New York (<title>Metr. St.</title> 5 pp. 125-7, Jacobsthal; <title>Anz.</title> 1935 pp. 25-30, Paul Friedländer; Richter and Hall pll. 135-7 and pl. 170, 135: <title>ARV.</title> p. 717, middle, no. 1). On an Etruscan mirror in New York (Richter <title>Greek, Roman and Etruscan Bronzes</title> p. 276, 800) and its two replicas <title>Velparun</title> takes the place of the Homeric Eurylochos when Odysseus threatens Circe.</p>

<p>On the reverse of the vase, a tame picture of Poseidon pursuing Amymone. The god has his trident in his right hand, and a cloak on his left shoulder and arm. Amymone, surprised at the fountain, holds a hydria in her left hand, and raises the other in alarm. She wears a peplos, open at the right side, with overfall, and round her head a broad band. A companion, dressed in chiton, himation, and saccos, flees, looking round. There is no relief-contour. Brown inner markings on the body of Poseidon; the hydria is covered with a light brown wash.</p>

<p>The pictures of Poseidon and Amymone have been studied recently by Greifenhagen (in <title>CV.</title> Bonn pp. 35-6) and Brommer (<title>A.M.</title> 63-4 pp. 171-6; and <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 71): but I arrange them rather differently, and can add something. The older essay by Jahn is still useful (<title>Poseidon und Amymone</title> in <title>Vasenbilder</title>, 1839, pp. 34-40).</p>

<p>According to the story usually told, Amymone, one of the fifty daughters of Danaos, went to draw water at the fountain, was assaulted by a satyr, and rescued by Poseidon, by whom she became the mother of Nauplios (not the Argonaut). There are many pictures on vases of Poseidon pursuing a maiden; the earliest, somewhat before 480 B.C., on a cup with the signature of the potter Brygos, and near the Castelgiorgio Painter, in Frankfort (<title>WV.</title> 8 pl. 2, whence Hoppin i p. 109; Schaal <title>Gr. Vasen aus Frankfurter Sammlungen</title> pl. 30, a, and pl. 31: <title>ARV.</title> p. 258). There, and often elsewhere, it is not possible to name the maiden, who is not characterized. On a somewhat later vase, a hydria of between 480 and 470 in the Vatican, by the Syleus Painter (Gerhard pl. 12, whence <title>El.</title> 3 pl. 5 and Overbeck <title>KM.</title> pl. 13, 2: phot. Alinari 35724: <title>ARV.</title> p. 167 no. 39), the maiden pursued by Poseidon is named: it is Aithra, daughter of Pittheus and mother of Theseus. She holds a kalathos, a wool-basket, which probably refers to some story unknown to us (the exact circumstances in which Poseidon met Aithra are not recorded). The wool-basket appears in another picture of Poseidon pursuing a maiden, a small hydria of about 470 B.C. in the British Museum, a late work of the Eucharides Painter (<rs key="London E 174" type="Vase">London E 174</rs>: <title>El.</title> 3 pl. 19; <title>CV.</title> pl. 78, 2 and pl. 79, 3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 155 no. 31), and makes it likely that Aithra is represented there too. A third possible representation is on a calyx-krater by the Kleophrades Painter in the Giudice collection, Agrigento, but the vase is so much restored that one cannot be sure (see <title>Kl.</title> p. 26, top: <title>ARV.</title> p. 124 no. 41).<note anchored="true" n="&amp;*;"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 89, eleven lines from the foot: the calyx-krater by the Kleophrades Painter has passed to the Basle market (M.M.) (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 186 no. 48): it is now cleaned, and the subjects are seen to be what I had thought.</p></note> On an unpublished lekythos, formerly in the Roman market, by the Dresden Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 449 no. 9), the woman pursued by Poseidon holds a hydria, and must be Amymone, who comes to fetch water. This is the earliest certain picture of Amymone, the date being between 480 and 460; and it heads a small group of pictures in which Poseidon pursues a woman who holds a hydria. The others are:</p>

The influence of a satyr-play is presumed: it may be, as Greifenhagen says (<title>CV.</title> Bonn p. 36) that the satyr, though part of the legend as known to us from ancient literature, did not occur in the original version, but was brought in by a dramatic poet.

<p>On an Etruscan mirror of the fourth century in the Vatican (Gerhard <title>Etruskische Spiegel</title> pl. 64) Poseidon suddenly appears at the fountain and seizes Amymone, while a young satyr looks on from behind a rock. The composition is not the same as in any of the known Greek representations, and recalls an earlier Greek work, the chalcedony scaraboid with Hades seizing Persephone (if that is the subject) in New York (Furtwängler <title>A.G.</title> pl. 9, 32; Richter <title>Metropolitan Museum: Catalogue of Engraved Gems</title> pl. 2).</p>

<p>An early fourth-century Attic hydria from Capua, by the Erbach Painter, formerly in the Bourguignon collection, now in the collection of William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon (<rs key="San Simeon 9835" type="Vase">San Simeon 9835</rs>), presents a difficult problem (<title>Coll. d'ant. 18 mars 1901</title> pl. 1, 41). Poseidon is seated in the middle, listening to Eros, and attended by several women and Erotes; below sits a woman with a hydria beside her — Amymone one would have thought at first glance; but Apollo is talking to her, and it cannot be Amymone, unless there was a version unknown to us. Papposilenos lies on the ground, occupied with his own thoughts. On an Attic calyx-krater of early Kerch style in Athens (<rs key="Athens 12252" type="Vase">Athens 12252</rs>: N. 1117), Poseidon appears in the company of two naked women, one of whom is seated on a laver; three satyrs and another woman complete the scene: it is not clear who the women are.</p>

<p>The picture on a pyxis in Athens has been supposed to represent Poseidon pursuing Amymone; and I regret to say that I named the Amymone Painter after it: I now realize that the maiden pursued by Poseidon is not Amymone, but a sea-nymph: Logothetiades, a hundred years ago, gave the subject of the Athens pyxis as Poseidon pursuing Amphitrite; but this interpretation was rejected by Heydemann when he published the vase (Heydemann seems to have thought that Amymone was a Nereid):</p>
<list type="simple">
<item><rs key="Athens 1708" type="Vase">Athens 1708</rs> (CC. 1551). Heydemann pl. 1, 2. By the Amymone Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 552 no. 31). Poseidon, with trident, pursues a woman who holds nothing in her hands; on the right, an altar, then a woman running up, and two others fleeing towards Triton. Triton, however, does not attend to them, but is engaged in an animated conversation with a female who is probably Aphrodite; expostulating perhaps. Between these two, a dolphin. Commentators on Homer have preserved the legend that Poseidon saw Amphitrite dancing in Naxos and carried her off (schol. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 3.91">Hom. Od. 3.91</bibl>; Eustathius on the same line: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n *Na/cw| th\n *)Amfitri/thn xoreu/ousan i)dw\n *Poseidw=n h(/rpasen</foreign>). She was naturally not dancing alone, but with the Nereids her sisters, and that is probably what has been happening on the pyxis, a dance at the altar or round it.<note anchored="true" n="ii.92.1"><p>Another story in Oppian <title>Halieut.</title> i, 383-93.</p></note> If the painter intended Amphitrite, he has indeed slipped: instead of Nereus he has introduced Triton. Triton was son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, so that his presence is an anachronism. The artist may have been influenced by pictures of Peleus and Thetis, where the Nereids are sometimes shown fleeing to both Nereus and Triton (cup by the Kleophrades Painter in London, <rs key="London E 73" type="Vase">London E 73</rs>, <title>J.

<p>The same subject appears on a later vase, a bell-krater of about 425 B.C. in Naples (<rs key="Naples 146720" type="Vase">Naples 146720</rs>: <title>NSc.</title> 1935 pl. 15, 1): Poseidon, with trident, pursues a maiden who is empty-handed; she flees towards an old man who holds a dolphin as well as a sceptre: Pesce (l.c. p. 260) names the old man Nereus and the maiden Amphitrite.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>There is an alternative, although I regard it as much less probable. If the pictures described on <ref target="ii.68" n="U">ii pp. 68-9</ref> represent Zeus pursuing Thetis, then the subject of the vases <pb xml:id="ii.93" n="93"/> in Athens and Naples may be Poseidon pursuing Thetis; and if so, the presence of Triton on the Athens vase is no longer an anachronism.</p>

<p>Bulle separated the Athens picture from those of Poseidon and Amymone (in Roscher s.v. Poseidon p. 2874), but doubted whether the maiden was Amphitrite rather than a nameless Nereid.</p>

<p>To return to the Boston vase. The conventional floral design at the handles is poorly done. Relief-lines are used for the contours of it, and the petals of the palmettes are ribbed. The handles are triple. The foot, the side of which is reserved, has a slight lip. Between base and foot, a fillet has been formed by a pair of tooled lines.<note anchored="true" n="*"><p>(From Addenda to Part II) P. 93.

<p>Height 0.212, diameter 0.1725. <title>Strena Helbigiana</title> p. 111 and pl. 3 (Hartwig), whence Jane Harrison <title>Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion</title> p. 449; Richter <title>A.R.V.S.</title> fig. 105; van Hoorn <title>Choes and Anthesteria</title> fig. 116; the shape, Caskey <title>G.</title> p. 139. Ridged handle. About 430 B.C., by the Kraipale Painter, so called after this vase (<title>ARV.</title> p. 738, above, no. 1).</p>

<p>The maenad Kraipale sits on a rock, her lips parted, her feet crossed, an upright thyrsus in her left hand, a kantharos held out in her right. The satyr Sikinnos faces her with an oinochoe in his right hand and a thyrsus in his left. Another maenad approaches her from behind, holding a vessel from which steam or smoke rises.</p>

<p>Kraipale wears a peplos, bracelets, earrings. Her hair is done in the fashion known as <foreign xml:lang="greek">lampa/dion</foreign> (see Robert <title>Die Masken der neueren attischen Komoedie</title> p. 43, and <title>CV.</title> Oxford p. 37).</p>

<p>A white chaplet of the same sort as those in no. 113 (below, <ref target="ii.95" n="U">ii p. 95</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8085" type="Vase">Boston 01.8085</rs>) surrounds the head, running from the forehead to behind the bun: it is not visible in the photograph, nor is it shown in Frank Gearing's drawing published by Hartwig. The exact wear of the peplos is not easy to make out, but it seems to have a long overfall, overgirt. Hartwig says that one of the shoulder-pins can be seen, but this is not so. The garment of the other maenad is a chiton, but without the usual 'false sleeves'. It has a flounce at the neck (equivalent to the overfall of the peplos), is girt at the waist, and the material pulled down over the girdle. Earrings, frontlet, and a chaplet like Kraipale's. The satyr wears an ivy-wreath, and again a chaplet, not shown in the photograph or the drawing. His oinochoe, which is slightly foreshortened, is not a chous, but of shape I. A brown line runs round the shoulder of this oinochoe.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The nude parts of all three figures have relief-contour. The minor markings of the satyr's body are in brown lines. The stripe near the foot of the second maenad's chiton is also brown. An uneven light brown is perhaps used on the oinochoe and the kantharos (which are thought of as metal): in any case the inside of the kantharos is brown, and the upper side of the foot-plate except the edge. The rock, and the steam or smoke rising from the vessel, are in white lines which have faded and do not come out in the photograph: for these <pb xml:id="ii.94" n="94"/> particulars and others, Gearing's drawing must still be consulted. The inscriptions are in white. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*R*A*I*P*A*L*H</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*I*K*I*N*N*O*S</foreign> are clear. The third name is fragmentary and has been variously read. Sikinnos as a satyr-name occurs on three other vases, and Sikinnis is also found (Charlotte Fränkel <title>Satyr- und Bakchennamen auf Vasenbildern</title> p. 69; Leonard in Pauly-Wissowa s.v. Sikinos; <title>AJA.</title> 1939 p. 620). The names are taken from the <emph>sikinnis</emph>, the characteristic dance of the satyr-play. Kraipale does not appear elsewhere as a maenad's name, but Lambertz noted that a Roman slave-woman was called Crepale (see Fränkel op. cit. p. 61). Methe is a natural name for a maenad, a companion of Dionysos, but Kraipale may strike one as excessive. The word means <emph>crapula</emph>, the after-effects of deep drinking — sick headache and the rest. It was sometimes used as a coarser equivalent for 'intoxication', but <emph>crapula</emph> was the original and proper meaning, which it never lost. It is a nice question whether this or line 277 of the <title>Acharnians</title> is our earliest evidence for the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">kraipa/lh</foreign>. We date the vase '<emph>about</emph> 430'. It <emph>might</emph> be as late as 425, and the <title>Acharnians</title> was produced in 425. The matter is not of moment, as there is no reason to suppose that the word was new in the third quarter of the fifth century.<note anchored="true" n="ii.94.1"><p>A vase of the Hellenistic period, a kantharos of West Slope ware from Corinth (<title>Hesp</title>. 16 p. 240), bears the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A*U*S*I*K*R*H*P*A[*L*O*U]</foreign>, is sacred, therefore, to a hitherto unknown attendant of Dionysos, Pausikraipalos.</p></note><note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 94: Andrew Gow points out to me that Hippocrates <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Peri\ a)e/rwn</foreign> 3 may conceivably be earlier than the <title>Acharnians</title> or our vase.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>What is happening in the picture? According to Hartwig (<title>Strena Helbigiana</title> pp. 111-14), Kraipale holds out her kantharos for more wine, but the satyr hesitates to supply her, and the maenad brings a hot soothing potion instead. Hartwig had no difficulty in showing that such restoratives were known to the Greeks: and a passage in the <title>Acharnians</title> is in point (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 276">Aristoph. Ach. 276</bibl>):</p> 
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>*Falh=s *Falh=s,</l>

<l>e(/wqen ei)rh/nhs r(ofh/sei tru/blion.</l></quote>
<p>This explanation suits a certain languor in the figure of Kraipale, contrasting with the seriousness of the other two; and has been adopted by Miss Harrison (<title>Prolegomena</title> p. 450), by myself (in <title>VA.</title> p. 177), by Deubner (<title>Attische Feste</title> p. 247), and recently by Immerwahr (<title>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</title> 77 pp. 251-4). Deubner connected the scene with the festival of the Anthesteria: the artist has in mind the very end of the festivities that took place on the second day, the Choes: a common and homely episode in ordinary life is raised to a higher sphere, the revels of satyrs and maenads. Immerwahr has argued persuasively for this view. A difficulty is the shape of the vessel held by the second maenad. The vessels that most resemble it, of those known to us, seem to be thuribles, and if it is a thurible it should contain incense, not a tisane. On a pelike by the Alkimachos Painter in Dresden (<rs key="Dresden ZV. 2535" type="Vase">Dresden ZV. 2535</rs>: <title>ARV.</title> p. 357 no. 25) Nike carries a torch in one hand and a vessel very like this in the other: it is doubtless one of those thuribles that she often holds. Hartwig thought of a thurible, but decided that a drinking-vessel was more likely. Wigand suggested a thurible, though with hesitation (<title>Bonner Jahrbücher</title> 122 p. 49 note 3). Miss Fränkel (op. cit. pp. 60-1) and Eitrem (<title>Opferritus und Voropfer</title> pp. 227-8) pronounced for a thurible. See the thuribles, of clay and bronze, collected by Wigand (op. cit. pp. 1-97) and Kourouniotis (in <title>Classical Studies presented to Edward Capps</title> pp. 204-16); see also <title>BCH.</title> 1946 p. 100 (J. M. Cook). A silver vessel very like ours was found at Kerch (<title>A.B.C.</title> pl. 38, 4, with S. Reinach's commentary, p. 70).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>If the contents of the vessel are not intended for Kraipale, one might think of the fumigation of the room after a party. Miss Fränkel was reminded of the use of incense before and during the symposion: for this, one need only quote Xenophanes (fr. I, 7 Diehl) and as an illustration the symposion on a fourth-century bell-krater in Naples (FR. pl. 173).</p>

<p>My wife points out that Hartwig's interpretation might be saved by supposing the vessel to contain not a potion, but smouldering herbs the fumes from which might act as a restorative.</p>

<p>The name of the second maenad remains to be discussed. Hartwig read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*U*M*H</foreign>, <pb xml:id="ii.95" n="95"/> and expanded it to <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*E*U]*Q*U*M(*I)*H</foreign>, which is not Attic. Wünsch conjectured <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*U*M*H[*D*I*A]</foreign> (<title>BPW.</title> 1900 p. 912), Edward Robinson read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*F*U*M*N[*I*A]</foreign> (Report 1900 p. 61), Eitrem took <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*U*M*H</foreign> to be a complete proper name (referring to incense) and quoted the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Qumos</foreign> of that desperate epigram on the Ladas of Myron. Immerwahr (op. cit. p. 252) has reexamined the vase, reads <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*U*M*H...</foreign>, and accepts Wünsch's <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Qumhdi/a</foreign>.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Parts I and II) P. 95: for the name Thymedia see also <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1685.</p></note></p>

<p>Dietrich von Bothmer reads <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H</foreign> rather than <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N</foreign>, and when I last looked at the inscription I decided for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H</foreign>. The first letter, very carelessly written, is either theta or phi. There is no trace of a letter before it. Wünsch's suggestion is probably the best.</p>

<p>Miss Fränkel, accepting <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*F*U*M*N[*I*A]</foreign>, detected a reference to the paean sung at the symposion. The 'refrain' was not of course confined to the paean, although it was an indispensable part of it. If Ephymnia is the name, one thinks more naturally of the Dionysiac <foreign xml:lang="greek">eu)oi=</foreign>, than of <foreign xml:lang="greek">i)h/ie paia/n</foreign>.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The vase was in Edward Warren's collection when published by Hartwig in 1900. It was acquired in Italy: Hartwig said that the finding-place could not be established, and in <title>ARV.</title> I gave no provenience: but this is evidently the vase described, though without mention of the inscriptions, in <title>Bullettino</title> 1881 p. 242, and said to have been found about forty-eight metres from the tombs north of Cucumella at Vulci. Worth noticing that an oinochoe of the same shape and size, <rs key="Louvre G 402" type="Vase">Louvre G 402</rs> (<title>BCH.</title> 1895 p. 100; van Hoorn <title>Choes</title> fig. 500), which I have described as connected with the Kraipale vase and perhaps by the same hand (<title>ARV.</title> p. 738), was also found at Vulci, at Cucumella, though long before, in 1829. Much of the finest drawing from the period of the Peloponnesian War is on vases of this shape, choes; the provenience, when known, is usually Attica: but many reached Italy and Etruria.</p>

<p>I have hardly any doubt now that the Louvre chous, and the pair in Copenhagen said in <title>ARV.</title> p. 738 to 'recall' the artist, are by the Kraipale Painter himself.</p>

<p>Height 0.216; diameter 0.181. The handle is modern. <title>VA.</title> p. 178 fig. 110 (from a drawing by Frank Gearing), whence Pfuhl fig. 565, <title>Städel-Jahrbuch</title> 2 pl. 7, d (Schaal), and (redrawn) Dugas <title>La céramique grecque</title> p. 120; van Hoorn <title>Choes and Anthesteria</title> fig. 501. Satyrs attacking a sleeping maenad. About 420 B.C.</p>

<p>The maenad has placed a cushion on the hill-side, laid her garment under her with the end between her knees, and fallen asleep, still holding her thyrsus. Two satyrs steal up, but one of them seems at the last moment to lose heart: so on a later vase with the same subject, a fourth-century Attic pelike in London (<rs key="London 1901.7-10.5" type="Vase">London 1901.7-10.5</rs>: below, <ref target="ii.97" n="U">ii p. 97</ref>), while two satyrs, encouraged by Eros, lay hands on the sleeper, their two companions turn away in alarm. One cannot help thinking of small birds hopping up to fetch crumbs. Satyrs are both forward and timorous, and the alternation must have been a popular motive in satyric drama.</p>

<p>The terrain, with plants, is indicated by incised lines. The figures are contoured with relief-lines. Some of the inner markings on the bodies are in brown. The hair is brown. The bracelet of the maenad is a relief-line. The left-hand satyr wears an ivy-wreath, and over it a head-fillet which was originally gilt. (The two lines forming a triangle with it in the illustration represent fractures only.) The other satyr also wears a fillet, which is damaged but may have been of the same nature.</p>

<p>The border above the picture is a band of cyma surmounted by a narrower strip of simple egg-pattern. This double pattern occurs in the same place on other full-sized choes, by various painters, between 430 and 410: <rs key="Tbingen E 120" type="Vase">Tübingen E 120</rs> (Watzinger pl. 32); <rs key="RISD 25.090" type="Vase">RISD 25.090</rs> (<title>CV.</title> pl. 23, 2: the cyma here above); Athens, Vlasto collection, by the Eretria Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 725 no. 10; van Hoorn <title>Choes</title> fig. 38); <rs key="Athens 1736" type="Vase">Athens 1736</rs> (CC. 1307), imitation of the Eretria Painter (<title>ARV.</title> 731, middle); Athens, Agora, <rs key="Athens, Agora P 15034" type="Vase">Athens, Agora P 15034</rs>, manner of the Meidias Painter (<title>ARV.</title> p. 837 no. 29 bis: van Hoorn <title>Choes</title> fig. 183); Vatican (<title>Mus.

<p>I do not know of any other vases by the same hand. In <title>ARV.</title> (p. 794) I spoke of the <pb xml:id="ii.96" n="96"/> drawing as influenced by the Dinos Painter, but the influence is not strong. There is some resemblance to the Meidias Painter also: for instance, the fine, mannered late-fifth-century hands are more like Meidian. The vase that comes nearest to ours is perhaps a chous in New York (<rs key="New York 37.11.21" type="Vase">New York 37.11.21</rs>: <title>Bull. Metr. Mus.</title> 34 p. 239; van Hoorn <title>Choes</title> fig. 173: komos).</p>

<p>There are a good many vases with this subject, strung out between the third quarter of the sixth century and the second quarter of the fourth. A list follows. The archaic are the best, and among these the cups by the Panaitios Painter excel. The Boston vase is one of three fine choes, painted between 430 and 420 B.C.

<p>An Attic bell-krater of the advanced fourth century in the collection of Mr. Francesco Fienga at Nocera de' Pagani is known to me from photographs kindly given me by Prof. Karl Lehmann. A naked maenad sits to left, looking round, her left elbow resting on her tympanon; the flesh is white. Four satyrs steal up and the nearest embraces her. Her eyes seem to be open, but it should be said that this figure is much repainted, and one cannot be quite sure from the photograph. On the reverse, three youths. An unusual feature is that the satyrs all wear white woollen countryman's hats of the kind described on <ref target="ii.48" n="U">ii p. 48</ref>. The same hat is worn by a satyr on a small bell-krater fragment, of much the same style as the Fienga vase, in Athens, from the Pnyx, <rs key="Athens P 224" type="Vase">Athens P 224</rs>; and by satyrs vintaging on earlier vases, such as the column-krater by the Orchard Painter in Bologna (<rs key="Bologna 241" type="Vase">Bologna 241</rs>: <title>Mus. It.</title> 2 pl. 1, 3; <title>CV.</title> pl. 28, 1-3: <title>ARV.</title> p. 347 no. 20).</p>

<p>In another Attic vase of the fourth century the intruders are not satyrs, but Pans:</p>
<list type="simple"><item>Leningrad (St. 2161), rf. pelike. No. 412 in Schefold's list (in <title>U</title>. p. 46). I have no note. Stephani's description of the maenad recalls the bell-krater <rs key="Athens 1397" type="Vase">Athens 1397</rs>. The two Pans move away from the sleeper, looking back towards her, which reminds one of the scared satyr on the London pelike. Pan is also the attacker in a small clay mould, for making circular reliefs, found at Cherchel (<title>Rev. arch.</title> 19 (1892), i, pl. 11, whence Herbig <title>Pan</title> pl. 40, 1): he assaults a sleeping maenad but a satyr hauls him back by leg and tail.</item></list>
<p>In another representation the attacker is again a satyr, but the attacked is a boy, not a girl. The cut-out relief of a Locrian bronze mirror, in free fifth-century style, in Reggio, shows a long-haired boy sitting on a rock, and an elderly satyr who has stolen up to him taking him by the wrist with his right hand and raising his left arm, near the boy's head, with a gesture of admiration (<title>Boll. d'Arte</title> 1950 pp. 193-5). Iacopi, who publishes the mirror, aptly compares the figures on the Tragodia oinochoe in Oxford, no. 20 in our list. He is inclined to call the boy Dionysos, which does not appear to me likely: more probably the artist has varied a model which figured satyr and nymph by changing the girl into a boy to whom it would be rash to give a name. The boy's eyes are not closed, but the attitude expresses incomplete consciousness, as of one sleeping who has just opened his eyes and does not yet know where he is, much less what is taking place.</p>

<p><title>Bacchae obreptantibus satyris</title> [<foreign xml:lang="greek">*Ba/kxais e)fe/rpontes *Sa/turoi</foreign>] was the subject of a famous painting by the fourth-century artist Nicomachos: Pliny does not state that the maenads were sleeping, but they may have been. On later representations of the subject, in painting and sculpture, see Helbig <title>Untersuchungen über die campanische Wandmalerei</title> pp. 238-9 and 251-2, and Winter <title>Altertümer von Pergamon vii</title> pp. 323-5.</p>

<p>According to Hyginus (<title>Fab.</title> clxix A) Amymone was asleep when she was attacked by the satyr: 'Amymone Danai filia missa est a patre aquam petitum ad sacrum faciendum, quae dum quaerit lassitudine obdormiuit; quam satyrus uiolare uoluit.'</p>

<p>When speaking of the Boston oinochoe in <title>VA.</title> p. 180, I referred to Titian's <title>Jupiter and Antiope</title>. I wonder now if that is really the subject of the picture in the Louvre? Titian himself, in 1574, described it as 'la nuda con il paese con el satiro'. He was very old, of course, and may have forgotten the subject: but what evidence is there that the satyr is Jupiter disguised, rather than a real satyr? The picture was long known not as Antiope but as the 'Venus del Pardo', from the Palazzo Pardo in Madrid, where it <pb xml:id="ii.99" n="99"/> remained till 1624.<note anchored="true" n="ii.99.1"><p>It was painted for King Philip II of Spain, and was given by King Philip IV to King Charles I of England. After the death of Charles Stuart it passed to the banker Jabach, and was acquired by Cardinal Mazarin. It was in the Prado before reaching the Louvre. Cardinal Mazarin also possessed the 'Jupiter and Antiope' by Correggio. Does this represent Jupiter and Antiope?</p></note> According to Claude Phillips (<title>The Later Work of Titian</title> p. 92) 'the group of Antiope with Jupiter in the guise of a Satyr is clearly a reminiscence of a <title>Nymph surprised by a Satyr</title> — one of the engravings in the <title>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</title> first published in 1499 but republished with the same illustrations in 1545'. There is not much resemblance between the cut in the <title>Hypnerotomachia</title> and the picture by Titian, but it is likely enough that the subject is the same in both. The presence of Cupid is surely not sufficient to prove that the attacker is a god and not a satyr; and the skin on which the sleeper lies suggests that she is a maenad or a nymph.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Another picture by Titian with the same sort of subject as the Louvre 'Antiope' was mentioned by Lomazzo in 1590: 'a picture of Venus asleep, with Satyrs uncovering her, and other Satyrs about her eating grapes, while Adonis in the distance is seen hunting. This piece he describes as having been left by Titian at his death to his son Pomponio. There is an adaptation of the composition on canvas ascribed to Titian in the Corsini Palace at Rome, but it is not original' (Crowe and Cavalcaselle <title>The Life and Times of Titian</title> ii p. 319).</p>

I now judge all seven vases to be late work of the Euaion Painter.</item>

<head>ADDENDA TO PART II</head>
<p>The commentary was complete by the end of 1949, but publication has been delayed. I have been able to work some additional matter into the text, but not all that I should have wished.</p>
<list type="simple">
<item>Pp. 1-2. Important additions to the list of vases by Euphronios have now been made by Villard in <title>Mon. Piot</title> 45 pp. 1-13. Add a neck-amphora in the Louvre with an acontist on one side, a discus-thrower on the other, the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*N*T*I*A*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign> and the fragmentary signature ... <foreign xml:lang="greek">*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>.</item>
<item>P. 12. Danae. I take the opportunity of saying that I have always taken the bell-krater <rs key="Athens N. 1134" type="Vase">Athens N. 1134</rs> (<title>AM.</title> 65 pl. 23, 1), with Lullies, to be Boeotian, and not Attic as I am made to say in Metzger <title>Les représentations dans la céramique attique du ive siècle</title> p. 336 — through a confusion, perhaps of numbers, for which I may be responsible.</item>
<item>P. 34. Delete the cup added as no. 20 bis: it is by the Antiphon Painter.</item>
<item>P. 51, no. 95. A (after <title>Panm.</title>), Sichtermann <title>Ganymed</title> fig. 2; the New York oinochoe (after <title>Panm.</title>), ibid. fig. 3; Nolan amphora by the Providence Painter, <rs key="Vienna 652" type="Vase">Vienna 652</rs>, ibid. fig. 4.</item>
<item>Pp. 55-61. On this subject see now Rumpf in <title>Studies Robinson</title> ii pp. 84-9.</item>
<item>Pp. 61-3. On such subjects see now Rumpf in <title>Jb.</title> 65-6 pp. 165-74, Metzger <title>Les représentations</title> pp. 72-89, Boulter in <title>Hesp.</title> 22 pp. 67-9.</item>
<item>P. 67, ten lines from the foot. After 'our four' add: 'Shefton has noted a small fragment of an eighth such cup in Barcelona, from Ampurias.'</item>
<item>P. 70, no. 106. The obverse is now published, from Miss Chapman's drawing, by Vian <title>Répertoire des gigantomachies figurées</title> pl. 41, 382. See also Vian <title>La guerre des géants</title> pp. 85-90.</item>
<item>P. 73, note 3. The Louvre fragment by the Kleophrades Painter, which I once thought might represent Orpheus, is part of a stamnos with Gigantomachy.</item>
<item>P. 84, line 21. See, however, Winter <title>Die Typen der figürlichen Terrakotten</title> i p. 213, 6.</item>
<item>P. 84, note 1. Another explanation of the Naples cup is given by Latte in <title>Festschrift zur Feier des zweihundertjährigen Bestehen der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen</title> ii pp. 67-74.
Tereus pursues Procne and Philomele (who have small birds on their heads) on the early classic column-krater which contains the ashes of Luigi Pirandello <pb xml:id="ii.103" n="103"/> at Agrigento. I owe photographs to the kindness of Mrs. Paola Zancani Montuoro; the birds are not visible in the small photograph published by Griffo, <title>Il Museo Civico di Agrigento</title> p. 29, 1.</item>
<item>P. 86, middle. The bronze plaque is in Munich (<title>Münchener Jahrbuch</title> 1950 p. 245, Lullies).</item>
<item>P. 93. In two neck-amphorae from the workshop of Polygnotos the <emph>floral decoration</emph> is by the same hand as in no. 111: <rs key="Berlin 2353" type="Vase">Berlin 2353</rs>, by Polygnotos (Jacobsthal <title>O.</title> pl. 112: <title>ARV.</title> p. 680 no. 35), and, as Dr. Alexandros Cambitoglou pointed out to me, that by the Kleophon Painter in the Haniel collection, Munich (Neugebauer <title>ADP.</title> pl. 77: <title>ARV.</title> p. 786 no. 36).</item>
<item>P. 97. No. 23 is now published in Dugas <title>Délos xxi</title> pl. 54, 5, no. 24 in <title>CV.</title> Vienna pl. 26, 1-4, no. 27 in Metzger <title>Les représentations dans la céramique attique du ive siècle</title> pl. 10. The attribution to the Herakles Painter is Schefold's (in <title>U</title>. p. 158).</item></list></div></div>

Norton had already associated the vase with 'Andokides'.</p>

<p>Our plate 66 shows the pictures without the extensive restorations. Part of the mouth of the vase is also modern, but the form of it is assured.</p>

<p>I begin by quoting some paragraphs from <title>Attic Black-figure Vase-painters</title> (p. 254):</p>
<quote><p>'In <title>ABS</title>. pp. 25 and 38-41 I put together a number of black-figured vases and called the painter (after a kalos-name on one of them) the Lysippides Painter. Among his works are the <emph>black-figure</emph> pictures on six <emph>bilingual</emph> amphorae — amphorae in which one picture is black-figure, while the other is red-figure — and the <emph>black-figure</emph> part of a bilingual cup. And the <emph>red-figure</emph> portions of those seven vases? They in their turn are by one artist. Is that artist the Lysippides Painter? In <title>ABS</title>. I said that he might well be, but I would not decide. Later (in <title>ARV</title>. and elsewhere) I made up my mind that he was: I have now come to the conclusion that he is not.
</p>
<p>'The bilingual cup in Palermo (<title>CV</title>. pll. 1-2) is one of the vases that bear the <emph>potter</emph>-signature of Andokides. Among the other works of the man who painted the red-figure part of it are three amphorae — two of them red-figure, the third 'white-figure' — with the same signature. Hence I gave him the conventional name of 'Andokides Painter'. He also painted the <emph>red-figure</emph> parts of the six <emph>bilingual</emph> amphorae mentioned above. So then: instead of attributing these six amphorae (as I did in <title>ARV.1</title>) to the Andokides Painter, I now say that A — the red-figure part — is by the Andokides Painter, and B — the black-figure part — by the Lysippides Painter, reviving the name.'</p></quote>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The Boston amphora is of Type A. The shapes of nine amphorae fashioned by Andokides have been analysed by Bloesch (<title>JHS</title>. 71 pp. 29-31). He does not deal with the two amphorae in Boston, our nos. 114 and 115: they do not greatly differ in shape from the nine, and should be by the same potter as they. A few words about one small particular: in both Boston vases the profile of the foot-disk — the upper member of the foot — is black; and so it is in the majority of the Andokides Painter's amphorae (nos. 1, 5-8, and 10 of my list in <title>ARV.1</title>, also in two new amphorae (see p. 6); in nos. 2, 9, 11 it is reserved (in nos. 3 and 4 the foot is missing). In the early amphorae of Type A it is usually black; in those of the generation after the Andokides Painter it is usually reserved — in the Leagros Group nearly always, and in red-figure contemporary with the Leagros Group. Reserving calls attention to the member: the artist desires strong punctuation at that place on the vase.</p>

<p>We cannot say how Andokides would have described this shape of vase if he wished to distinguish it from other roughly similar shapes, but we can be sure of one word that might be applied to it: for on an Attic black-figured amphora of Type A in the Lucerne market, from the same period as ours,<note anchored="true" n="iii.1.1"><p><title>Ars Antiqua Auktion IV</title> pl. 44, 131.</p></note> with a representation of Athena in a wheeling chariot, one of the inscriptions, which are not graffiti but painted in the field of the picture itself, is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S*H*O*K*A*D*O*S</foreign>. No doubt the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">ka/dos</foreign> had a wider significance, but to use it of an amphora type A would not have been wrong. See Amyx: in <title>Hesperia</title> 27 pp. 186-90.</p>

<p>At least four or five painters collaborated with the potter Andokides. Three of them were named in <title>ARV.1</title> (p. 1): (1) the Andokides Painter; (2) Psiax; (3) Epiktetos. The Lysippides Painter (4) must now be added; and (5) the artist who decorated the earliest vase with the signature, the small chariot-amphora formerly in the Fitzwilliam collection and now in that of Mr. Christos Bastis, Bronxville.<note anchored="true" n="iii.1.2"><p>A, <title>Cat.

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The subject of both pictures is one of those that are not recorded, or are barely alluded to, in extant literature and are known to us from works of art only, in this case chiefly vases, but also archaic bronze reliefs, fragments of an archaic marble group, an Etruscan scarab, and Etruscan mirrors. The earliest and finest of the representations is on the amphora by Exekias in the Vatican.<note anchored="true" n="iii.2.1"><p><rs key="Vatican 344" type="Vase">Vatican 344</rs>; FR. pll. 131-2 and iii pp. 65 and 71-73; Pfuhl figs. 229-30; Albizzati pll. 40-42 and pp. 127-33; Technau <title>Exekias</title> pll. 20-21: <title>ABV.</title> p. 145 no. 13.</p></note> The subject is a great favourite on later black-figure vases; there are not many red-figure examples, but three of them give a more circumstantial version than any of the black-figure. The ingenious hero Palamedes (this we do know from the poets) invented various games to while away the long hours at Aulis; one day at Troy the two chief champions of the Greeks, Achilles and Ajax, on duty outside the gate, became so absorbed in their board-game that before they looked up the Trojans were upon them. Blinkenberg saw that the story must have been told in a lost epic, and Robert suggested that this may have been the <title>Palamedeia</title>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.2.2"><p>On the subject: Blinkenberg in <title>AM.</title> 23 p. 11; Robert <title>Nekyia</title> p. 57; Hauser in FR iii pp. 66-67; Lippold in <title>Münchener archäologische Studien</title> pp. 426-8; Robert <title>Heldensage</title> p. 1127; Schweitzer in <title>Jb.</title> 44 pp. 116-17; Schefold in <title>Jb.</title> 52 pp. 30-33 and 68-71; Chase in <title>Bull.

Hauser's statement (FR. ii p. 66, foot) that bloodshed took place before the heroes were aroused is based on the alien fragment. The cup has now been cleaned and the alien fragment removed.</item>
<item>(4) <rs key="London E 10" type="Vase">London E 10</rs>, by the Euergides Painter (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 61 no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 90 no. 33). Gerhard <title>A.V.</title> pl. 186. This cup is contemporary with nos. 1 and 2, and earlier than no. 3, but we have left it to the last because the arrangement of the figures is peculiar, and the picture requires some explanation. The two heroes sit at a gaming-table which the artist has placed under one of the handles. Gerhard's drawing is misleading, as it suppresses the table and substitutes for it a representation of the city-gate of Troy which is really under the other handle of the cup. There is an earlier example of this arrangement of table and players on a black-figured cup in Copenhagen (Greifenhagen <title>Griechische Eroten</title> pp. 47-49): under each handle, a gaming-table and to each side of it a winged youth, seated, a caduceus in his hand. Returning to the Euergides Painter: the shields of the heroes lean against trees behind them. On one half of the cup, a party of Trojans move up to the attack. Three of them are shown, all fully armed, two on foot and one on horseback. One of them, probably the foremost, is inscribed <foreign xml:lang="greek">*T*E*L*E*F*O*S</foreign>. Behind them (under the handle as was said) is the gate of Troy, through which they have passed. On the other half of the cup three more persons advance in the direction of the two heroes. The leader is a naked youth who extends his left arm and holds a spear in his right hand. He is followed by a naked youth on horseback and a warrior, fully armed, on foot. The upper part of the warrior is missing, except the right arm minus the hand. In Gerhard's drawing he is restored as adjusting his helmet, and this may be correct: as his spear is in his left hand the right hand must be occupied, either adjusting the helmet, or beckoning to people behind him. Now these three persons might be Trojans (composition as in the frieze of the Parthenon), but they are surely more likely to be Greeks. The youth in front, whether a scout or not, has been the first to notice the approach of the enemy, and he rushes to warn the two heroes; another youth leaps on to a horse, and an armed man follows.</item></list></p>
<p>The artist has given the foremost youth the not altogether appropriate name of Telephos. He may have picked a heroic name at random; but he may also have been thinking of 'a local lad, in with the Greeks' — which Telephos too was, in a way.</p></note></p>

<p>The game is <term xml:lang="greek">pessoi/</term>, and doubtless the form of it known as <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/nte grammai/</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)pi\ pe/nte grammai=s</foreign>, akin to backgammon in that it combined skill with chance.

<p>The black-figure picture on the Boston vase is like a weak version of Exekias' picture. The two heroes sit at the gaming-table and one of them is making his move. But before <pb xml:id="iii.3" n="3"/>proceeding we ought to decide which is Achilles and which is Ajax.

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The two heroes sit on simple block-seats at a gaming-table which is also a rectangular block, but is topped by a slab (with a torus moulding) forming a board. Eleven 'pieces' or 'pess-men' are ranged on the board at almost equal intervals, and Achilles takes hold of the third piece. The number of pieces represented in the pictures varies: here one cannot help thinking of the five lines, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/nte grammai/</foreign>, on each half of the board, and the 'sacred line', <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(era\ grammh/</foreign>, between them.</p>

<p>The table and what is on it are shown in profile. If we wish to know what it would look like when seen from above, we may turn, first, to the later of the two Etruscan mirrors with the subject; secondly, to a small clay model of a gaming-table in Copenhagen, Attic from the second quarter of the sixth century;<note anchored="true" n="iii.3.5"><p>Ussing <title>Nye Erhvervelser</title> pl. 1; a simplified sketch, <title>AM.</title> 23 p. 8.</p></note> thirdly, to actual stone gaming-tables found at Epidauros, at Corinth, and in Delos.

<p>The senses of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pessoi/</foreign> that interest us at the moment are nos. 3 and 4, which since the game was regularly played out-of-doors tend to pass into one another.

<p>The same simple object — a rectangular block with flat oblong top — , whether natural and fixed, or rectangular and portable, might serve either as gaming-table or as voting-table; and in pictures of the voting on the disposal of Achilles' armour, for instance in the cup by Douris in Vienna,<note anchored="true" n="iii.4.3"><p><rs key="Vienna 3695" type="Vase">Vienna 3695</rs>: FR. pl. 54; <title>CV.</title> pl. 12.</p></note> the table on which the <foreign xml:lang="greek">yh=foi</foreign> are cast has the same form as the table on which, in our Boston picture and others, the game of <foreign xml:lang="greek">pessoi/</foreign> is played.</p>

<p>To return to our Boston vase. Ajax has his right hand near the board, ready to play when his turn comes. Both heroes wear chitoniskoi, and are armed, with corslet, cushes, greaves; as in Exekias, they wear short cloaks over their armour, and each holds a pair of spears in his left hand. Behind them, their shields lean against something, with their helmets perched on top; behind them, or beside them at arm's reach. Both sit with the hither leg drawn back; Ajax is farther from the table than Achilles, although he sits farther forward on his <foreign xml:lang="greek">qa=kos</foreign>: perhaps he is the more excited of the two. Much of Achilles' shield, which is seen in profile, is missing, and one cannot be sure whether it was round — an Argive shield — or as is more likely, of 'Boeotian' type like Ajax's. The device is a pair of panthers, done in white, now faded, with some incised detail: there was probably another charge between them in the missing part. The shield of Ajax is seen in full front view: it is the famous shield, and the artist makes more of it. The device is a rosette between two lions. The rosette is in incised lines, with a white dot at the heart and a red dot on each petal. The lions — regardant, the forepart down, the hindquarters up, one foreleg raised — are in white (again faded), with details very lightly incised. The scollops are bordered with a nebuly pattern, a favourite of the artist's. The rims of both shields are red.</p>
<pb xml:id="iii.5" n="5"/>
<p>The helmets are of Corinthian type. Achilles' helmet is well preserved. An incised line marks the eyebrow. A thin fillet, in red, is passed round the helmet, coronal-wise. The crest sits on a tall standard, and is edged with red. The helmet of Ajax was similar, but all that remains is part of the cheekpiece and of the crest.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Achilles' chitoniskos is of thick material, with a pattern of lozenges, each charged with a circle: so too in the corresponding figure on the painter's neck-amphora in London.<note anchored="true" n="iii.5.1"><p><rs key="London B 211" type="Vase">London B 211</rs>. See above, <ref target="iii.3" n="U">iii p. 3</ref> note 4 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>).</p></note> The lower border is nebuly, between two thin strips of white dots. Ajax's chitoniskos is of thinner stuff, has a crinkled edge, and is divided by crinkled lines into areas black and red: a summary indication of radiating folds.</p>

<p>The corslets are unusual. They seem to be of bronze and not of leather as in the Exekias vase. Compare the corslet of the young warrior on the stamnos by the Berlin Painter in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2406" type="Vase">Munich 2406</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.5.2"><p>FR. pl. 106, 2; Lullies and Hirmer pll. 62-63: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 138 no. 106; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 207 no. 137.</p></note> The corslet of Achilles has a pair of spirals, edged with red, on the chest. Ajax has a row of leather flaps, <foreign xml:lang="greek">pte/ruges</foreign>, sewn to the lining of his. Above the waist in both is what looks like a sash: in Achilles, nebuly; in Ajax, decorated with curls.</p>

<p>The cloaks are of the same sort as in Exekias, but the pattern-work is poorer. The border is nebuly, and nebuly bands divide the rest into triangular compartments, each charged with a star or trefoil: white heart and petals, red interdots. Most of the thin stripes edging the nebuly bands are studded with white dots.</p>

<p>The greaves have a red border; the cushes are conventionally rendered, by spirals like those on the corslet.</p>

<p>Achilles has no sword; the sword of Ajax is worn very short under his left arm. The hilt is white. At waist-level the cloak by error is made to fall on the hither side of the sword.</p>

<p>The figures are lined with incision almost throughout, and so is the shield of Ajax. Both incision and red are used in the standard double-floral band above the picture.</p>

<p>The treatment of the subject on the London amphora B 193<note anchored="true" n="iii.5.3"><p><rs key="London B 193" type="Vase">London B 193</rs>: <title>CV.</title> pl. 1; A, cleaned, <title>Jb.</title> 76. p. 55; cleaned, Suppl. Plate 17.</p></note> is very similar. Not quite so close, the painter's third version, on the neck-amphora <rs key="London B 211" type="Vase">London B 211</rs>.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The layout of the red-figure picture is the same, but more symmetrical. The chief differences in detail are in the position of hands and spears; the helmets, too, are on the heads, and both shields are in profile; and the artist is more interested in his work.</p>

<p>The gaming-table is more elaborate than in the black-figure picture: the top is neatly finished off with volutes and oculi, and bounded below by a band of egg-pattern between two thin dot-bands. There are eight game-pieces, shown as red dots. The seats are red, with a thick reserved border.</p>

<p>Achilles is about to make his move, but does not touch the piece. With two fingers and the end of his thumb he holds a small thin thing, done in red — a shaving, perhaps, or a splinter. Presumably he will propel the piece with this instead of lifting or pushing it with his fingers. This does not occur in any other picture of the subject and is not easily explained: precaution against cheating by moving two pieces at once? or what?</p>

<p>The right hand of Ajax is also unusual: he extends two long fingers and the thumb: that is, he indicates what he has scored with the dice. In Exekias, Ajax utters the word <foreign xml:lang="greek">tri/a</foreign>; here, he expresses it with his fingers. On the red-figured fragment in Bryn Mawr, described above (<ref target="iii.3" n="U">iii p. 3</ref>; on vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>), Ajax also says three with his hand. On the black-figured lekythos at Boston, Achilles says <foreign xml:lang="greek">te/ttara fe/rw</foreign>, Ajax <foreign xml:lang="greek">du/o fe/rw</foreign>, but the fingers are not extended.</p>

<p>The spears are sloped point downwards, instead of upwards as in the Vatican vase and nearly always elsewhere. Militarily this is all right — the fully ready position — ; but awkward for one's friends. It recurs on the neck-amphora by the Lysippides Painter in London, B 211.<note anchored="true" n="iii.5.4"><p><rs key="London B 211" type="Vase">London B 211</rs>: see above, <ref target="iii.3" n="U">iii p. 3</ref>, footnote 4 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>).</p></note></p>

<p>The chitoniskoi are black, with red spots. Achilles' chitoniskos is marked off from the background by an incised line. The corslets are of bronze. The thick cloaks are edged below with a zigzag line, summarily indicating folds. Folds are rendered more precisely in the piece of drapery running downward from the hither elbow in both figures. In Achilles, this piece is seen to continue on the chest, above the crook of the elbow; in <pb xml:id="iii.6" n="6"/> Ajax, the painter seems to have omitted to fill in the corresponding part. I do not see what this drapery can be but part of the cloak, although I must say that it does not look like it.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The cloak of Achilles is the more elaborate of the two. Three embattled lines run across the body of the garment, which is strewn with small patterns — spots, stars, crosses with dots in the angles, trios of addorsed arcs, and in the upper part, esses and pairs of maeander-hooks. The border in front is an embattled band, enhanced with dots and edged by dot-bands. The border of Ajax's cloak is indented instead of embattled, and the only patterns on the rest of it are spots, and crosses with dots, the painter's stock adornments for clothes, adopted from black-figure. For the patterns of the two borders compare the bilingual amphorae in London and Munich.</p>

<p>There is no thigh-armour. The greaves are edged with dots which indicate the attachment of the lining, whether by stitches or by small nails: actual archaic greaves are regularly edged with little holes. The thin dotted band round the ankles probably represents a pad against chafing, or the lower edge of such a pad, or the edge of the lining allowed to project. The knees of the greaves are decorated with the pair of brown lines which is the painter's vague formula for a knee. The inner side of each greave is ornamented with a long curl in black, and the outer side with the same curl, giving way, in the upper half, to a spiral. The proper place for a spiral is the inner side of a greave, since it is a stylization of the muscle of the calf: and that is where we find it in the many actual archaic greaves which have been preserved:<note anchored="true" n="iii.6.1"><p>Furtwängler <title>Olympia iv</title> pp. 159-60 with parts of pll. 60 and 61; Hagemann <title>Griechische Panzerung</title> pp. 132-9; <title>Jb.</title> 53, Olympiabericht ii pl. 40, pl. 41 right, pl. 42, pp. 98-100; <title>Jb.</title> 56 Olympiabericht iii pll. 47, 2-3, pll. 48-51, p. 117 left, pp. 115-18.</p></note> but vase-painters are not very scrupulous in this point; on the Louvre amphora <rs key="Louvre G 1" type="Vase">Louvre G 1</rs>, by the Andokides Painter, the spirals are in the right place, and so they are on his Faina vase; in the Palermo bilingual cup the red-figure warriors have the spiral on the inside of the leg, but two of the black-figure warriors have it on the outside; and in the London neck-amphora by the Lysippides Painter, <rs key="London B 211" type="Vase">London B 211</rs>, one hero has it on the inside, the other on the outside.<note anchored="true" n="iii.6.2"><p>Above, <ref target="iii.3" n="U">iii p. 3</ref>, footnote 4 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>).</p></note></p>

<p>The Corinthian helmets are alike except for the crest. There is a small palmette where the lower edge changes direction, and another at the outer corner of the eyehole. Ajax's crest-holder is attached to his helmet; Achilles' holder to a little wheel supported by a standard.<note anchored="true" n="iii.6.3"><p>For wheel crest-holders see Bothmer <title>Am.</title> pl. 5 with p. 18. Add a fragment of a bf. hydria, period of Lydos, in the Louvre; and the amphora Vatican G. 39 (<title>R.G.</title> pl. 14).</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The skulls of the heroes were drawn in the incised sketch. The contours of hair and beards are incised. The hair is black, the beards are red. The little curls on the forehead give place, at the temples, to a smooth edge. A red head-fillet is seen below each helmet. The long locks on the shoulders have a lank wet look as usual in our painter.</p>

<p>Hardly anything remains of the charges on the shields: in one a paw, in the other the tail, of a lion or panther: the devices must have been more or less like those in the black-figured picture, two felines with another charge between.</p>

<p>The drawing of the picture-borders is the same back and front, and they were no doubt executed by one artist, the Lysippides Painter rather than his colleague.</p>

<p>A red line on the outer edge of the mouth; on the neck; above the upper border; above the base-rays; on the edge of the foot-disk; a pair of red lines below the pictures. The base-fillet and the backs of the handle-flanges are red.</p>

<p>The black palmette at each handle is of the same simple type as in Leipsic, <rs key="Louvre F 204" type="Vase">Louvre F 204</rs>, Bologna, and Faina. In London, and Munich, the palmette has double spirals above.<note anchored="true" n="iii.6.4"><p>FR. i p. 15; <title>CV.</title> pl. 188, 2.</p></note></p>

<p>The technique of the red-figure picture is pre-canonical. Not only is there more red and more incision than in the developed red-figure technique, but first, the relief-line work is imperfect, and secondly the contour-band is scarcely used. So too in the other works of the Andokides Painter,<note anchored="true" n="iii.6.5"><p>Including the three new pieces described in <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 3-4 and 1617: the amphora in the Geneva market (Koutoulakis), the amphora in a Swiss private collection (<title>Jb.</title> 76 p. 49 and p. 50 fig. 2), the fragments of another in Taranto and Reggio.
</p>
<p>Furtwängler, who was the first to notice so many things, noticed this also in his description of the Berlin amphora <rs key="Berlin 2159" type="Vase">Berlin 2159</rs>.</p></note> and in some at least of the very early red-figure vases by other<pb xml:id="iii.7" n="7"/> artists (see <ref target="iii.9" n="U">iii p. 9</ref>; <rs key="Boston 03.790" type="Vase">Boston 03.790</rs>). In the developed technique, for instance in Euphronios or Euthymides, the first step in the painting is to outline the figure with a thick brush. The black pigment is a quick drier; and when the background comes to be filled in, this 'contour-band' does not merge with it, but remains distinguishable. It is naturally more obvious in those unfinished vases where the background was never filled in, but it is plain enough in nearly all vases. In the Andokides Painter the background is uniform and there is no contour-band to be seen. He did not begin that way, but by drawing the outline with a very thin brush.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In Achilles there is no relief-contour between the tip of the nose and the beard (including nostril and mouth), and none for the right hand or the feet. In Ajax, none for face, right thumb, right elbow, knee of greave, feet. Within the figures, the ears, the marks on the knees, and the lines near the lower edge of the corslet are without relief. Over other details one hesitates: the relief-line instrument may be used, but perhaps with the pigment diluted, so that a full relief-line is not produced. I am sorry not to be more explicit: one can nearly always be certain what is relief-line and what is not: here it is not so easy, and the notes I have taken at various times do not all agree.</p>

Studien</title> p. 36) takes this to be the same as on the bilingual amphorae <rs key="Louvre F 204" type="Vase">Louvre F 204</rs>, <rs key="London B 193" type="Vase">London B 193</rs>, and <rs key="Munich 2301" type="Vase">Munich 2301</rs>, but it is different. No doubt Etruscan.</p>

<p>I used to think of this as an early work of the Andokides Painter, but see now that it belongs to his middle period. The style is less mincing than in his early amphorae <rs key="Louvre G 1" type="Vase">Louvre G 1</rs> and <rs key="Berlin 2159" type="Vase">Berlin 2159</rs>.</p>

<p>The first reference to the vase is in <title>Bullettino</title> 1842 p. 187: it was then in Basseggio's possession and had been shown by Emil Braun at a meeting of the Archaeological Institute in Rome. Many of Basseggio's vases were found at Vulci.</p>

<p>The amphora is of Type A (see <ref target="iii.1" n="U">iii p. 1</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>). It is a little shorter than no. 114, and less slender; the mouth is broader and more flaring, the handles wider open, the foot broader, with the lower member projecting farther beyond the upper. The upper member of the foot is again black. There is a red line outside, on the upper edge of the mouth; on the lower edge; on the neck; above the upper picture-border; above the rays; and a pair below the lower border of the picture. There are no red lines on the foot; the base-fillet is black not red, and the backs of the handle-flanges are black. There are no handle-palmettes; and no graffito.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Of all the bilingual amphorae, this is that in which the two designs are most alike. There is very little difference even in detail. Herakles drives a bull to sacrifice, past a tree, holding his club in his right hand, and in his left the rope fastened round the horns of the bull, also a bundle of spits. He wears a chitoniskos, a lionskin, a belt, has sword and quiver slung, by crossbands, at his left flank, carries two small wineskins, apparently empty, over his left arm. The bull's head is filleted, and the woollen fillet has the form commonly used for this purpose as for others, tied at intervals and the ends splayed.</p>

<p>In the black-figure picture, the bow appears at the side as well as the quiver, and only the chape of the scabbard is seen. The chiton has fully three-dimensional folds, and every other fold is washed with red. The left calf of Herakles is missing. and part of his right <pb xml:id="iii.8" n="8"/> foot, a little of the tree, part of the bull's right fore-hoof and of its neck with a stretch of the fillet. The contours are incised. Red for the beard of Herakles, his belt, parts of the quiver, the tufts of the mane, the hither wineskin, the bull's testicles and fillet, alternate lines on its neck, the edgeing of the incised lines representing the ribs and of one incised line on the hind-quarters. White for the crossbands and the lion's teeth.</p>

<p>In the red-figure picture, a fracture has removed the lower lip and the tip of the nose; another, part of the left elbow; a third passes through the toes of the right foot. The left foot is missing, with the right hind-hoof of the bull. The movement is somewhat freer than in the other picture. The chitoniskos has the same 'black-figure' patterns as the cloak of Ajax on no. 114 (<ref target="iii.6" n="U">iii p. 6</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>). The hilt is dotted; for the shape compare the amphora in the Faina collection; for the lionskin, tree, club, the Louvre amphora <rs key="Louvre F 204" type="Vase">Louvre F 204</rs>; for the club, <rs key="London B 193" type="Vase">London B 193</rs>.</p>

<p>The greater part of the human figure has relief-contour; but not the face, the front of the lionskin, the left hand, the knees, the toes, the knots of the club, the crosspiece of the hilt, the arrows, the cover of the quiver. Parts of the bull are contoured with relief-lines. The contour-band appears at the knees of Herakles and at the cover of the quiver: but nowhere else. The tree has relief-contour. Within the figure of Herakles, brown is used for the markings on the knees, for the fingers and toes, the right wrist, the elbows, the hooks at the ends of the lines on the thighs and on the left forearm, the lower side of the right ankle-bone, the arrows, the lion's eye and the detail of its head, the binding of the wineskins, the pair of lines at the base of the bull's horn. The baldrick is brown. Red for the lion's jowl (with incised strokes), the off wineskin, the horizontal lines on the quiver, the rope, the bull's fillet, the leaves. The beard and hair of Herakles are in raised black dots on a black ground.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In the double-floral band above the picture there are red details as well as incised, whereas in the band above the black-figure picture there are incised details only.</p>

<p>Furtwängler was the first to recognize the subject of the Boston vase,<note anchored="true" n="iii.8.1"><p>In FR. i p. 16.</p></note> and Hauser to identify the object in the left hand of Herakles as a bundle of spits secured by slides.<note anchored="true" n="iii.8.2"><p>In FR. ii p. 336.</p></note> Such bundles are seen elsewhere, for instance in the pictures of Herakles and Busiris by the Troilos Painter on his hydria in Munich and the Pan Painter on his pelike in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.8.3"><p><rs key="Munich 2428" type="Vase">Munich 2428</rs>: FR. pl. 73, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 191 no. 12; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 297 no. 13. <title>Pan-Maler</title> pl. 8: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 364 no. 41; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 554 no. 82.</p></note></p>

<p>Furtwängler thought of the last sacrifice on Mount Kenaion: but it is doubtful whether the painter can have had that in mind. Herakles sacrificed bulls on many occasions: for instance to Chryse, or after raiding the cattle of Geryon.<note anchored="true" n="iii.8.4"><p>Hooker in <title>JHS.</title> 70 pp. 35-41; Bielefeld in <title>Wissensch.

<p>This is a riper and better work than no. 114, and the flabbiness of the painter's early figures has gone.</p>

<p>(Height of the fragment 0.133). <title>RM.</title> 16 pl. 5 and p. 119 (Hartwig). A, Dionysos and <pb xml:id="iii.9" n="9"/> satyr; B, Dionysos and Ariadne. About 525 B.C. (<title>VA.</title> p. 5; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 12; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 11 no. 2).</p>

<p>This unique vase is of the same type as many small black-figured neck-amphorae, and was evidently decorated by a black-figure painter, exceptionally with pictures in red-figure. The pattern-bands and the floral designs at the handles are exactly as in black-figure. The red-figure panels have no side-border to frame them off from the black-figure areas, only a relief-line. The handles are triple; the fillet between neck and body is red.</p>

<p>A. Dionysos sits on a campstool, with a kantharos in one hand and a spreading branch of ivy in the other. He wears a long chiton, a himation, and an ivy-wreath. In front of him a satyr dances, with head full-face, and one knee almost touching the ground.</p>

<p>B. Dionysos, dressed in long chiton and himation, sits on a simple block, holding an ivy-branch in his right hand, while his left hand rests on his thigh, holding his himation and concealed by it. A woman sits opposite him on a seat which has no back but richly ornamented legs, extending her left arm, talking to him. She wears a peplos, a himation draped over the right shoulder and the left arm, a wreath, and large ear-rings. It is Ariadne, or perhaps Semele. For the seat compare the more elaborate examples in Richter <title>Ancient Furniture</title> figs. 33-34; for the ear-rings, the vases of the Andokides Painter.</p>

<p>The technique is very early red-figure. There is no contour-band (see <ref target="iii.6" n="U">iii p. 6</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8037" type="Vase">Boston 01.8037</rs>). Parts of the figures have relief-contour. The following parts have not: on A, face and feet of Dionysos, the knees of the satyr; on B, face, neck, toes, left hand of Ariadne, the feet of Dionysos, the front of his right leg, the handle part of his branch. Within the contours, the following parts are done in brown and not in black: the faces — eyes, brows, nostrils, mouths, ears; on A, the fingers and feet of Dionysos, the details of his sleeve, and the lower edge of his himation; the fingers and toes of the satyr, the details of his right knee, the arcs on his thigh; on B, the toes. With the exceptions just given, the details of the male bodies are in relief-lines. Red is used for the beards, for the leaves of the branches, for every other leaf of the god's wreath, and most of the leaves of Ariadne's; incision for the contours of the hair, the outline and ends of Dionysos' beard, the upper edge of the satyr's beard and the outline of his moustache, the outlines of the wreaths, and two lines on the kantharos. The incised sketch is deep.</p>

<p>The garments are patterned in black-figure taste: the chiton of Dionysos on A with small crosses, the himatia with small crosses, and larger crosses having dots in the angles, the peplos of Ariadne with the same in diamond-shaped compartments. On A, the himation of Dionysos has a broad border above, an indented line with v's in the angles; on B, his chiton has an ess-border below.</p>

<p>The artist is trying his hand at emulating the Andokides Painter. It ought to be possible to find black-figure neck-amphorae by him, but I have not succeeded.

<p>Eros flies to right, holding out a head-fillet. This, and the wreath, of smilax or the like, round the hair, are done in red, and do not show in the photograph: see the drawing in <title>VA</title>. p. 7. On the right, part of a large palmette, of the 'closed' type — the petals not separated — usual in the earliest red-figure.</p>

<p>Relief-contour, except for the lower side of the nose, the outline of the lips, the tips of the wings, the lowest petal preserved, and the highest. The chin seems contoured with a relief-line. The line contouring the knee is thinner than the other contour-lines. The contour of the hair is reserved. Brown for the spots on the coverts, and for the engrailed line dividing them from the quills. For the wings compare cups by Oltos in the Louvre and in Florence.<note anchored="true" n="iii.10.1"><p><rs key="Louvre F 127" type="Vase">Louvre F 127</rs>: A, Pottier pl. 73: <title>CV</title>. b pl. 1, 9 and pl. 2, 2-5; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 35 no. 13; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 55 no. 14.

<p>Most of Oltos's works are cups, but many of his best are pots. Our fragment comes from a pot. What the shape was is uncertain: the curvature would suit an amphora or a hydria. Reserved inside; the wall not thin. Not easy to reconstruct the subject: possibly a pair of Erotes with a plant between?</p>

<p>In any case, Eros is associated here, as often, with plant-life;<note anchored="true" n="iii.10.2"><p><title>Lewes House Gems</title> p. 27; Greifenhagen <title>Griechische Eroten</title> pp. 6-12, p. 72, and p. 81.</p></note> for the palmette is not a mere decorative motive, but a plant.</p>

<p>This is an early Oltos, though not one of the very earliest.</p>

The handles, as in Type A, are concave. The unsigned kantharos in London is also of Type C; and, to judge from the curve of the bowl, the fragment in Odessa may have been. A generation later, Douris fashioned, decorated, and signed a splendid kantharos of Type <pb xml:id="iii.11" n="11"/> C, <rs key="Brussels A 718" type="Vase">Brussels A 718</rs>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.1"><p>FR pl. 74, 1; <title>CV</title>. pll. 5-6: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 292 no. 197; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 445 no. 256.</p></note> The kantharos by the Sosias Painter, <rs key="Athens, Acr. 556" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 556</rs>, only fragments of which remain,<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.2"><p>Langlotz pl. 42: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 21 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 21 no. 2.</p></note> may have been of this type: it would come between those by Nikosthenes and that by Douris.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The exact form of the foot in Boston (<rs key="Boston 00.334" type="Vase">Boston 00.334</rs>) can be made out from the photographs. The potter has rounded off the upper edge of the torus, both towards the foot-profile, and towards the foot-jog, which is also rounded; and the black of the upper side is continued a good way down the profile, even at the expense of restricting the space for the inscription. This is very much the same foot as Nikosthenes used for many of his 'Nicosthenic' neck-amphorae; and his variant of Cup A<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.3"><p>Bloesch <title>FAS</title>. pp. 23-25.</p></note> shows the same attitude towards the foot.</p>

<p>The jog at the level of the handles is so slight that it might escape notice at first glance. In the London kantharos it has disappeared: but, to compensate, the jog on the foot is not rounded: the 'punctuation' is shifted but not abolished, and the case is the same as in lip-cup and band-cup.<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.4"><p>See <title>Dev</title>. p. 53.</p></note></p>

<p>Douris's version of the shape is more massive and powerful, the bowl deeper, the stem shorter; there is no jog on the top of the foot, but the foot-profile is reserved and the upper edge of it is not rounded away: another shift of punctuation.</p>

<p>Of the five kantharoi fashioned by Nikosthenes, the fragment in Odessa is signed by the painter Epiktetos. The rest were decorated by another artist, the Nikosthenes Painter.</p>

<p>On one side of our kantharos, Dionysos stands, setting one foot forward, at a lighted altar, over which he pours wine from his kantharos. A woman, a maenad, stands facing him, looking down and stretching her arms straight downwards, with the hands open. A flat basket with scooped-out side stands on the ground at her feet: it is the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign>, often seen in pictures of sacrifices, which contains the lighter requisites of the cult.<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.5"><p>See <ref target="iii.77" n="U">iii p. 77</ref> (<rs key="Boston 95.25" type="Vase">Boston 95.25</rs>).</p></note> Here the sides are solid: they are often voided. Reisch has aptly compared the group of Dionysos and the maenad with two figures on a contemporary cup, by the Ambrosios Painter, in Würzburg,<note anchored="true" n="iii.11.6"><p>See <ref target="iii.78" n="U">iii p. 78</ref>, footnote 1 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 95.25" type="Vase">Boston 95.25</rs>).</p></note> and conjectured that the maenad is strewing handfuls of groats (<foreign xml:lang="greek">o)lai/</foreign>) on the altar, groats taken from the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign> beside her on the ground. To left of this pair, a maenad dances; to right of them, another, less vigorously. Behind the left-hand maenad a thyrsus stands or leans.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Between the volutes of the altar there is a rough band of egg-pattern, and on either side of the band a dot, which might seem to have strayed from the oculus of the volute. In the base of the altar the artist must be indicating curvilinear mouldings.</p>

<p>Dionysos and the right-hand maenad are dressed in long chitons, and himatia of 'Ionic' mode. The other maenads wear the chiton only; in the woman at the altar the girdle is concealed by the kolpos; in the other it is exposed. The women have bracelets. All four heads are wreathed; the left-hand one with ivy, the rest with nondescript leaves. Relief-contours, except for mouth and lips of the right-hand maenad, and the lower side of her nose. Brown for the crinkled lines on the upper parts of the chitons and on the himation. In the left-hand figure the loose ends of the hair are in relief-lines. The contour of her hair is incised; in the others it is partly incised, partly reserved. Red for the wreaths, the wine, and the flame.</p>

<p>On the subject see also Erika Simon <title>Opfernde Götter</title> pp. 50-57.</p>

<p>On the other side of the vase, Dionysos reclines on the ground with one elbow on a doubled cushion. He holds a drinking-horn in one hand, and in the other a great branch, from which vine-leaves grow, and ivy as well. He turns his head round towards a satyr who approaches with a wineskin over his shoulder. At the feet of the god, another satyr, with his left foot raised, holds a pointed amphora by the end and balances it over his left thigh. On the left, a skin flute-case hangs, with the mouthpiece-box. The satyrs have a grave appearance and extend one arm to announce their presence. The dominant in the picture is the violent turn of Dionysos's head, and the painter must have been pleased with it. The god's himation is let down to his waist, and he wears a saccos, really a woman's <pb xml:id="iii.12" n="12"/> head-dress. So do many revellers on vases,<note anchored="true" n="iii.12.1"><p>See <ref target="ii.56" n="U">ii p. 56, footnote 2</ref> (vase description for <rs key="Boston 13.199" type="Vase">Boston 13.199</rs>).</p></note> but I do not remember it worn by a god elsewhere.</p>

<p>The satyrs are wreathed with ivy, and so is the amphora. The hair-contour of the left-hand satyr is incised, that of the right-hand one partly incised and partly reserved. The front-contour of Dionysos' beard has a relief-line on either side of it. His nostril is a brown line. The anatomy of his middle is very formal, but the technique — relief-lines, and the hollows washed with brown — is the same as on the calyx-krater by Euphronios in the Louvre and other masterpieces of the time. The drinking-horn has a metal mouthpiece, silver or gold. Brown strokes indicate the fur of the flute-case. There are brown stripes on the cushion as well as black. Red for the wreaths and leaves.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The lower part of the kantharos has two scenes which are often coupled and which readily adapt themselves to a shallow picture-space: Herakles and the Lion, Herakles and the Bull. Herakles is beardless in both; and in both the direction is right to left instead of the much more usual left to right. We take the Lion picture first, as it is slightly the more elaborate. Herakles, kneeling and bending over, grasps the lion's left hind-leg with his left hand, forces its forepart down, and presses his right arm round its neck to throttle it. The lion, which is rather small, strikes at the hero's forehead with its right hind-paw. Behind the group, a tree, as often in this scene, serves to fill the background above the figures. On the right, Iolaos, squatting, seen partly from behind, extends his left arm in encouragement, and holds a spear in his right hand. He wears a chlamys, and a petasos (with chin-strap) of the Robin Hood sort. The artist has drawn the right knee, but not the right shank and foot. The bow and quiver hang under the handle to right.</p>

<p>On the other side of the vase, Herakles kneels, holding the bull by one horn. The binding is nearly completed. On the right are his bow and quiver, suspended. To right of them, under the handle, is a tree, with the hero's mantle spread out on it.</p>

<p>In these two minor pictures, the contours have relief. The hair-contours are reserved. Herakles wears a head-fillet when contending with the bull. This, and the rope, are in red. The anatomy of the middles is in the technique already described.</p>

<p>A band of ray-pattern runs round the vase below the pictures, separated from them by a thin brown line. The rays, which are blunt, are edged with relief-lines. There are several pentimenti — where relief-lines had been drawn in wrong places.</p>

<p>This is a quaint work. It does not reach the point at which one says 'Why learn to draw, if such good results can be obtained without?' But it is on the way.</p>

<p>Reisch, in the prime publication, had already associated the style with red-figure vases bearing the signature of the potter Pamphaios. Several painters collaborated with Pamphaios, but many of the cups with his signature are in fact by the same hand as the Boston kantharos.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>We call the artist the Nikosthenes Painter. Like many vase-painters whose general level was not high, he could surpass himself on occasion and rise to a great height: for the Sleep and Death cup in the British Museum must be his.</p>

<p>A word about the other Boston kantharos with the signature of Nikosthenes, <rs key="Boston 95.61" type="Vase">Boston 95.61</rs>, not published here.<note anchored="true" n="iii.12.2"><p>See <ref target="iii.10" n="U">iii p. 10</ref>, footnote 3 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.334" type="Vase">Boston 00.334</rs>).</p></note> The general style is akin to that of the Epeleios Group, although one or two particulars recall the Nikosthenes Painter.</p>

<p>The cup is of delicate make, with foot of Type C, but without the offset rim which is<pb xml:id="iii.13" n="13"/> usual in cups of that type. Underneath, the bottom of the bowl is decorated with a dot within two circles. The handles are missing.</p>

<p>Inside, the sphinx stands on a ground-line, with the left fore-paw raised and set against the line-border. The front of this fore-paw is missing, with a stretch of the border above it. The outline of the hair is incised. Red for the wreath (hardly visible in our reproduction), which curls round the back of the head three-dimensionally, as usual in Skythes, and for the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E[*P]*I*L*U*K[*O*S] *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Outside on one half, Dionysos moves quickly to right, followed by a satyr holding a wineskin. Dionysos wears a long chiton, and a himation over both shoulders. He was doubtless looking back. Red for the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A . . .</foreign>.</p>

<p>On the other half, komos. A naked youth runs to right, a stick in his right hand, an oinochoe held out in his left. He is preceded by another youth, partly in back-view, who looks round, extending his left arm with his himation hung over it, and flourishing his stick. Red for his wreath. The hair-contour is incised.</p>

<p>Under each handle there was a floral design: parts of the tendrils remain. To left and right of each handle is a prancing Pegasus. One at least of the horses under the right handle was muzzled; those under the left handle are bridled but not muzzled.</p>

<p>Relief-contours throughout.</p>

<p>'Handle-animals' are a rather common motive in red-figured cups of this period, as well as earlier in black-figured cups: sphinxes, griffins, pegasi.

<p>The outside may have been decorated. Inside, on a ground-line, a satyr clasps a maenad, who looks round as she flees and raises her right hand. Her left hand holds a snake. She wears a chiton and a panther-skin, belted. On the left, part of an object — phallus rather than thyrsus? Relief-contours. Short relief-strokes for the pattern on the upper part of her chiton. Relief-lines also for the loose strands in front of her ear, for the ends of the satyr's beard and of his hair at the shoulder. The outline of her hair is incised. Red for his wreath, which has the same peculiarity as in no. 119; for the maenad's head-fillet; and for the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*I*L*U*K*O[*S...</foreign>.</p>

<p>Outside, below the picture, a reserved line. Eros, as it should be, flies, nearly horizontal, to right, holding out a wreath. Above his head, the right root of one handle began. The figure therefore occupied the space under the handle. On the right, the leg of a seat, it seems, and some drapery, probably the himation of the person seated. Relief contour, except for the lips (the mouth is a relief-line). The outline of the hair is reserved. Red for the wreath — of vine-leaves one would say — on the head, and the wreath, of small leaves, in the hands. The handle-root, as not infrequently, is bordered by a relief-line.</p>

<p>The remains on the shoulder of the figure are probably the beginning of the wing, which in early red-figure often covers the shoulder, for example in Athens (<rs key="Athens, Acr. 163" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 163</rs>) by the Euergides Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.4.2"><p>Langlotz pl. 6: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 60 no. 24: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 90 no. 30.</p></note></p>

<p>Three fragments in Florence (one of which was formerly in Villa Giulia), and one recently acquired by the British Museum (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 26 no. 17 and 18), must be from the same cup. All have a coral-red coating inside, which in three of them (the upper parts being preserved) is seen to give place, over half an inch from the rim-reserve, to a black band.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Outside, one of the Florence fragments (<title>CV</title>. pl. 7 B 3; <title>CF</title>. pl. 7, 24: Plate 19, <foreign xml:lang="greek">e</foreign>) has parts of three figures seated to right. First, two side by side, one of them with extended arm. Both wear long chiton and himation. The hither one sits on a campstool. The off one has a kolpos and is female. Then one wearing a himation and seated on a throne. The second Florence fragment (<title>CV</title>. pl. 7 B 2; <title>CF</title>. pl. Y, 9: Plate 19, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>) has the head of a woman in a saccos, to right, and a little of one shoulder: the arm seems to have been extended. The third Florence fragment, ex Villa Giulia (<title>CF.</title> pl. Y, 23: Plate 19, <foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>) has the raised right hand, holding up an oinochoe, of a smaller person, a cup-bearer, to left, with the ends of the forehead-hair and the tip of the wreath on the head; further, inscriptions: first, the signature of the painter, <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*D*E*S</foreign> with <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*E*G*R*A]*F*S*E*N</foreign> below it; secondly, the signature of the potter <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*E*P]*O*E*I</foreign> (very little of the omikron remains); thirdly, <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*O*S</foreign>, ending a word. These four fragments were put together, as probably from one cup, in <title>CF</title>. p. 14, and in <title>ARV.1</title> p. 26 no. 17. No. 18 there is a fragment which was at one time in the Italian market and which until recently I knew from a photograph only. I could not even tell if it had coral-red inside. It has now been acquired by the British Museum (1952.12.-2.7) and is reproduced in Suppl. Plate 19, <foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign>. The interior is coral-red, with a black band above. Outside, parts of two figures, both female: of one, facing left, the saccos, with the edge of one shoulder; of the other, facing right, the back of the head, which is bound with a scarf, the ear, ear-ring, the shoulders. The minor lines of the himation are in brown. The upper edge of the chiton is seen before the fragment ends. Two rows of dots edge the hair below the reserve. The loose strands below the ear-ring are in relief-lines. The hand, holding a red flower, between the two figures may belong to the outstretched arm of a third person on the right, but may also be the raised right hand of the woman in the saccos, who would be seen from behind. To left of the hand and above it the black of the background is damaged. An inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*L*U*Q*U*A</foreign>, runs rightward and somewhat upward from the saccos.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Two more fragments of the same cup are in Naples, in the collection of Mr. Mario Astarita (Suppl. Pl. 19, <foreign xml:lang="greek">d</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">h</foreign>). The interior in both is coral-red. Fragment <foreign xml:lang="greek">d</foreign> has parts of persons seated to right: three side by side, and one in front of them. All four wear himatia, and two at least of them a chiton as well. The middle figure of the trio has a kolpos and must be female. The hither person holds a staff, sceptre or the like. Fragment <foreign xml:lang="greek">h</foreign> has the lower end of a sceptre or staff, and parts of the legs of persons seated in the other direction, to left, one of whom wears the himation only and is male. The minor lines of the himation are in brown, hardly visible in the photograph.</p>

<p>The name of the goddess Eileithyia has many forms, both in literature and in inscriptions.<note anchored="true" n="iii.4.3"><p>Kretschmer <title>Vaseninschriften</title> pp. 156-8</p></note> On Attic vases it is regularly aspirated. If one of the persons is Eileithyia, the subject can hardly have been anything but the Birth of Athena: treated somewhat as on a <pb xml:id="iii.15" n="15"/> contemporary cup, by the Poseidon Painter, in the British Museum, with deities seated round:<note anchored="true" n="iii.15.1"><p><rs key="London E 15" type="Vase">London E 15</rs>: <title>El</title>. 1 pl. 63 <title>Jahrbuch Mainz</title> 8 pl. 35, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 112, above, no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 136.</p></note> but whereas the style of the London cup is very discreditable, our cup must have been a masterpiece of the Parade style, equalling the Sosias cup in Berlin and the Peleus cup by Euphronios in Athens.</p>

<p>The cup-bearer on the Villa Giulia fragment may be serving Zeus: if so, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*S</foreign> may be part of <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*D*I]*O*S</foreign> rather than of a kalos-inscription.</p>

<p>Much is doubtful here: we cannot be sure whether there were two pictures outside the cup, one in each half, or, as is more likely, only one picture extending over both halves.</p>

<p>I ought to have said that the seven fragments are not quite to scale in our reproduction. For the style, compare especially the amphora by Euthymides in the Louvre.<note anchored="true" n="iii.15.2"><p><rs key="Louvre G 44" type="Vase">Louvre G 44</rs>: Hoppin <title>Euthymides and his Fellows</title>, pll. 15-16, and, from my drawing, p. 61; <title>CV</title>. pl. 29, 1-4 and 6 and pl. 30, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 25 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 27 no. 3.</p></note> We have fragments, I believe, of another, smaller cup by Euthymides: for I now take <rs key="Athens, Acr. 211" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 211</rs> to be his.<note anchored="true" n="iii.15.3"><p>Langlotz pl. 10: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 29 no. 20.</p></note></p>

Our fragment goes particularly closely with the two hydriai just mentioned — <rs key="Aberdeen 695" type="Vase">Aberdeen 695</rs> and <rs key="London E 162" type="Vase">London E 162</rs>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.15.4"><p><rs key="Aberdeen 695" type="Vase">Aberdeen 695</rs>: <title>JHS</title> 70 pp. 29 and 31 (Martin Robertson): <title>ARV.1</title> p. 140 no. 127; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 209 no. 164. <rs key="London E 162" type="Vase">London E 162</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 70, 3; <title>JHS</title>. 70 p. 27 fig. 5: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 140 no. 28; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 209 no. 165.</p></note></p>

<p>Herakles, moving smartly to left and looking back, leads Cerberus, who has an obedient look, by a chain with a cord handle. His club was probably in his right hand. On the left, Athena stands, holding her helmet in her left hand. On the right, the right hand of Hermes is seen, and, above, his petasos, slung round his neck, and the edge of his hair. He must have been looking back to right. Athena may have been the closing figure on the right, as, for example, in the black-figured amphora, of the Leagros Group, <rs key="Vatican 372" type="Vase">Vatican 372</rs>, or the red-figured <rs key="Munich 2306" type="Vase">Munich 2306</rs>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.15.5"><p>Vatican: Albizzati pl. 50: <title>ABV</title>. p. 368 no. 107.

<p>Herakles wears a chitoniskos under his lionskin; Athena, chiton and aegis. The figures are contoured with relief-lines. There is much brown detail, for lines on the chitons, on the arms of Herakles, on the head of Cerberus, and for the dots of the aegis. The compressed nostril of Herakles is in brown lines. The lionskin is washed with brown and strewn with darker dots and strokes. The black background encroaches on the upper tips of the mane. Red for Athena's head-fillet, her bracelet, the chain of Cerberus with its cord, and the cord of the petasos.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The shoulder has a design of palmettes and lotus-flowers, doubled; above this, and not ruled off from it, a band of egg-pattern. Most of the contours are in relief, but not those of the petals. The floral is separated from the figures by a reserved line. Doubtful whether the picture was framed.</p>

<p>The hydria is of kalpis type, with the picture, not framed, on the shoulder. The Berlin Painter has left many such hydriai; this is later than most of them.</p>

<p>There was doubtless another figure on the left. The old man was probably seated, with his himation let down to his waist. He wears a chiton, holds a crutch-topped stick in his left hand and touches his beard, meditatively, with his right thumb and forefinger.<note anchored="true" n="iii.16.1"><p>For this gesture see <ref target="iii.72" n="U">iii p. 72</ref> (<rs key="Boston 99.539" type="Vase">Boston 99.539</rs>).</p></note> There is little relief-contour, only for the upper half of the skull, for the forefinger and lower edge of the right hand, for the shaft of the stick.

</list>
<p>In the black-figured amphorae of Type C the foot is echinus-shaped as in Type B, and many of the red-figured examples retain this foot, while others substitute the foot of the neck-amphora — a stout torus, with base-fillet. Our vase has the echinus foot, and so have <rs key="Vienna 3724" type="Vase">Vienna 3724</rs>, and <rs key="Louvre G 220" type="Vase">Louvre G 220</rs>; the other Type-C's by our painter have the torus foot, with base-fillet.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Most red-figured amphorae of this type are decorated in 'Nolan' fashion, with a single figure on each side, unframed. All those by the Flying-angel Painter have this kind of decoration. There is usually a reserved line for the figures to stand on; and the Boston vase has base-rays, with a red line above them, also a pair of red lines running round the vase below the ground-lines. The handles are stout, round, and black, as in Type B. In <pb xml:id="iii.17" n="17"/> our vase there is a thin reserved band at the lower edge of the mouth, and a thicker one inside at the top of the mouth.</p>

<p>Our vase has a special graffito (see below). As many as seven out of nine Type-C's by the Flying-angel Painter (in two of the eleven the foot is missing) have the graffito <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*A</foreign>; another vase of the same shape, by a different painter, has the same, Milan, <rs key="Scala 416" type="Vase">Scala 416</rs>, by the Tyszkiewicz Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.17.1"><p><title>ARV.1</title> p. 187 no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 292 no. 33.</p></note></p>

<p>The subject of the Boston vase was probably suggested to the painter by the festival of Dionysos, and in particular by the procession at the Rural Dionysia of which Aristophanes gives a glimpse in his <title>Acharnians</title>: here, however, the celebrants are not ordinary Athenians, but satyrs. On one side of the vase a satyr elevates the phallus which formed the core of the procession, and wags it with a grin. On the other side a satyr has lifted his little son on to his shoulders, 'flying-angel', so as to give him a good view. This is one of our earliest representations of a satyr child, and perhaps the earliest of all.<note anchored="true" n="iii.17.2"><p>For other early ones see Brommer <title>Satyroi</title> p. 56 and <title>Satyrspiele</title> pp. 35-38 and 46.</p></note></p>

<p>Relief-contour. Brown for the minor details of the bodies. Red for the wreath of the satyr on A, the head-fillets of the child and of the satyr on B, and the inscription on A, IC<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*L*O*S</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>) written downwards. Restored, the child's chin, part of his chest and arms, his father's right knee and left heel. The surface is damaged in places, and some of the relief-lines have lost their black and are distinguishable as furrows only.</p>

<p>I never noted the graffito on the bottom of the vase, but know it from Miss Chapman's drawing. One sees what may be a monogram of lambda and upsilon, followed by the letters <foreign xml:lang="greek">gluxn</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="greek">luxn</foreign> may be for <foreign xml:lang="greek">lu/xn(oi)</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">lu/xn(os)</foreign>; <foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign> might be the numeral three. The monogram recurs on a neck-amphora, later than our vase, by the Alkimachos Painter, in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2343" type="Vase">Munich 2343</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 209, 1-2, pl. 211, 1-3, pl. 216, 5; and the graffiti, p. 7: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 356 no. 15; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 531 no. 27); and on a small pelike, still later, about 440 B.C., in my possession, where it is accompanied by an iota or vertical stroke.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B. The potter-work is by Python (Bloesch <title>F.A.S.</title> p. 100 no. 34). The underside has Python's characteristic form.</p>

<p>The long career of Douris may be roughly divided into four periods: (1) very early, and early; (2) early middle; (3) middle; (4) late. In periods 1 and 2 the favourite kalos-name is Chairestratos; in period 3, Hippodamas; in period 4, kalos-names are rare, but there are Polyphrasmon and Hiketes. Our cup is very early in the first period: of the signed vases, only the arming cup in Vienna is earlier;<note anchored="true" n="iii.17.3"><p><rs key="Vienna 3694" type="Vase">Vienna 3694</rs>: <title>FR</title> pl. 53, whence Hoppin i pp. 266-7; <title>CV</title>. pll. 9-10: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 280 no. 6; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 427 no. 3.</p></note> also very early, <rs key="Louvre G 122" type="Vase">Louvre G 122</rs><note anchored="true" n="iii.17.4"><p>Hoppin i p. 258: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 280 no. 6; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 428 no. 10.

<p>The decoration of the present cup is of the 'bare' type which Douris uses in his Chairestratos period, as opposed to the 'richer' type which he adopts in the period of Hippodamas. Bare decoration: figures only; no palmettes at the handles; and the simplest of all borders — a line round the tondo, a line under the pictures outside.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>At this point we give the inscriptions. Inside, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*O*R*I*S*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>. Outside, on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*X*A*I]*R*E*S*T*R*A*T*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, on B, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X[*A*I*R]*E*S*T*R*A*T*O[*S]*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. In his earliest signatures Douris does not use the letter-form <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L?</foreign>, which appears on the cup with the Arms of Achilles, <rs key="Vienna 3695" type="Vase">Vienna 3695</rs>, and thenceforth. Here we may also mention the two graffiti on the underside of the foot, visible in the photographs: one is an Etruscan alpha, the other a mark in the form of a Greek upsilon with a crossbar at the end of each arm.</p>

<p>Inside, a young athlete moves to left, his right arm extended, a discus held with his left hand and lying against the inside of the left forearm. The hair is rolled up and tied with a cord. Behind him, a pick, and, suspended, a pair of halt&emacr;res. Long legs and feet, long right arm with large hand, small middle, abrupt transition from frontal chest to profile hip, thin neck, the eye set low: compare the athletes on the Berlin cup <rs key="Berlin 2283" type="Vase">Berlin 2283</rs>, which seems a little later.</p>

<p>Debated, whether any moment in the process of discus-throwing is represented, or whether this is simply an athlete, discus in hand, moving towards the field. More probably, I think, he is already in preliminary action, at the very beginning of the process, almost the same moment as in the statue of the standing discobolos.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. For the brown lines on the body the photograph fails us, and we must turn to the drawing published by Reisch and Hartwig, where they are rendered pretty accurately. Red for the head-fillet and the cord from which the halt&emacr;res hang.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Outside, battle. In each half, a well-planned symmetrical group of three. On A, a young warrior, sword in hand, strides towards a man who is down, but tries to rise, drawing his sword; a young companion, with drawn sword, comes to his help. On B, a youth with drawn sword attacks another who has turned tail and fallen on one knee, but strikes back with his spear; a third youth, with a spear, advances to defend him.</p>

<p>Hartwig has aptly compared and contrasted the pictures with a contemporary battle-piece, an early work of the Panaitios Painter, <rs key="Boston 01.8021" type="Vase">Boston 01.8021</rs> (no. 75: Plate XXXIX). Another comparison might be with a fragmentary cup in Brunswick and Florence.<note anchored="true" n="iii.18.2"><p><title>CV</title>. Brunswick pl. 13: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 917 no. 10; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1567 no. 1.</p></note> The general nature of the drawing, to speak broadly, is the same: the figures on the other two cups are more supple and the movements even more vigorous: but our cup is also of fine quality. Unusual, and unexpected in Douris, the terror in the face of the fallen man; and the indication of middle age, the hair thinned at the temples.</p>

<p>There is heroic nudity, but not fully carried out as in the other two cups. We have, on the one party, light-armed troops, wearing chlamys and petasos only; on the other, warriors armed with the helmet and shield of the hoplite, but otherwise naked; two of them use spears, the third comes to close quarters with the sword; the light-armed use swords. On A, one party is in trouble; on B, the other.</p>

<p>The helmets are of Attic type and have hinged cheek-pieces, which are not let down. The shield-devices are three rings (one of which is damaged), and a bull's head caboshed. Four of the scabbards are seen to be ornamented with a snake. The fallen warrior on B has no sword. Four mouths are open; the mouth of the warrior on the left of A is closed; in the corresponding figure on B this part is damaged.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Much of the brown inner marking is lost in the photographs. The black petasos on A is unusual. Red for the baldricks, the petasos-cords, and the inscriptions.</p>

<p>Outside, the surface is fretted in places; missing, the chin, neck, upper right arm of the left-hand warrior on B, with part of his chlamys.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B. Warren took the foot to be alien, but probably an ancient restoration: I was not sure that it did not belong: it is at least of the right shape, a Python foot. The handles are modern.</p>

<p>The decoration is of the 'bare' type described above. The cup belongs to Douris's second period, the late part of it.</p>

<p>Komos. The revellers are all men, and all naked except two, who wear wraps over their shoulders. The man inside stands on one leg, the right, which is frontal, and raises his left leg over a cup which stands on a low block. On the left, his himation lies folded on a seat, which has a cushion. The attitude of the left-hand man on A is similar, though not the same. Both men are preparing to perform one of those 'tricks with cups' which are often represented in komos scenes. In the grandest of these pictures, on the psykter by Douris in the British Museum, the performers are not men but satyrs;<note anchored="true" n="iii.19.1"><p><rs key="London E 768" type="Vase">London E 768</rs>: FR. pl. 48, whence Hoppin i p. 242; <title>CV</title>. pl. 105: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 292 no. 201; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 446 no. 262.</p></note> and quite a pleasing turn is given by a girl on a hydria by Polygnotos in Naples.<note anchored="true" n="iii.19.2"><p><rs key="Naples 3232" type="Vase">Naples 3232</rs>: FR. pl. 171, 1 and p. 321: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 681 no. 55; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1032 no. 61.</p></note> In our cup one can only guess what the trick is to consist of and what the next move will be.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Relief-contours. Brown lines for the inner marking of the body, few of which are clear in the photograph. A repainted fracture runs through the toes of the right foot. Red for the head-fillet and for the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L?*O*R*I*S*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>.</p>

<p>Outside, the movement is leftward, but some of the men turn round. On each half there are two groups — a four (composed of two pairs), and a pair. In the middle of A, a man playing the flute, and another, who holds a skyphos, facing him; the flute-player is followed by two men with cups, one of whom turns his face towards us. On the left, the man preparing for the trick, and another who holds out a cup. In the middle of B a man capers, while another holds his skyphos for him, as well as his own cup. This pair is followed by two men with cups, one of whom has an oinochoe as well. The first probably looks round at the second — the head is lost. On the left, a lyre-player, facing round towards his companion, a man with a cup. Parts of the surface are in poor condition, and many of the fine brown lines on the bodies have disappeared. Missing or damaged (besides the major losses clear from the drawing): in A, right shoulder and left arm of 1, part of 6's beard and hair; in B, part of 2's chest and left arm, parts of 3's legs; 4's shoulders, right wrist, and part of the skyphos; 5's right hand, parts of his left knee and calf; parts of 6's calves.

<p>Ours is a small cup of Type B, decorated inside only, in wretched preservation. Within <pb xml:id="iii.20" n="20"/> a palmette border, a winged youth flies, clasping a naked boy. His left hand is on the boy's shoulder, and the boy's right hand holds the back of the other's head. Not far from the boy's back is a design of palmettes. The eye of the winged youth, and his whole face except the chin, are destroyed, and the present state gives a false impression. Parts of the floral, especially those nearest the boy, are repainted, over ancient traces. Relief-contours. Red for the inscription, and for a flower which sets off from the tendril near the boy's head and is visible in the drawing but not in the photograph.</p>

<p>Two other small cups have the same subject inside. One is a fragment in Boston, <rs key="Boston 13.94" type="Vase">Boston 13.94</rs>, from Cervetri. Here the boy wears a himation and holds a lyre, and the attitude of the winged youth is altogether more violent. There is a floral motive near the boy's feet, but a larger one, corresponding to that on our cup, is at the back not of the boy but of the winged youth. The fragmentary inscription is <foreign xml:lang="greek">. . . *T*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, and the name is in all probability Chairestratos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.20.1"><p><title>ARV.1</title> p. 918 no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1570 no. 30.</p></note> The cup is almost contemporary with ours, may be a little earlier: it is close to Douris, and might be by the painter himself.</p>

<p>The other cup with this subject, <rs key="Berlin 2305" type="Vase">Berlin 2305</rs>, is in the manner of Douris, but very late.<note anchored="true" n="iii.20.2"><p>Hartwig pl. 72, 1; Licht ii p. 153: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 297 no. 31; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 450 no. 31.</p></note> The boy holds a lyre as in the Boston fragment. The floral element is reduced to a simple flower.</p>

<p>How is the picture on our cup to be poised? The position of the handles (indicated in Hartwig's drawing) is no guide: but the inscription is symmetrical with respect to the handles, and, on the analogy of other inscriptions like it, should be in the upper part of the tondo. Poising the tondo by means of the inscription would yield an arrangement in which the position of the boy was not far from horizontal, but legs up and head down. This would mean a very empty space in the upper left-hand quarter; which could be mitigated by placing the boy — and the floral motive which runs parallel to him — quite horizontal. The winged youth would be thought of as having caught up the boy and flown away with him, and now to be sinking with him on to a bed of flowers or fern. We have spoken of a 'floral motive', but real plants are intended.</p>

<p>Even so the composition does not seem very happy. It does not follow that the other two pictures are to be poised in the same way: both are difficult, but an upright position appears more natural.</p>

<p>Hartwig has already poised the cup as we are inclined to do; and he named the persons on the three cups: — Zephyros and Hyakinthos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.20.3"><p>For the representations of Hyakinthos see <title>RG</title>. pp. 88-89, <title>ARV.1</title> p. 982, <title>EVP</title>. pp. 49-50 and 142, and Sichtermann in <title>Jb</title>. 71 pp. 97-123. The earliest vase with Hyakinthos is an eye-cup by Oltos of which one fragment is in Erlangen (<title>RG</title>. pp. 88-89; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 36 no. 14; now published in Bruhn <title>Oltos</title> fig. 8, and, rightly poised, by Sichtermann in <title>Jb</title>. 71 p. 104 fig. 8) and other fragments, joining the first, in the Louvre, <rs key="Louvre C 11217" type="Vase">Louvre C 11217</rs> (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 58 no. 45).</p></note> Greifenhagen and Sichtermann have opposed this interpretation, and prefer to think of the winged youth as Eros, of the boy as a mortal. The action of the winged youth in the Boston <emph>fragment</emph> is surprising for Eros: Sichtermann speaks of 'confusion' in the mind of the artist, and I am always disinclined to do that in such cases: but it must be admitted that the action would be rather strange for Zephyros also, and that on several vases from the first half of the fifth century Eros is seen pursuing a boy. In truth the case for Zephyros and Hyakinthos is not very strong, and the names must be followed by a question-mark.</p>

<p>Floral borders are rare in cups by Douris: the four other occurrences are on elaborate masterpieces: <rs key="Vienna 3694" type="Vase">Vienna 3694</rs>, <rs key="Paris, Cab.

<p>The cup must come near the end of the second period.</p>

<p>This is another small cup of Type B, decorated inside only, but of the Hippodamas period. The potter-work is by Python (Bloesch p. 100 no. 36). The underside of the foot has his characteristic form.</p>

<p>The border is that of the Hippodamas period. It makes its first appearance, or one of its first appearances, in the London Theseus cup,<note anchored="true" n="iii.21.1"><p><rs key="London E 48" type="Vase">London E 48</rs>: I, Murray <title>Designs</title> no. 29: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 283 no. 46; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 431 no. 47.</p></note> together with the Douris handle-floral: the 'richer style' has begun. One of the chief features of the new border is the 'false maeander', the maeander in one line that penetrates to the middle of the maze but does not come out again. The 'false maeander' is often used by Douris in his very earliest cups, for instance <rs key="Louvre G 127" type="Vase">Louvre G 127</rs>, and, somewhat later, the small cup in Baltimore;<note anchored="true" n="iii.21.2"><p>Louvre: Hartwig pl. 19, 2 and pl. 20: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 279 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 427 no. 1.

<p>The recent history of the cup is related by F. B. Tarbell in <title>AJA</title>. 1900 p. 183. 'The vase was for many years the property of Thomas Wilson, LL.D., Curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archaeology in the United States National Museum, Washington, D.C. It was found in 1886, between April 4 and 11, in the necropolis on the north-west slope of the <pb xml:id="iii.22" n="22"/> rock on which Orvieto is situated. The discovery was made in the course of excavations conducted by Signor Riccardo Mancini, a well-known explorer of Orvieto, Dr. Wilson being himself present and assisting in the work. The tombs uncovered at the time had been disturbed and destroyed, and the decorated pottery found was all in fragments.' Tarbell refers to <title>Notizie degli Scavi</title> 1886 p. 120, where Mancini briefly records the excavation of a tomb consisting of two chambers, facing south, on the land of G. B. Onori and Don Emilio Puggini, in contrada Cannicella. From 1887 to 1899 the vase was exhibited in the Smithsonian Institution at Washington.</p>

<p>Tarbell notes that the cup was broken into five pieces, and mended, in antiquity. Twenty-one pairs of holes were drilled to receive metal clamps, and the holes joined by channels, 'somewhat as in the cup by the Brygos Painter in the Cabinet des Médailles'.<note anchored="true" n="iii.22.1"><p><rs key="Paris, Cab. Md. 576" type="Vase">Paris, Cab. Méd. 576</rs>: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 247 no. 15; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 371 no. 14.</p></note> The smallest of the five pieces was ruined in the accident, or lost, and was replaced by a fragment from an earlier red-figured cup.<note anchored="true" n="iii.22.2"><p>It is figured, upside down, in <title>AJA</title>. 1954 pl. 61, d: a chignon, and, hanging, a basket.</p></note> There are other examples of this reckless procedure: enough to cite the fragment by Douris used to mend a stamnos by the Copenhagen Painter in the Vatican, and a skyphos from Narce in the Louvre.<note anchored="true" n="iii.22.3"><p><title>JHS</title>. 71 pp. 129-32. Pottier pl. 156, G 567.</p></note> Tarbell adds that subsequently to the repair the cup was broken again, 'probably by being thrown into the fire in connection with the rites of burial. This inference is based on the fact that certain pieces have had their red clay turned to gray in a way believed to be due to fire, while other pieces are unaffected.'</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The cup is of Type B. The shape of the foot suggests that the potter was Python, although the underside is not 'lipped off' as in his other cups.</p>

<p>The cup is late in Douris's middle-Hippodamas-period. Inside, the usual Dourian border; outside, the usual Dourian handle-palmettes. The outer 'rim-clay' — the reserved line at the edge above the pictures — is rather thick and uneven, as it usually is in Douris.</p>

<p>Inside, Dionysos, dressed in long chiton and himation, and wreathed with ivy, stands at an altar, holding out a kantharos in his right hand. Behind, a folding-seat with a cover. Relief-contours both here and outside, and the hair-reserves bordered by a pair of relief-lines. The front hair of Dionysos is scolloped with pairs of arcs in relief, and the back-hair is edged by three relief-lines. The treatment of the folds on the upper part of the himation is formal, in groups of three wavy relief-lines; on the skirt, they are massed in three groups of six lines each. Brown diagonal lines for the folds, not visible in the photograph, on the 'neck-piece' of the chiton for the crisscross on the seat-cover, and for the cyma on the ledge of the altar below the volute-member. Red for the stalk of the wreath, the tags of the seat-cover, the daubs of dried blood on the side of the altar,<note anchored="true" n="iii.22.4"><p>For the custom of daubing the side of the altar with blood see Nilsson <title>Geschichte der griechischen Religion</title> 1 p. 139; for the fire-pan on the altar see <ref target="iii.71" n="U">iii p. 71</ref> (<rs key="Boston 99.539" type="Vase">Boston 99.539</rs>) and Yavis <title>Greek Altars</title> p. 165.</p></note> and the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*O*R*I*S*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>.</p>

<p>The stem and foot of the kantharos are missing, and might perhaps be imagined after the kantharoi on the somewhat later cups by Douris in Cleveland and in Harvard.<note anchored="true" n="iii.22.5"><p><rs key="Cleveland 508.15" type="Vase">Cleveland 508.15</rs>: <title>AJA</title>. 1954 pll. 41-42: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 436 no. 111. <rs key="Harvard 1925.30.129" type="Vase">Harvard 1925.30.129</rs>: <title>CV.</title> Hoppin pll. 9-10: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 286 no. 91; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 436-7 no. 112.</p></note> There are restorations: much of that part of the himation which falls from the shoulder; <pb xml:id="iii.23" n="23"/> most of the slanting folds to right of it; part of the chiton above those folds; some of the vertical folds on the left of the himation; part of the skirt near the ankles. But these restorations do not account for the weakness of the figure, already noticed by Tarbell in the prime publication. This is 'sick-work': Douris was not himself.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The outside is better. A dance of maenads and satyrs: in each half, a trio and a pair, but combined into a quintet. The maenads wear chitons with wing-sleeves (see <ref target="ii.40" n="U">ii p. 40</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8028" type="Vase">Boston 01.8028</rs>), and five of them have himatia of 'Ionic' mode; the sixth has a leopard-skin instead. On A, the maenads bend forward or back, with one arm raised. One satyr seems to be emulating them, the other cuts his own figure, kicking one leg right back, thrusting out both arms with palms down, and pirouetting. His face is frontal; one ear is down, the other up. The underside of the raised foot is shown full length: Douris likes unusual views of feet, although he is not very good at them. The first satyr wears a fawnskin, and his head is tied in the middle of his bald forehead like Priam's on the skyphos by Makron.<note anchored="true" n="iii.23.1"><p>See <ref target="iii.34" n="U">iii p. 34</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.186" type="Vase">Boston 13.186</rs>).</p></note> The other satyr has a full head of hair.</p>

<p>On the other half, the dancing maenads are upright and raise one arm. In the trio on the left, they lunge forward with one foot, and the raised arm has a threatening look, as if about to strike; the satyr makes off, his head turned back. In the pair on the right, the satyr rushes towards the maenad, who turns and raises her arm as if in defence. The attacks, and the resistance, are not serious, only features of the dance. The left-hand satyr holds a thyrsus. He is bald, the other has his hair.</p>

<p>In all six maenads the upper part of the chiton is evenly streaked with vertical relief-lines, for folds and furrows. The skirts have the old system of massed mid-folds falling from the waist, with transverse arcs in the spaces on either side. Four of the women wear a stephane, and in three at least of them the hair is done up in a krobylos. The fifth has a krobylos, but no stephane, only a cord; the sixth, in the middle of B, has shorter hair, with a cord only. The satyrs have simple head-fillets.</p>

<p>Missing, part of the head of the middle maenad on A, part of the beard and left shoulder of the right-hand satyr on B, and some pieces of the palmettes at the handles. The eye on the satyr has suffered: it was originally dot-and-circle like the others, and the present expression is misleading.</p>

<p>Brown for the inner markings on the satyrs' bodies, for hair on their chests, for the inside of the satyr's pelt on A. Red for the hair-cords, and for the inscription on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*P*P*O*L?*A*M*L?*S*K*A*L*O*S?</foreign>. (for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*P*P*O*D*A*M*A*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>) The first sigma is four-stroked, but the lowermost stroke, as Miss Palmer tells me, seems to be due to the painter having accidentally trailed the brush to the right.</p>

<p>Formerly in the possession of Alessandro Castellani. Hartwig p. 620. I, man and youth; A, (men or youths, youth, boy). About 480-470 B.C., by Douris (Hartwig p. 620 no. 4; <title>VA</title>. p. 99; <title>Att. V</title>. p. 208 no. 116; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 287 no. 99; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 437 no. 122).</p>

<p>The fragment belongs to the end of the middle — the Hippodamas — period, on the verge of the Polyphrasmon. At this time Douris slightly modifies his inside border, now grouping the maeander-units in pairs.</p>

<p>Inside, the upper parts of both figures remain. A man, dressed in a himation, which has a dark border, leans on his stick, his lips parted and his left hand grasping his forehead, looking at a youth whose right hand is raised to his hair. The youth, who stands frontal, is probably an athlete, lightly adjusting the wreath on his head. The man shows emotion, and one thinks of Pindar's encomion for Theoxenos: ... <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(\s mh\ po/qw| kumai/netai</foreign> ...</p>

<p>Relief-contours. The hair-reserves are bordered by relief-lines, the forehead-hair with two rows of raised dots, the back-hair with one row. The eye and brow of the man are damaged. Red for his head-fillet, and for the inscription ... <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p><pb xml:id="iii.24" n="24"/> Outside, the right-hand part of the conversation scene on one half remains, male figures in himatia, two groups, with overlapping. A man or youth leaning on his stick, with the right leg frontal and the left crossed behind it; facing him, a youth as it must be; then a man or youth leaning on his stick to right, and a boy standing facing him. Relief contours.</p>

<p>The volute at the right edge of the fragment belongs to the tendril which is often added, after the early Hippodamas period, to the simple form of Dourian palmettes: see, for example, the cup in New York<note anchored="true" n="iii.24.1"><p><rs key="New York 52.11.4" type="Vase">New York 52.11.4</rs>: <title>Bull.

<p>Diameter 0.215, height 0.081. I, woman at laver. About 470 B.C., by Douris (<title>VA</title>. p. 99; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 206 no. 90; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 291 no. 191; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 444 no. 248).</p>

<p>The cup, of Type B, belongs to the fourth — the Polyphrasmon period — of Douris.</p>

<p>The action is the same as in the earlier cup by Douris, no. 128: a woman bends over a shallow basin, which rests on a stand; her hands are in the basin. Beside the stand there is a vessel of the same shape as in the other cup; and again a small goatskin bag hangs on the wall. Behind, the foot of a couch is seen, with a striped cover on it. The costume is chiton, himation, ear-rings, and a saccos ornamented with rows of lotus-buds, a row of crosses, and another of dots. The folds of the chiton are stylized in groups of three on the sleeves, of two on the skirt: compare the chiton of Prometheus on a cup by Douris in the Cabinet des Médailles<note anchored="true" n="iii.24.2"><p><rs key="Paris, Cab.

<p>Relief-contours. The hair over the forehead is edged with relief-lines. Red for the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*E</foreign>. A repainted fracture runs through the end of the coverlet, and another through the mouth of the goatskin.</p>

<p>In his late period Douris sometimes abandons his characteristic border and uses an ordinary sort of maeander-and-cross-square.</p>

<p>The picture is difficult to poise, as the horizontals of the objects run crazily. This is no doubt deliberate, but it is not easy to see what is gained.</p>

<p>The subject is the same as in the earlier cup by Douris, no. 128, except that the person is a woman instead of a naked youth. The basin is again very shallow; the same vessel stands on the ground; and the same goatskin hangs on the wall. On a still later cup by Douris, in Tarquinia, the subject is again the same, except that there is no goatskin; the place of the couch is taken by a table with a basket on it.<note anchored="true" n="iii.24.4"><p><rs key="Tarquinia RC 1116" type="Vase">Tarquinia RC 1116</rs>: <title>Eranos Vindobonensis</title> p. 381; <title>CV</title>. pl. 10, 4: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 291 no. 192; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 445 no. 250.

<p>If we had only these three pictures, we should say that the persons were washing their hands, and that is probably what they are doing. The vessel on the ground — a general-purposes washing-bowl — supplements the high basin, which is all right for cleansing arms and face, but not so suitable for what may be termed sublution.

<p>And the goatskin? in other surroundings one would call it a wineskin, but here it can scarcely be that, and other things are carried in skins besides wine: I do not know if it could contain some cleansing matter or other: perhaps vinegar?</p>

<p>A third occurrence of it in similar surroundings is probably to be found on a cup in the Agora collection at Athens, by an earlier artist, the Painter of the Agora Chairiases, where a naked woman bends over a vessel in which she plunges her hands: the remains on the right of the fragmentary picture are no doubt, as Miss Talcott has seen, one end of a suspended skin.<note anchored="true" n="iii.25.4"><p><title>Hesp.</title> 23 pl. 15, e; <title>Hesp.</title> 24 pl. 32, a: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 176, below, no. 2.</p></note> The skin is certainly present, hanging on the wall, on a white lekythos of the early classic period in the British Museum,<note anchored="true" n="iii.25.5"><p><rs key="London 1909.4-6.3" type="Vase">London 1909.4-6.3</rs>: Herford <title>Handbook of Greek Vase Painting</title> p. 89.</p></note> where a woman bends over a basin, of normal depth, which rests on a stand.

<p>The cup is of Type B. The potter-work is by Python, and the foot has his characteristic form. The outer rim-clay is uneven, as in no. 22.</p>

<p>The cup belongs to the Polyphrasmon period, and is a late work of Douris. The border inside is of the same type as in the last cup. The 'odd man' is north-north-west.</p>

<p><pb xml:id="iii.26" n="26"/>Inside, a very large picture, of four figures. A satyr grasps a maenad, who defends herself. On each side, a satyr capers. The exergue represents rough ground. In the field, six floating flowers, such as are not uncommon in late work of Douris. The maenad, who is very tall, wears a chiton, a fawnskin, and ear-rings. Her hair is rolled up behind by means of a fillet, which is indicated by a single relief-line. The hand on her left shoulder is of course her assailant's: a little awkward that the arm of the right-hand satyr should be extended in the same direction. Relief-contours. Brown for the circles dappling the fawnskin and for the lower edge of the middle satyr's false ribs. The hair-reserves throughout are edged with a relief-line, or a pair of relief-lines. The lower line of the left-hand satyr's chest was omitted by mistake. In the right-hand satyr it was fully drawn, but part of it has disappeared in a fracture. His eye has also suffered; and a repainted fracture passes through the nose, upper lip, and nape of the maenad.</p>

<p>The design is not wholly of Douris's invention. The interior of a much earlier vase, a black-figured stemless cup in Rhodes,<note anchored="true" n="iii.26.1"><p><rs key="Rhodes 12307" type="Vase">Rhodes 12307</rs>: <title>Cl. Rh.</title> 4 p. 266; <title>CV</title> e pl. 15, 2: <title>ABV.</title> p. 213 no. 16.</p></note> which belongs to the Segment Class and is not later than the last quarter of the sixth century, has a composition which, though crudely carried out, resembles ours too closely for coincidence: four figures; in the middle a satyr bending and embracing a very tall maenad, who looks round; of the two flanking satyrs, the left-hand one dances in the same attitude as the corresponding figure on our cup. An old design, then, freshened by Douris.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Outside, one might have expected a Dionysiac subject, but instead we have warriors leaving home: in each half two trios, with much overlapping, even crowding, of figures. On the left of A, a warrior stands between a woman and a man; on the right, a warrior between a woman and a youth. The man, father perhaps, on the right of the first group, near the middle of the half, extending his arm in front of the warrior's shield, is an important figure in the composition. He wears a long chiton, a himation, shoes, and holds a stick. The warrior stands, leaning on his spear, with one leg frontal and the other crossed behind it in a favourite late archaic stance, and turning his head, gazes at the man. He wears chitoniskos, a wrap over both shoulders, an Attic helmet, greaves, and carries a plain shield. The woman facing him is dressed in a chiton with two kolpoi, and a saccos; her right hand holds an oinochoe, the left takes light hold of her garment near the shoulder. The second warrior, in the right-hand group, is clad like the first, and his shield too is plain. The woman facing him, with her head bent and her lips parted, wears chiton and himation, and on her head a stephane; the ends of her long hair are contained in a small bag. She holds a phiale. A youth in a himation looks on, holding his stick by the top. An alabastron is suspended to left of the man's head in the first group, and to right of the head, between the two groups, an aryballos: these help to stress the figure.</p>

<p>In such departure scenes, the two vessels for the libation — phiale and oinochoe — are usually held by the same woman; or else the woman holds the oinochoe, and the departing man the phiale. It is unusual for the two vessels to be divided between two women and two groups.</p>

<p>The six persons on the other half, in two groups of three each, are all men in himatia, with sticks. The left-hand one wears shoes. The right-hand one turns his head away from his companions, and his attitude and gesture connect this half of the cup with the other: the scene is the same. A pair of sandals hangs in the field to left of the third man's head, another, fragmentary, to right of it; a strigil, between the first man and the second; and, between the fifth and the sixth, an aryballos of the same type as on A. Here it is plain that the projection to left of the mouth is that form of handle or lug (serving to take a cord) which is common in actual aryballoi.<note anchored="true" n="iii.26.2"><p>See <title>BSA.</title> 29 pp. 187-216.</p></note> The aryballoi on our cup, with their single handle, tall body, and broad flat bottom, are recognizably like the vase in Athens which was painted by Douris, and, as the signature states, fashioned by him as well.<note anchored="true" n="iii.26.3"><p><rs key="Athens 15375" type="Vase">Athens 15375</rs>: <title>Anz</title>. 1928 p. 571; <title>Delt</title>. 1927-8 pll. 4-5, suppl. plate, and pp. 94 and 102; part, Richter and Milne fig. 106; Greifenhagen <title>Eroten</title> p. 59: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 293 no. 210; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 447 no. 274.</p></note> It is earlier than our cup, belongs to the Hippodamas period, but Douris's idea of an aryballos has not changed.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p><pb xml:id="iii.27" n="27"/>A third aryballos is represented to left of the left-hand man's arm, but the painter forgot to add the mouth, nor is there trace of it in the preliminary sketch.</p>

<p>The design of the handle-palmettes is the same as in the Hippodamas period, only somewhat more ornate: the middle palmette is capped by a symmetrical double-volute; the lateral palmettes are also capped by tendrils but the volutes are replaced by flowers; another tendril, ending in a flower, springs from the lower edge of the lateral palmettes; and there are buds in all the axils. A slight elaboration of the Hippodamas palmettes is regular in the Polyphrasmon period of the artist; the flower-terminals are rare, but recur in the Leipsic cup (<rs key="Leipsic T 550" type="Vase">Leipsic T 550</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.27.1"><p>Hartwig pp. 661-2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 288 no. 116; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 438 no. 139.</p></note></p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown lines on the sleeve of one woman on A, and for minor markings on the bodies of the men. The eye of the left-hand woman on A is damaged, the mouth of the right-hand warrior, the beard of the fifth man on B.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type C, in which it is hard to distinguish one potter from another.

The stem is not so thick as usual.</p>

<p>The decoration is inside only. Within a reserved circle, and upon an exergue, a satyr kneels or squats, supporting himself with his left hand and extending his right arm, the head raised and the mouth open. In front of him is a large kantharos on a block, and it is probably in the satyr's mind: he may be about to perform one of those 'tricks with cups' (see on no. 126), but the action is not easy to explain. The hands are poor. Two large flowers float in the field. Relief-contours. The lower edge of the hair-reserve is bounded by a relief-line. Brown for the minor details of the body. For the wriggly brown line running down from the navel compare no. 129, and the Oedipus cup in the Vatican.<note anchored="true" n="iii.27.3"><p>Hartwig pl. 73; <title>JHS</title>. 57 pl. 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 296 no. 12; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 451, iii no. 1.</p></note> Here the wriggle continues from the navel to the pit of the stomach.

Buschor <title>Griechische Vasen</title> p. 172 fig. 194; the shoulder, <title>AJA</title>. 1946 p. 104 fig. 10, 2 (Dinsmoor); the shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 217 no. 172. Jumper. About 490-480 B.C., by Douris (<title>VA</title>. p. 98, <title>Att. V</title>. p. 209 no. 132; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 293 no. 206, <title>ARV.2</title>, p. 447 no. 270).</p>

<p>Standard shape of full-size red-figured lekythoi. As to details, the foot has the minority form that long subsists side by side with the torus and the lipped torus; the neck is shortish; the mouth is shortish, and the incurve towards the top is still very faint, though not quite absent as in Caskey's drawing. On the shoulder, tongue-pattern, and a neat design of four red-figure palmettes on their sides, running, and terminating in a flower (<title>AJA</title>. 1946 p. 104 fig. 10, 2). Tongue-pattern soon becomes much less common, on the shoulders of red-figured lekythoi, than egg-pattern; but it is frequent in earlier pieces. Red-figure palmettes of this type are quite rare on lekythoi. There are half a dozen other examples,<note anchored="true" n="iii.27.4"><p>Four were put together by Miss Haspels (<title>ABL.</title> pp. 162 and 262), and two added in <title>ABV.</title> p. 524.</p></note> but the drawing of the palmettes is not the same as here.</p>

<p><pb xml:id="iii.28" n="28"/>The band above the picture is decorated with net-pattern, long a favourite in this place. The lower border of the band has an uneven edge which recalls the outer rim-clay on cups of Douris (<ref target="iii.22" n="U">iii p. 22</ref>; <rs key="Boston 00.499" type="Vase">Boston 00.499</rs>). Below the figure, Douris's 'false maeander', with cross-squares: but not alternating, and the drawing of the cross-squares not very characteristically his.</p>

<p>The athlete has a halter in each hand, and is going to jump, <foreign xml:lang="greek">a(lou/menos ei)=si</foreign> in the pleasant anticipation of the viewer's question on the psykter by Oltos in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.28.1"><p><rs key="New York 10.210.18" type="Vase">New York 10.210.18</rs>: Richter and Hall pl. 4: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 35 no. 6; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 54 no. 7.</p></note> On the right, a sponge and an aryballos, suspended. They are damaged; and the youth's buttocks, with part of his right thigh, and most of his right hand, are restored. Relief-contours. The hair-reserve is bordered by a pair of relief lines. There are no brown inner markings, and neither collar-bone nor nipple is indicated. The head-fillet is in red, and so is the inscription on the right, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*X*A*I[*R]*E*S*T*R[*A*T]*O*S</foreign> and below it <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, both curving downwards.</p>

<p>The vase belongs to the later part of the Chairestratos period. The figure is a replica of one on a Chairestratos cup, signed by Douris, in the Basle market,<note anchored="true" n="iii.28.2"><p>Schefold <title>Meisterwerke</title> p. 193: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 430 no. 31.</p></note> a good example of the 'bare' decoration described above.</p>

<p>The shape is again standard, and the foot has the same form as in no. 134, though less flaring. The neck is a little longer, and the incurve of the mouth more pronounced. The decoration is of the same 'bare' type as in many lekythoi already described (see <ref target="ii.41" n="U">ii p. 41</ref>; <rs key="Boston 00.341" type="Vase">Boston 00.341</rs>): the greater part of the shoulder black, and no pattern above the picture. Tongue-pattern at the top of the shoulder, but not of the same type as in no. 134. Below the figure, a band of maeander, with a large cross-square in the middle: not characteristically Dourian.</p>

<p>A youth, his cloak laid over one shoulder, squats, <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)kla/zei</foreign>, holding lyre and plectrum, his left hand at the strings. He leans back, and looks up, with lips parted, about to sing or play. The drawing is not very careful, but there is feeling in the figure. The attitude is unusual for a lyre-player: nearest, the lyre-player on the interior of an early red-figure cup in Florence, <rs key="Florence PD 274" type="Vase">Florence PD 274</rs>, but he does not lean back. A frontalized version of the attitude is given by the satyr musician on an archaic Etruscan scarab in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.28.3"><p><title>Bull.

<p>Relief-contours. Brown inner markings. Brown for the thick forehead hair, for the whisker, and for a line indicating the moustache (rather than the cheek). There is a little repainting at the lower end of the cloak.

<p>Diameter 0.235. From the Bourguignon collection, Naples. Hartwig pl. 26. I, reveller and boy. A-B, men and youths courting boys and a youth. About 500-495 B.C.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B. The foot and one handle are missing.</p>

<p>Inside, an old man moves to right, leaning back, holding a lyre and singing. He wears a cloak, boots, and a wreath of large leaves. The back of the head is partly modern. He is preceded by a small boy, who looks round; a cloak hangs over his left arm and he holds a stick over his left shoulder. The stick is probably his master's. Another stick is seen on the left of the picture leaning. The left heel of the boy is present, and part of his right foot. Relief-contours. The beard is relief-contoured; the ends of the beard are in relief-lines, and so is the moustache. The backs of the boots are browned, where the hair has been left on the leather. The inscription on the exergue, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*E*N*O*D*O*T*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, is in dark brown. Red for the wreath and for the inscription, to right of the mouth, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*P*A*N*I*O*N*I*E*N</foreign>, which must be what the reveller is singing. It does not seem to be nonsense, and several attempts have been made to explain it: my own will be found in <title>AJA</title>. 1927 pp. 348-9 no. 9 and 1929 p. 364 no. 8.</p>

<p>Outside, a courting scene: two groups in each half. On the right of A, a man, leaning on his stick, gives advice to a boy who stands facing him. Both wear the himation, and are seen partly from behind. Pieces of the himatia are modern, and the right arm of the boy, with part of his back. Behind the boy, and in the middle of the picture, a naked youth stands with both legs frontal, his head turned towards the pair, looking at them, and his body leaning a little in the same direction. His left arm hangs down at his side, with the back of the hand against the thigh, and his right forearm is passed behind his back with the thumb up and the fingers spread out, holding the left arm near the elbow. This position of the arms is seldom depicted. Hartwig noted that it occurred in the figure of a ball-player on an Attic grave-relief in Athens,<note anchored="true" n="iii.29.1"><p><title>BCH.</title> 1883 pl. 19; Conze pl. 203 no. 1046.</p></note> where there is a special reason for the position, just as there is in the figure of Ajax on an Etruscan scarab in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.29.2"><p><title>EVP.</title> p. 139 and pl. 32, 7.</p></note> (A third occurrence, in a picture of St. Jerome by Rubens, formerly in Sanssouci, where a putto is teasing the holy man's tame lion, is not helpful).<note anchored="true" n="iii.29.3"><p><title>Burlington Magazine</title> Dec. 1953 p. 393.</p></note> On the left of the picture, a youth, his left hand resting on his hip and holding the top of his stick, offers a pomegranate to a boy. Both wear himatia; the boy's is drawn up tightly over the back of his head, but he pokes his right hand out at the neck; his left lifts the himation. The youth's dog, a Maltese, is behind him, under the handle. To left of his left arm, sponge, strigil, and flat-bottomed aryballos hang from a thong.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>B. On the left of the other half, a man with a wrap over his shoulders, holds a hare by ears and hind-legs, offering it to a naked youth, who takes it by one fore-leg. Beside the youth is a marten (<foreign xml:lang="greek">galh=</foreign>), an animal which is not infrequently mentioned in literature but not often represented.<note anchored="true" n="iii.29.4"><p>For other pictures of it see <ref target="ii.2" n="U">ii p. 2</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.221" type="Vase">Boston 10.221</rs>). See also Llewellyn Brown <title>The Etruscan Lion</title> p. 176. On a white-ground alabastron in New York (<rs key="New York 21.139.27" type="Vase">New York 21.139.27</rs>: two archers) one of the two animals is a leopard-cub, the other may be a marten. I cannot believe that the animal on the Poulopoulos relief in Athens is a marten (Schipper in <title>Archaeology</title> 5, 1952, pp. 25-29).</p></note> The head of the hare (except the ears) is modern, the youth's right forearm, and a little of his left hand. On the right of the picture a youth stands with one leg frontal, leaning on the stick propped under his left armpit and holding a hare behind him, by the ears, in his right hand. He is not yet handing it over to the boy who stands facing him, in much the same attitude as the boy in the left-hand group on A, but with a more bashful appearance. His himation is draped over the back of the head; the youth's is thrown carelessly over right shoulder and left arm. His right hand is modern, also the hare's ears with the top of its head.</p>

<p>There may have been an animal or something else under the handle to left of this half, but the piece is missing.</p>

<p>Relief-contours, except for the lips. 'There is much use of brown lines for the minor details of the bodies; but the furrows on the frontal feet, and the horizontal creases above them, are in relief-lines. The boy on B, the youth on A, and the boy in the left-<pb xml:id="iii.30" n="30"/> hand group, are fair-haired. A scumbling of brown is used for the fur of the hares; brown lines for the coat of the dog and the tail of the marten, brown dots for the holes of the sponge. Red for the head-fillets, the dog's collar, and the inscriptions, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S</foreign> on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O[*P*A]*I*S</foreign> on B. The restorations are clear from Hartwig's drawing.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The ages of the persons are distinguished. There are two men, with beards, one of whom, he on the right of A, seems a more serious character than the other. The two courting youths have whiskers. The youth in the left-hand group on B is full-grown or nearly, but has no whisker. The naked youth on A is younger. Younger still, the two boys wrapped in their himatia. The youngest is the boy receiving advice in the right-hand group on A.</p>

<p>The drawing is laboured and affected, but original and not inexpressive. It has something in common with the earliest phase of Douris.<note anchored="true" n="iii.30.1"><p>So already <title>Att.

<p>Outside, Peleus and Thetis. Rather before 490 B.C., by Makron. (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 302 no. 14; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 460 no. 16).</p>

<p>Seven fragments, making up into three, give a small part of the outside picture. On the largest fragment, (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a</foreign>), Nereus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">[*N]*E*R*E*U*S</foreign>), with a long white beard, sits to right, holding a sceptre in his left hand. A Nereid runs towards him, extending her right arm, and holding a dolphin in her left hand. She wears chiton, himation of 'Ionic' mode, necklace. On the right, thigh and bare knee of another Nereid, also running towards Nereus. Fragment (<foreign xml:lang="greek">b</foreign>) gives the middle of Nereus, seen to be sitting on a chair, wearing chiton as well as himation, and holding a dolphin in his right hand. On the left, front of the himation of a third Nereid, moving to right. Fragment (<foreign xml:lang="greek">g</foreign>) has part of a fourth Nereid, running to right, the left arm outstretched. She wears a chiton, with a short kolpos and a flounce, and over it, shawl-wise, a himation. Relief-lines indicate the stripe near the lower edge of the flounce.</p>

<p>The subject of the picture was probably Peleus struggling with Thetis, while her sisters flee to their father Nereus: compare, for example, two cups in London, <rs key="London E 9" type="Vase">London E 9</rs> by the Euergides Painter, <rs key="London E 73" type="Vase">London E 73</rs> by the Kleophrades Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.30.3"><p>Gerhard <title>AV.</title> pl. 178-9, below: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 60 no. 10; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 89 no. 13. <title>J.

<p>The contours are in relief-lines, so are the ends of the beard. The dots of the necklace are in relief. Brown lines for the inner markings on the arm and hand of Nereus, for the wrinkles on the dolphin's head, for the minor details of the sleeves, for the 'interfolds' of the chitons. These 'interfolds' — really crinkles or furrows in the material, like the lines on the sleeves — are not very common in Makron, but recur, for instance, on a cup in the Faina collection, on a cup-fragment in Brunswick, and on a cup in Munich.<note anchored="true" n="iii.30.6"><p><rs key="Munich Faina 36" type="Vase">Munich Faina 36</rs>: phot.

A, satyrs assaulting a sleeping nymph; B, similar. About 490 B.C., by Makron, early (<title>VA</title>. p. 102; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 303 no. 26; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 461 no. 36).</p>

<p>Inside. A man, who wears shoes, and a cloak over both arms, walks with a large cup in his right hand, a stick in his left, and a basket at his left shoulder. Besides the damage visible in the photograph, the right hand has suffered; a thin line slanting from the stick towards the hip is not original, nor is a line that might seem to represent the mouth. Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details, not seen in the reproduction, of the body. Red for the wreath, for the tags hanging from the feet of the basket and from the upper corner of it, and for the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A[*L*O]*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Outside. On A the nymph is asleep on a rock under a tree, with her right hand behind her head in the attitude of many sleepers on vases, her left hand still grasping her thyrsus, and her mouth open. She wears a chiton, with kolpos, and a necklace. Missing, the upper part of the right-hand satyr's head and the tip of his tail. On B, the situation is similar but the nymph has woken up and looks round. She wears ear-rings as well as a necklace. Missing, the back of the left-hand satyr, the end of the nymph's thyrsus and the crown of her head. Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details of the satyr's body, which do not appear in the photographs, also for the crinkle of the kolpoi. Red for the wreaths of the satyrs, the hair-cords of the nymphs, the girdle on B, the leaves of the tree.</p>

<p>The subjects outside are the same as on the much later oinochoe published on Plate LXIV above. A list of the many vases with satyrs attacking sleeping nymphs is given in the commentary on the oinochoe.<note anchored="true" n="iii.31.1"><p><ref target="ii.96" n="U">ii pp. 96-99 and 103</ref> (Addenda to Part II), where our cup is no. 10 on p. 96 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8085" type="Vase">Boston 01.8085</rs>).</p></note></p>

<p>This is another example of the 'bare' decoration described above (<ref target="iii.18" n="U">iii p. 18</ref>; <rs key="Boston 00.338" type="Vase">Boston 00.338</rs>): no floral or other motive at the handles, and the borders a simple reserved line. Here a single figure inside, and, outside, three large figures on each half. To speak very broadly, the drawing has the same general character as in such early Panaetian cups as are reproduced in Plate XXXIX, and the pictures outside may be compared with the grander versions of the same subject by the Panaitios Painter in Baltimore, Florence, and the Louvre.<note anchored="true" n="iii.31.2"><p><ref target="ii.96" n="U">ii p. 96</ref> nos. 7-9 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 01.8085" type="Vase">Boston 01.8085</rs>); the Florence cup is now republished, with the new fragments, in <title>CV</title>. pl. 87. <title>ARV.2</title> p. 320 nos. 10, 12, and 11.</p></note> Our cup is good too.

<p>Diameter 0.281. The foot is missing. Formerly in the possession of the Roman dealer Basseggio, later in the collection of Dr. W. S. Bigelow, who presented it to the Museum. Gerhard <title>A.V.</title> pl. 57, 3-4; Edward Robinson p. 144; drawing in the Berlin Apparatus, xxi. 97. 2. I, Dionysos and a satyr. About 490 B.C. or not long after, by Makron (Hartwig p. 299; <title>VA</title>. p. 103 no. 32; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 214 no. 42; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 313 no. 219; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 478 no. 309).</p>

<p>This is a large cup to be decorated inside only.</p>

<p>The maeander is of the type that Makron nearly always uses after his very earliest period.</p>

<p>V-shaped designs are commoner in the Brygos Painter than in Makron, but Makron has several. Dionysos holds a kantharos and a branch of ivy, and a small satyr, oinochoe <pb xml:id="iii.32" n="32"/> in hand, offers to serve him with wine. The god wears a long chiton, a himation, an ivy-wreath; the satyr is also wreathed with ivy, and wears boots with flaps. His long hair is tied near the ends, and stands up stiff over the forehead. Restored, part of his right arm, his right foot, left heel, and the tip of his tail with the neighbouring stretch of the border; also part of the little finger of the god's right hand.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. The beards are edged with relief-lines, and there is much relief detail in the lower parts of the hair. No brown inner markings. Red is used for the stalk of the god's wreath, for the wreath of the satyr, for the leaves of the ivy-branch, and for the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Makron's style is not yet fully developed in this cup, and the drawing for some reason is rather listless. A very similar figure of Dionysos, with a small satyr beside him, is on a cup by Makron in Brussels, and is a little freer.<note anchored="true" n="iii.32.1"><p><rs key="Brussels R 247" type="Vase">Brussels R 247</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 11, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 303 no. 31; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 462 no. 41.</p></note> The picture inside a cup in Munich, although the subject is different, resembles ours in style.<note anchored="true" n="iii.32.2"><p><rs key="Munich 2655" type="Vase">Munich 2655</rs>: <title>WV</title>.

<p>A small particular in the dress is a favourite with Makron and we shall notice it in other vases of his: the tiny bag-like object at the right shoulder. It is part of the same device as the 'neck-piece' of the chiton. A draw-cord was threaded through the neck-piece to tighten the garment at the neck, and the ends of the neck-piece wound up into a little bunch. So also in nos. 140 and 141.</p>

<p>A, Paris leading Helen away; B, Menelaos attacking Helen. About 490-480 B.C., by Makron (<title>VA</title>. pp. 101-2 no. 1; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 211 no. 3; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 301 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 458 no. 1).</p>

<p>The vase was discovered on the 22nd of March 1879 during Marchese Marcello Spinelli's excavations in the cemetery of Suessula. The cemetery lies about two kilometres west-south-west of the station of Cancello (on the road to Nola), ten minutes' walk from the ruins of Suessula. Ferdinand von Duhn gave an account of the circumstances in <title>Bullettino</title> 1879 pp. 147-53, together with a careful and accurate description of the vase itself. The tomb excavated on that day contained four slight vases which according to Duhn were probably Attic, and which appear from the description to have been <pb xml:id="iii.33" n="33"/> Attic of the later fifth century. The Makron skyphos was not found in the tomb but beside it, as if leaning against it. Such vases were not infrequent in the cemetery: the vases found outside the tomb had been used, it was thought in the funeral rites, but after the tomb had been closed. One of them is identifiable: it is a small pelike, with two youths and a woman on the front, and two youths on the back, which has now passed from the Spinelli collection, where it bore the number 2297, to the Naples Museum: it is by the Eretria Painter, and the date is about 430 B.C.<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.1"><p><title>ARV.2</title> p. 1250 no. 31.</p></note> The Makron vase contained ashes, probably of an animal, three small mugs of local fabric, and a small black skyphos. Owing to the fatty nature of the ashes the lower part of the vase was well preserved while the upper part had been affected by the lime in the soil. The colour of the two parts is also different, the upper pale, the lower a warm red. The Makron skyphos is evidently earlier than the vases found in the tomb itself, and was doubtless an old family possession.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Makron has left three skyphoi, all bearing the signature of the potter Hieron, and all found in Campania; besides a fragment of a fourth, found at Locri.<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.2"><p><rs key="Reggio 4062" type="Vase">Reggio 4062</rs>: see <title>ARV.2</title> p. 459 no. 3 bis.</p></note> The skyphos in the Louvre<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.3"><p><rs key="Louvre G 146" type="Vase">Louvre G 146</rs>: <title>Mon.</title> 6-7 pl. 19, whence Hoppin ii p. 81; Pottier pl. 118; A, phot.

The London skyphos<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.4"><p><rs key="London E 140" type="Vase">London E 140</rs>: FR. pl. 161 and iii p. 259; <title>CV</title>. pl. 28, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 301 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 459 no. 3.</p></note> has the usual horizontal handles and black foot, is in fact normal. Its shape has been analysed by Hambidge<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.5"><p><title>The Diagonal</title> 1 pp. 114-15.</p></note>: the bowl ratio (bowl, without handles, to height) is 1.236, which is very common in skyphoi. Measurements are not available for the Louvre skyphos: those given by Pottier and Hoppin can hardly be exact, since they make the breadth of the bowl less than the height. The Boston skyphos is unusually broad for its height, and the wall is strongly curved. It has been analysed by Caskey in Hambidge's <title>Dynamic Symmetry</title> p. 109, above, and in <title>G</title>. p. 158: he finds it 'abnormal in its breadth, in the excessive diminution, and in its contours. The shape seems to have been chosen with a view to affording a more advantageous field for the pictorial composition — a frieze of numerous large, closely spaced figures.'</p>

<p>The massive handles are reserved within. The resting-surface of the foot is curved; the slanting surface between the resting-surface and the underside of the bowl, is convex, and black; the underside of the bowl is reserved except for a dot within two tiny circles and two large ones, much as in the Vienna skyphos by the Brygos Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.33.6"><p><title>CV</title>. pl. 35, 2.</p></note></p>

<p>The theme of the vase is Helen. At two crises in her life. On one side, she follows Paris; on the other, after Troy taken, she flees from Menelaos. Between these two moments there has been the Trojan War. In both crises there is divine intervention. In the first crisis, Aphrodite encourages Helen; in the second, she rescues her.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>If one compares this skyphos, in its general aspect, with others, one sees that it is a very light-coloured vase. The five large thick-set figures in each picture, with their ample drapery, are massed together, so that little of the black background shows through. Besides, the pictures reach very far down on the vase, so that there is only a thin band of black between the lower border and the foot. The side of the foot itself, which is nearly always black in skyphoi, is here reserved, left in the colour of the clay. Laterally, the outer figures <pb xml:id="iii.34" n="34"/> extend so far that parts of them are cut off by the handles. There is a band of maeander above the pictures as well as the more ordinary band below them, again a light-coloured element. A subsidiary figure fills most of the space below each handle, the heads of these figures projecting into the reserved area between the handle-roots. In one of the pictures a small sixth figure, Eros, is set in the spandril between the heads of the two chief figures, filling that gap too. In both pictures, most of the usual black accents within the figures — black hair, black for the coloured part of the eye, black for the shield-devices — are missing: the eyes are light — dot-and-circle — , and nearly all the people are fair-haired. This packing of the field contributes to a comparative richness of effect which is rare in the drawing of the late archaic period.</p>

<p>Another famous skyphos of the same period, the Achilles and Priam by the Brygos Painter in Vienna,<note anchored="true" n="iii.34.1"><p><rs key="Vienna 3710" type="Vase">Vienna 3710</rs> (ex Vienna, Oest. Mus. 328): FR. pl. 84; <title>CV</title>. pll. 35-37: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 253 no. 129; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 380 no. 171.</p></note> is treated on the same principle. There the quietness of the scene, all uprights and horizontals, contrasts not only with renderings of the subject by earlier painters, in which Priam makes a sudden rush forward without thought of his dignity, but also with the almost violent animation that we expect from the Brygos Painter. The artist has chosen a sort of composition that suits the solid, thick-walled, stable, almost quadrangular, block-like vessel; or chosen a shape of vase that suited his composition; or rather, shape and composition formed a unity in his mind. The Vienna skyphos, too, is an uncommonly light-coloured vase: the black background has been cut down by packing the field with figures, by placing a strip of maeander above the picture as well as below, by extending the picture far down and leaving little black space between it and the foot, and by reserving the side of the foot instead of painting it black.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>We have spoken of the two figures, one under each handle, as subsidiary. They are not seen when you look at either picture straight on. In subject they are connected, though not very closely, one with the first picture, the other with the second; in composition they are virtually separated from them, or form codas only. They are primarily handle-figures. We deal with them before turning to the chief scenes.</p>

<p>Under one handle sits Priam (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*R*I*A*M*O*S</foreign>, retr.); looking towards Menelaos and Helen. He is bald, and what hair he has is fair — old men are often given fair hair on vases. It is trained forward and tied over the middle of the forehead, as in Priam on an earlier vase, the amphora by Euthymides in Munich,<note anchored="true" n="iii.34.2"><p><rs key="Munich 2307" type="Vase">Munich 2307</rs>: FR. pl. 14; <title>CV</title>. pl. 167. See also <ref target="iii.23" n="U">iii p. 23</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.208" type="Vase">Boston 10.208</rs>).</p></note> and in the old man on our no. 155. The beard is black. He holds a staff with T-shaped head in the right hand; the gesture of the left hand shows apprehension. The costume is a long chiton and a himation. The seat is a folding-chair, with feet that end, as often, in the form of lion's paws. The cover has a chequer pattern. Priam, as was said, is primarily a handle-figure, but actually the upright stick and the almost upright shanks come into the field of vision in the great picture and help to frame it, answering, at one edge of it, to the upright figure with upright staff on the extreme left, and redressing the balance thrown out by the diagonal figure, in strong movement, of Menelaos.</p>

<p>The figure under the other handle is a young boy in a himation, who takes a step forward and raises one hand. A fillet passes twice round his head. The hair is black, and the curling forehead-hair is in raised black dots on a black ground. The right thumb and forefinger are damaged. The artist has not named him, but certainly thought of him as Helen's son. Helen's fault was the greater, in that she abandoned not only her husband but her young child. Sappho speaks of Helen leaving her child, and so does Alcaeus. One cannot tell whether these poets had a son in mind, or a daughter. In the <title>Iliad</title> it is a daughter, and in the <title>Odyssey</title> she is named, Hermione. Two children, however, were mentioned in a Hesiodic poem: Hermione, and Nikostratos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.34.3"><p><bibl>Sappho 16, 10</bibl>; <bibl>Alcaeus 283, 6</bibl>. <bibl>Hesiod fr. 131</bibl>. Robert <title>Bild und Lied</title> pp. 54-56 and <title>Heldensage</title> pp. 1061-2.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The upper parts of both heads, Priam's and the boy's, are drawn in outline against the handle-reserve. This is a rare trait that recurs in two of Makron's cups.<note anchored="true" n="iii.34.4"><p><rs key="New York 20.246" type="Vase">New York 20.246</rs> (Richter and Hall pl. 50, 53 and pll. 53-54). <rs key="Gotha 49" type="Vase">Gotha 49</rs>: Elisabeth Rohde <title>Kleinkunst</title> pp. 64-65 figs. 9-10.</p></note></p>

<p>We now turn to the two scenes. There are many older pictures of the meeting between <pb xml:id="iii.35" n="35"/> Helen and Menelaos at Troy, though differently conceived; but the earliest certain representations of the other episode, Paris leading Helen away, are by Makron: on this skyphos, and on the cup in Berlin.<note anchored="true" n="iii.35.1"><p><rs key="Berlin 2291" type="Vase">Berlin 2291</rs>: <title>WV</title>.

<p>A. Paris and Helen. The rectangular composition may be looked at from two points of view. First: a trio, the three chief persons, Paris, Helen, Aphrodite, forming almost a square, is increased to an oblong by two supporting persons, Aeneas and Peitho; or, second, the design is composed of two squares: a packed, solid one, feminine, static, on the right, and an open, masculine, dynamic one on the left. There is a contrast between the bold stride and determined action of Paris, and the hesitation of the middle figure, Helen, moving with difficulty, the head bent and the diaphragm drawn in. The right hand, firmly grasped by Paris, is nerveless; the left is the hand of one treading delicately a dangerous path. Not so the Helen of Aeschylus, who <foreign xml:lang="greek">beba/kei r(i/mfa dia\ pula=n</foreign>.</p>

<p>Helen (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E*L*E*N*E</foreign>) wears a chiton with two flounces, one ending at the waist, the other at the upper part of the thighs, below which the ends of the girdle are seen; besides the chiton, a himation draped over the back of the head, a stephane, and ear-rings. There may have been a necklace — the surface is damaged at the place; the face too has suffered: some of the damaged lines are still distinguishable, but not all. The chiton, and all the other chitons, have a thin horizontal stripe, rendered by a relief-line, at mid-calf. The corner of the himation seen at the left calf has the curved form which is characteristic of Makron and gives a swing to the garment even at the end. The hair is fair, but over the forehead the curls are rendered by raised black dots — or rather bubbles — on a light ground. Here and elsewhere many of these bubbles have burst. The left heel is raised a little farther from the border than in Aphrodite and Peitho.</p>

<p>Eros (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*O*S</foreign>), flying round in front of Helen, turns and touches her head: the precise action is not clear: he holds a small round object, done in red, in his right hand, possibly a jewel for the stephane. The left leg is in three-quarter view. The fair hair has a wreath of small round leaves. The forehead-hair is in raised black dots on a light ground. The cornea is black. Forehead, eye, and knees are damaged.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Aphrodite (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*F*R*O*D*I*T*E</foreign> retr.) stands behind Helen, bending a little forward, her arms extended to Helen's head, lightly adjusting the himation round it. She wears a chiton, a himation over both shoulders, ear-rings, and on her head a veil, which is bound at ear-level by a cross-piece and fastened in front to a stephane. The forehead-hair is like Helen's.</p>

<p>The group of Aphrodite, Helen, and Paris has been compared to those of bride's mother, bride, and bridegroom in the many pictures of weddings on loutrophoroi and other vases: most of these are later than the skyphos, but a lost vase, formerly in Basseggio's possession, is of nearly the same period and has a somewhat similar group.<note anchored="true" n="iii.35.2"><p><title>Mon</title>. 8 pl. 35.</p></note> Aphrodite, then, is like the mother who sets her daughter on her way, speeds her forth to a new life. In the wedding pictures the direction is rightward, not leftward as in the skyphos and in Makron's other version of the subject, on his cup in Berlin. Rightward, generally speaking, is the 'towards' direction; leftward, the 'away' direction. The wedding-pictures often add the spandril-Eros to the three figures.</p>

<p>Peitho (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*E*I*Q*O</foreign>), constantly associated with Aphrodite both in poetry and in picture, stands behind the goddess, holding up a flower (clearer in the side-view photograph than in the front-view). Her chiton is like Helen's, her himation like Aphrodite's. She wears a necklace as well as ear-rings. Her fair hair is dressed krobylos-wise, with a scarf tied loosely round it.</p>

<p>Paris (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*L*E*X*S*A*N*D*R*O*S</foreign> retr.) strides quickly, looking back, the head slightly bent, his shield in his right hand, his left grasping Helen's wrist. He wears a chitoniskos with a flounce, a full-length himation over both shoulders, sandals, and a Corinthian helmet; the crest and crest-holder are rendered with particular attention. The hair is fair; with rows of raised black dots, it seems, at the ends.</p>

<p>Paris is preceded by Aeneas (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*N*E*A[*S]</foreign>), son of Aphrodite, and his companion for this expedition, in much the same attitude as Paris, but the stride less forcible. He wears <pb xml:id="iii.36" n="36"/> a chitoniskos, a himation arranged somewhat like a chlamys, sandals, and a petasos slung round his neck. The ends of the long hair are brought round to the forehead, and the front half of the hair combed down so as to conceal them; a cord is wound twice round the head, the ends hanging down at the nape. It is the same coiffure, or nearly, as in the fair-haired youth from the Acropolis and many other figures of the late archaic period and the early classic. Over his right shoulder Aeneas carries a pair of spears, and on his left arm a shield, not foreshortened. The device is, on a black base, a lion, not, as is more usual, in silhouette, but in outline, filled in (except the head) with a wash of diluted glaze-paint, a tawny colour. The painter's signature is on the right.</p>

<p>B. Menelaos and Helen. There are many older representations, as was said already, of the meeting of Menelaos and Helen at Troy — 'the Recovery of Helen' — , but differently conceived.<note anchored="true" n="iii.36.1"><p>See Kunze <title>Archaische Schildbänder</title> pp. 163-7.</p></note> Ours is the earliest in which Helen is attacked by Menelaos and saved by Aphrodite: but very little later, if at all, a cup in Tarquinia, which is in the manner of the Brygos Painter and close to the Foundry Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.36.2"><p><rs key="Tarquinia RC 5291" type="Vase">Tarquinia RC 5291</rs>: <title>Mon</title>. 11 pl. 20; Ghali-Kahil <title>H</title>. pl. 56, 2; <title>CV</title>. pl. 18: <title>ARV.1</title> pp. 256-7; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 405 no. 1.</p></note></p>

<p>Makron's second design may be analysed, like the first, in two ways. (1) A trio, the three chief actors, Menelaos, Helen, Aphrodite, forms the core of the design, which is augmented, on the left, by two spectators, Kriseus and Kriseis. (2) A dense mass in the middle, feminine, Kriseis, Aphrodite, Helen, is flanked by two more open figures, male, Kriseus and Menelaos.</p>

<p>On the right, Menelaos (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*E*N*E*L*E*O*S</foreign>), head lowered, rushes at Helen, drawing his sword. He is in full armour, wears chitoniskos, leather corslet, greaves, shield; and helmet of Attic type with chequered caul, nasal, frontlet imitating curls of hair, scaled nape-piece, hinged cheekpiece. The chequers on the caul are the same as on the cover of Priam's chair: the bronze helmet has a textile cover glued to it against the heat of the sun on the metal. The knees of the greaves, as often, are ornamented with gorgoneia.<note anchored="true" n="iii.36.3"><p>See <title>Dev</title>. pp. 69 and 113.</p></note> A pad with slashed edge is tied round the ankle against chafing by the greave. The corslet is strengthened with metal scales, and the shoulder-flap charged with a star. The shield, as before, is unforeshortened, a full round. The device is, on a black base with reserved edges, a bull charging, head down. This time the device is black, which, with the subject, adds to the menace of the bearer's figure.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Helen (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*E*L*E*N*E</foreign>), fleeing, turns, and looks at Menelaos: he stops, and the sword will not be drawn. On later vases the sword, drawn, falls from his hand. It is Aphrodite who steps forward and turns Helen's face towards Menelaos. At the same time Helen extends her left arm, holding up her himation with her right hand: the himation, which has been draped over both shoulders, spreads away from the body, revealing her in her transparent chiton. The chiton has two kolpoi, the flying ends of the girdle showing below the lower one. Here, and in all the female figures, there is a slight swell or flutter in the drapery, as if stirred by a light breeze. The head wears the same veil as Aphrodite in the other picture, and a stephane, ornamented with a maeander, in front. The forehead-hair is in raised black dots on a light ground. Necklace, ear-ring. On the left shoulder one sees a little bag or ball, a favourite detail of Makron's, already discussed.<note anchored="true" n="iii.36.4"><p>See <ref target="iii.32" n="U">iii p. 32</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.67" type="Vase">Boston 13.67</rs>).</p></note> The left leg is extended frontal. The breasts are small, and as usual in Makron, high. The eye and the middle of the mouth are damaged.</p>

<p>Aphrodite (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*F*R*O*D*I*T*E</foreign>), behind Helen, leans a little back, and from her attitude one would say that she had come up quickly and quietly. How beautiful are the feet of Makron's figures: not only the forms of toe, instep, ankle, heel, but the way his people set their feet down. Makron's women recall the Homeric description of Hera and Athena in the fifth book of the <title>Iliad</title>:</p>
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>ai( de\ ba/thn, trh/rwsi peleia/sin i)/qmaq' o(moi=ai.</l></quote>
<p>'They went their way, with step like turtle-doves.' According to the ancient commentators this only means that they flew off; but surely the poet is thinking of big handsome women who are nevertheless light on their feet.</p>

<p><pb xml:id="iii.37" n="37"/> Aphrodite wears a chiton with two kolpoi, a girdle, a himation over both shoulders, ear-rings, and a saccos with an opening in it behind from which the back-hair escapes. The forehead-hair is like Helen's.</p>

<p>To left of Aphrodite a woman stands with the left leg frontal, looking round towards the scene and holding up a flower. She wears a chiton with a flounce and a kolpos, a girdle, a himation over both shoulders, necklace, ear-rings. Her fair hair is dressed like Peitho's in the other picture, but over the forehead it is worn long, parted in the middle, so that there are no raised dots for curls. One would probably name the figure Peitho, were it not for the inscription, which shows that the painter meant it for Kriseis (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*R*I*S*E*I*S</foreign>).</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The last figure on the left is an old man with long white beard, and abundant white hair bound up into a krobylos by a cord passed twice round it. He wears a full-length chiton, and a himation draped over the left shoulder; holds a T-topped staff in his right hand, and looks towards the scene. His name is Kriseus (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*R*I*S*E*U*S</foreign>).</p>

<p>Who are Kriseus and Kriseis? Kretschmer wrote in his <title>Vaseninschriften</title> (p. 206): 'The names at once recall the Homeric <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Xruseu/s</foreign><note anchored="true" n="iii.37.1"><p>Should be <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Xru/shs</foreign>.</p></note> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Xrushi/s</foreign>, although the presence of the priest of Apollo and his daughter is in no way motived: Kekule (<title>AZ</title>. 1882 pp. 3 ff.) is probably right in assuming that the vase-painter arbitrarily picked two epic names from his memory and applied them to the onlookers, a practice quite common with the earlier vase-painters. It is hardly credible, however, from the grammatical point of view, that <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Kriseu/s</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Krishi/s</foreign>, are simply corruptions of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Xruseu/s</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Xrushi/s</foreign>, as de Witte, for example, thought (<title>Gaz. arch</title>. 1880 p. 63), for even in Attic popular speech <foreign xml:lang="greek">x</foreign> did not become <foreign xml:lang="greek">k</foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="greek">u</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="greek">i</foreign>, and the assumption of a lapsus calami is ruled out by the repetition. Is it possible that Hieron, to whom we owe <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)Agame/smwn</foreign> as a by-form of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)Agame/mnwn</foreign>, has here preserved an ancient variant of the Homeric tradition?' Kretschmer goes on to quote, from Italy, evidence of a form <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Krishi/s</foreign>: <title>Crisida</title> and <title>Creisita</title> on Praenestine cistae, <title>Crisitha</title> on an Etruscan mirror. Kretschmer's suggestion, put forward tentatively, was accepted by Wilhelm Schulze<note anchored="true" n="iii.37.2"><p><title>Kleine Schriften</title> pp. 206-7.</p></note> and by Furtwängler. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff showed<note anchored="true" n="iii.37.3"><p><title>Choephoren</title> p. 252; <title>Pindaros</title> pp. 71-72.

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>According to Kretschmer there is no justification for the presence of a priest of Apollo and the priest's daughter in the episode: but that is not so. In one version of the last night of Troy, Helen fled for refuge to a sanctuary. This is often represented on vases and other monuments; and the deity varies. Sometimes it is Aphrodite, sometimes Athena, and sometimes Apollo: an image of Apollo is shown, or Apollo as well as his image. Makron, too, lays the scene in the sanctuary of Apollo: he has borrowed the name of Apollo's priest from another context, from the opening of the <title>Iliad</title>. To remember that priest is to remember also his daughter: and so the daughter appears in the picture by her father's side.</p>

<p>On a stamnos by the Deepdene Painter in New York the old man in whose presence Menelaos pursues Helen may perhaps be Kriseus.<note anchored="true" n="iii.37.6"><p><rs key="New York 41.162.20" type="Vase">New York 41.162.20</rs>: <title>CV</title>. Gallatin pl. 14; Ghali-Kahil <title>H</title>. pl. 69: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 326 no. 8; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 499 no. 11.</p></note></p>

<p>In point of composition, the handle-figure Priam, as was noted above, is less loosely connected with the picture of Menelaos and Helen than the other handle-figure with the picture of Helen and Paris; in point of subject it is the other way round.</p>

<p>By different treatment of hair and beard, Makron has avoided the impression that the two figures of old men, Kriseus and Priam, one at the left edge of the picture, the other at the right edge, form a pair.</p>

<p>The running maeander is Makron's favourite border, and he hardly ever uses any other. Here, for compactness, while the upper band faces right, the lower faces left. It is worth <pb xml:id="iii.38" n="38"/> while looking at the Brygos Painter's skyphos in Vienna,<note anchored="true" n="iii.38.1"><p>Above, <ref target="iii.33" n="U">iii pp. 33-34</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.186" type="Vase">Boston 13.186</rs>).</p></note> to see what he does with his two bands of maeander, which are interrupted by cross-squares. The lower band faces left; but in the upper, the more conspicuous of the two, the artist has adopted a variety of maeander not found elsewhere in his work: running, and not stopped even by the cross squares, but passing over and under them, so that the sets face alternately right and left: the Brygos Painter too, had compactness in mind.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details of the bodies, for the necklace-dots, for the scales on Menelaos' nape-piece; a brown wash on the lion's body, and on the frontlet of Menelaos' helmet. The hair is nearly all brown. Red for the men's head-fillets, the wreath of Eros, the anklet of Menelaos, sandals, girdles, flowers. White for hair and beard of Kriseus.</p>

<p>In all the figures (except the small Eros) the wall of the teeth is indicated by a vertical relief-line. This was doubtless so in Aeneas and Helen on A, but the part is damaged. In Aphrodite on B, there is a second relief-line, parallel to the first, half-way along the mouth. In several figures on A, the upper edge of the upper lip, and the lower of the lower, are indicated by relief-lines.</p>

<p>The vase bears the signatures both of the potter and of the painter. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*E*R*O*N*E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign> is incised on the handle to left of the side which we call A. The signatures of Hieron are nearly always on the handle, sometimes painted, but more often incised. Here the signature is upside down: for convenience the writer inverted the vase. In the other skyphos with diagonal handles, <rs key="Louvre G 146" type="Vase">Louvre G 146</rs> (<ref target="iii.33" n="U">iii p. 33</ref>) the signature is the right way up.</p>

<p>The painter's signature is on the right of A, written vertically upwards, in red, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*A*K*R*O*N</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*G*R*A*F*S*E*N</foreign>. Furtwängler was the first to recognize that nearly all the many cups with the signature of the potter Hieron were painted by Makron; he was followed by Leonard in 1912.<note anchored="true" n="iii.38.2"><p>Furtwängler in FR. ii p. 130. Leonard <emph>über einige Vasen aus der Werkstatt des Hieron</emph>.</p></note></p>

<p>This is Makron's masterpiece: and of all his splendid works, only two can compare with it: the Berlin maenad cup, and the Triptolemos skyphos in the British Museum.</p>

<p>While Reichhold's drawings give correctly a good many details that are not visible in the photographs, they contain a certain number of slight inaccuracies. I append a list of them, based on comparison with the original vase. I do this in no carping spirit. Reichhold's drawings are not all equally good: but how excellent they are, perhaps only those who have tried to make a copy of a Greek vase-painting can judge. Some of the following points can be made out from the photographs, but not all.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A. Paris has more whisker than in R[eichhold]. R. omits the tip of the left thumb, and the ring on the spear near the butt. There are four brown lines on the left thigh, not three. Not clear in Reichhold's drawing that the tiny round in the right hand of Eros is red. The fingers of Helen's left hand are not quite correct. Her stephane is much damaged. The pattern on it was not as Reichhold has it, but perhaps, I thought, a maeander as in the other picture. I note that Duhn, in his careful description, speaks of a maeander. Considering the friable condition of the vase in its upper part, it is possible that a little more was preserved, and not only here, when he saw it than is now.</p>

<p>The face of Helen, as was said above, has suffered greatly, and R. has restored it freely in his drawing.</p>

<p>In Aphrodite, R. has omitted part of the horizontal stripe on the chiton at mid-calf.</p>

<p>The signature of Makron is spread out and not quite in the right place.</p>

<p>In the boy, R. omits the brown lines on the back of the left hand and on the right arm. There are two lines on the left forearm, not one. The two lines on the right breast, and the line between breast and right shoulder, are omitted or very faint in R.</p>

<p>B. The lines on the back of the right hand are very faint in R. R. has, quite properly, restored the white of hair and beard. The hair was first edged with brown, then covered with white, most of which has disappeared. The beard was bordered with relief-lines and filled in roughly with brown, then covered with white. The ends of the beard were in relief-lines as in the figure of Priam; the forehead-hair may have been treated in the same way: the furrows probably mark the places where relief-lines were once. These relief <pb xml:id="iii.39" n="39"/> lines of beard and hair were no doubt covered by the white, either entirely or almost entirely. The chin of Kriseis is a restoration.</p>

<p>Aphrodite's nostril should be fuller.</p>

<p>In Helen, the toes of both feet are not quite correct. In Menelaos, R. omits eyebrow, the line of the teeth, the brown lines on the left calf, the line near the inner side of the right thigh, most of the dots on the skull-piece of the helmet (all the light squares are dotted) and the black arc on the upper rim of each greave, near the middle. The right foot is more shapely than in R.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In Priam, the right-hand line on the neck should be longer. The right thumbnail is omitted, and a dark line on the palm. The toes and ankles are not quite correct.</p>

<p>Reisch<note anchored="true" n="iii.39.1"><p><title>Zeitschrift für oesterreichische Gymnasien</title> 1887 p. 46.</p></note> was the first to recognize that we may have another signature of Makron, on an earlier work, his small pyxis, fragmentary, in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.39.2"><p><rs key="Athens, Acr. 560" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 560</rs>: <title>JHS</title>. 14 pl. 3, 2; Langlotz pl. 43; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 314 no. 239; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 479 no. 336.</p></note> <foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*A*K*R...</foreign> might also be part of a woman's name; G.

I, symposion (a man reclining, and a woman). A, man, youths, and women; B, men and women, youth and woman. About 490-480 B.C., by Makron (Hartwig pp. 279-80; <title>VA</title>. p. 105 no. 70; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 217 no. 96; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 308 no. 105; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 469 no. 149).</p>

<p>The cup is of type B. The potter-work is by Hieron: characteristic of him, the nearness of the jog to the edge of the foot-plate. The black band underneath the foot is quite narrow, as in all cups fashioned by Hieron and decorated by Makron.</p>

<p>Inside. The maeander is of the form used by Makron in nearly all his cups. A man, wreathed, in a himation, reclines on a couch, his left leg drawn up and the thigh seen frontal, with a doubled cushion under his left elbow, and a small table beside him. He holds a cup in his left hand, and thrusts out his right arm as if in protest: for a woman has stepped suddenly up to him and caught him by the beard. She wears a chiton, with flounce and kolpos, and ear-rings. For the little bunch at the nape, here and in the women on the exterior, see above, <ref target="iii.32" n="U">iii p. 32</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.67" type="Vase">Boston 13.67</rs>). The flying ends of the girdle are seen below the kolpos. There is movement, too, in the scarf that binds the head. The hair may have been dressed in a krobylos, as elsewhere when the scarf is worn, for instance in Peitho on one side of skyphos no. 140 and in Kriseis on the other: but in our cup this part is cut off by the border. The woman's feet rest on a small exergue.</p>

<p>Relief-contours, both inside the cup and outside. Inside, the eyes are dot-and-circle, outside not. The front hair, here and in some at least of the figures outside, is edged with relief-lines against the face. Red for the girdle, the man's wreath, the wreaths of vineleaves that hang, as often, from the table. A repainted fracture runs through the corners of the woman's mouth and nostril, another through the man's left knee.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Outside, on A, two groups, a four and a pair; on B, three pairs. The chief person, the principal lady, is the seated woman on A, who has two admirers, a man and a youth. She wears a chiton, a himation let down to her waist, ear-rings, and the same head-dress as Aphrodite on one side of the skyphos no. 140 and Helen on the other: — a veil so bound as to form a kind of 'saccos'. She holds out a flower and a mirror. Her seat is a simple stool with a cushion on it. The forehead-hair is fair, and is edged with four relief-lines against the face. The man and the youth both wear himatia, and so do the other youths and men in the picture. Each holds a flower in one hand, and a stick, by the top, with the other. The fourth figure in this group is a woman in chiton and himation, who moves up<pb xml:id="iii.40" n="40"/> eagerly, with a fragrant sprig in her left hand and the right arm extended. In the minor group on this half, a woman steps quickly up to a youth, puts one foot between his feet, takes him by the arm with one hand, and stretches out the other towards his face. She wears chiton and himation, and the ends of her hair are tied in a small bun. The youth leans on his stick, holding a flower, in the same attitude as the man in the major group.</p>

<p>On B, in the middle, a woman with outstretched arms approaches a man. Her attitude is much the same as in the group just described, but the man is distinctly less interested than his companions and the woman is a shade less confident. The man has no flower. The ends of his hair are twisted up into a small bun behind. The woman's hair is in rolls behind the ear. She wears chiton, himation, ear-rings, and her chiton has the flounce, serving as 'false sleeves', which we have seen already inside the cup. (The other four women have the more usual kind of false sleeves.) The man's left elbow is repainted and there is a little retouching in the part of himation to right of it.</p>

<p>In the group of woman and youth on the right of this, the attitude of the woman is much the same as in the last two groups, and with full confidence she advances to embrace the youth, who holds out a flower towards her. She wears chiton, himation, ear-rings, and her hair in a saccos of the same type as Aphrodite's in the Menelaos scene on the signed skyphos no. 140.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In the left-hand group on this half, a man — of a different disposition from the other — sits on a cushioned folding-stool, holding a flower, and is approached by a girl who bends her head and extends her arms as if ready to climb on to his lap: if so, the next movement would be shown on a cup by Makron in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.40.1"><p><rs key="New York 12.231.1" type="Vase">New York 12.231.1</rs>: Pfuhl fig. 448; Richter and Hall pl. 51: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 307 no. 102; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 468 no. 146.</p></note> The girl has taken off her himation, for freer play, and wears only a chiton, with two kolpoi, ear-rings, and a saccos of the same form as the woman in the group just described. A troublesome restoration has taken the place of the missing right hand and forearm; small parts of the man's thighs are also restored.</p>

<p>A large flute-case, with the mouthpiece-box, is suspended in the field to right of the first man, and at the right corner of the picture a net-bag containing apples or other round things. Under each handle, as often in Makron, a seat with a cushion on it. Part of one seat is missing. The brown inner markings on the men's bodies are lost in the photograph. Red for flowers, wreaths, head-fillets, and the tags at the ends of the carrying-loop of the flute-case.</p>

<p>This is an ordinary specimen of Makron's style in its fully developed phase, an ample and handsome style.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B. The potter-work is by Hieron. The preservation is not good.</p>

<p>Inside, a youth, leaning on his stick, addresses a boy. Both wear himatia, and the boy is closely wrapped up in his. A chip to right of the youth's back. The wreaths are done in red.</p>

<p>Outside, three pairs on each half. On B, the boys stand still, wrapped in their himatia, and do not react. The men lean on their sticks, and two of them speak, the third looks only. What we call A is the more varied half. In the middle group, the boy sets his foot forward in an attitude of great assurance; his right hand is no longer concealed in his himation but thrust out: he is evidently speaking and putting his own point of view. The man holds a flower. In the left-hand group, the boy, who seems a little older than his companions, and wears his himation in the same way as the men, also shows assurance. The man holds a net-bag, the boy a sprig in one hand, and in the other a special sort of <pb xml:id="iii.41" n="41"/> staff: it is one of those long arrows which we see used as walking-sticks by boys on other vases. The boy Herakles has one on the skyphos by the Pistoxenos Painter in Schwerin; and so has a boy on a cup by Makron, somewhat earlier than ours, in Munich, and another on an oinochoe by the Tarquinia Painter in the Thorvaldsen Museum, Copenhagen.<note anchored="true" n="iii.41.1"><p>Schwerin: Pfuhl fig. 471; FR. pl. 163, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 576 no. 16; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 862 no. 30. <rs key="Munich 2655" type="Vase">Munich 2655</rs>: <title>WV</title>.

The himation is loosely draped over his shoulders and held with both hands. The left foot is extended frontal. The head must have been turned to the right.

<p>Relief-contours throughout. Red for flowers and wreaths. The right arm of the man in the left-hand group on A, as the incised sketch shows, was originally meant to be raised.</p>

<p>The cup is in Makron's fully developed style.</p>

<p>Diameter 0.231, height 0.085. Formerly in the Roman market (1899); given by Fiske Warren and Edward Perry Warren. I, a boy running; A, two youths pursuing a boy; B, a youth and a man pursuing a boy. About 480 B.C., by Makron (<title>VA</title>. p. 106 no. 91; <title>Att.

<p>The cup is of Type B. The potter-work is by Hieron. Outside, on A, a boy runs, holding his himation with both hands, and looking back at a youth who drops his stick and runs after him; a second youth runs up from the left as if to cut off the retreat. The youths wear himatia, hanging over both shoulders or one. The scene in B is similar, but the pursuit is less energetic, the pursuer on the left is a man, and the youth has a flower in one hand. On the left, a string-bag is suspended.</p>

<p>Inside, a boy runs, holding his himation with both hands, but not turning round. He has rather a sheepish look, and is evidently running home.</p>

<p>Relief-contour throughout. The brown lines for the minor markings of the body are visible in the photographs of the interior. Red for the head-fillets and the flower.</p>

<p>This is one of many small cups from the fully developed stage of Makron's style, with a single figure inside, and three figures on each half of the exterior, in scenes from everyday life. One in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek has some figures that recall ours;<note anchored="true" n="iii.41.3"><p><rs key="Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 34" type="Vase">Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek 34</rs>: Poulsen <title>Aus einer alten Etruskerstadt</title> pll. 15-16: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 312 no. 188; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 475 no. 264.</p></note> for drawing, a cup in Berkeley is among those that are specially close.<note anchored="true" n="iii.41.4"><p><rs key="Berkeley 8.3222" type="Vase">Berkeley 8.3222</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 33, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 306 no. 80; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 466 no. 107.</p></note></p>

About 480 B.C., by the Antiphon Painter (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 231 no. 26; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 337 no. 26); already assigned to the Antiphon Group in <title>VA</title>. p. 111 ('Lysis-Laches-Lykos Group', the earlier name for it), and <title>Att.

<p>The foot is missing and much else, but enough remains to show that the outside of the cup was plain. Inside, a young she-ass walks with a load on her back. Over a saddle-cloth which has a criss-cross pattern and a fringe, is a wooden saddle, fastened by means of a saddle-girth and a thinner cord attached to the end of each 'arm' and passing under the belly; on the saddle is a striped holdall, doubled, and lashed to the animal's shoulders and round its hock. The roundish thing on top of the holdall, with leaf-shaped edge, is the flap covering the aperture through which the contents of such bags are stuffed. The donkey is bridled, and the reins are tied loosely on the shoulder, with the ends hanging. The ears are alert, the eye looks sidelong. The mane is cropped except on the forehead and the top of the head, and on the shoulder, where a small tuft is left for mounting. Two small teats are shown.</p>

<p>The dark stripe on the shoulder, and the dark rings or bars on the legs, are seldom absent in red-figure pictures of donkeys. The bars on the legs were called <foreign xml:lang="greek">muklai/</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="greek">mu/kloi</foreign>: see Pfeiffer's note (<title>Callimachus</title> i p. 433) on the poet's line</p>
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>e)/stin moi *Ma/gnhs e)nnea/muklos o)/nos.</l></quote>
<p>It is to be feared, it seems, that Callimachus meant a donkey nine years old. If so, he probably changed the meaning of <foreign xml:lang="greek">mu/klos</foreign> for some perverse reason. I note, without pressing the point, that our donkey has nine bars on each of her forelegs.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Donkeys in Greek art are usually called mules by the moderns, 'mule' being felt to be a more respectable word and thought than 'donkey'. There are of course mules: each animal must be scanned individually. The bars on the legs are not a perfect criterion, as they also occur in mules, and even in horses.<note anchored="true" n="iii.42.1"><p>'Dun [colour in horses]... Mule markings, down the back and across the shoulder, and zebra stripes across the arms and thighs, are generally well-marked on animals of this colour. It is not common in English horses, but is frequently met in India'. <title>Animal Management</title> (<title>War Office Manual, 1908</title>) p. 31.</p></note></p>

<p>For the subject of our cup, compare a black-figured skyphos in the Louvre, <rs key="Louvre F 410" type="Vase">Louvre F 410</rs>, which has a donkey laden, and a small male creature (pygmy?) sitting on his neck. A donkey as sole subject appears on a gold ring in Boston<note anchored="true" n="iii.42.2"><p><title>Lewes House Gems</title> pl. 4, 83.</p></note> and on coins of Mende.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown for the criss-cross on the saddle-cloth, for the hairs at the root of the ear and those just above the muzzle, and for vertical marks below the knee. Red for bridle, reins, cords, and the inscription in the field, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N*I*K*O*S*T*R*A*T*O*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The inscription in the exergue, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*A*X*E*S*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>, is in brown. This is typical work of the Antiphon Painter, with its bold, free drawing, strong relief-lines, and thick maeander. The 'odd man' is south-east.</p>

<p>The name of Laches occurs on many cups by the Antiphon Painter or of his school, the name of Nikostratos on five other vases by various painters.<note anchored="true" n="iii.42.3"><p><title>ARV.1</title> pp. 929 and 937; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1603.</p></note> Hartwig noticed the curious fact that a Nikostratos and a Laches were strategoi together in 427 B.C., were in joint command of an Athenian force sent to help the Argives in 418, and both fell at Mantinea in 413.

<p>Diameter 0.2345, height 0.092. From the Bourguignon collection, Naples. Hartwig pl. 62, 2; the shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 196. I, armed youth. By the Antiphon Painter (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 230 no. 17; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 336 no. 18); already assigned to the Antiphon Group ('Lysis-Laches-Lykos Group') in <title>VA</title>. p. 111 and in <title>Att. V</title>. p. 234 no. 60.</p>

<p><pb xml:id="iii.43" n="43"/>The cup is of Type B; the potter-work is attributed by Bloesch to Euphronios (<title>F.A.S.</title> p. 79 note 136 and p. 80 no. 61).</p>

<p>Inside, a youth starts to run, looking back, a spear in his right hand, his left arm extended in his chlamys, holding it away from his body. Besides the chlamys he wears sandals, stockings, a sword and a hat of Robin Hood type, with a loop at the top for suspension. Hartwig suggested that the youth might be a <foreign xml:lang="greek">peri/polos</foreign>, one of the epheboi serving on frontier duty, and indeed that he might be setting out with a message.<note anchored="true" n="iii.43.1"><p>See Hauser in <title>Jb</title>. 11 pp. 187-88.</p></note> It is quite possible.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown lines for the minor details of the body, many of which are omitted in Hartwig's drawing, and others miscopied. The restorations, too, are not given correctly by Hartwig: our reproduction omits the chief one. The lesser folds of the chlamys are in brown. Red for the cords of the hat, the baldrick, the sandals and stockings, the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*U*K*O*S [*K*A]*L*O*S</foreign>.</p>

<p>Hartwig attributed the cup to Onesimos, and it is certainly near him: the spare forms of arms and legs are Onesiman, so are the shortness of the body from the pit of the stomach to the navel, the treatment of the folds on the shoulders, and the form of the maeander: but I take the artist to be the Antiphon Painter, strongly influenced by Onesimos: the two painters were in the same workshop.</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B. The outside was plain. The inside has been studied, from the point of view of subject, by Hartwig in <title>Jb</title>. 14 pp. 155-8, by myself in <title>Potter and Painter</title> pp. 10-11, and by Noble in <title>AJA</title>. 1960 p. 314; see also Reichhold in FR. i p. 21, which I do not well understand. A youth sitting on a stool, with his himation let down to his waist, holds a cup by the foot, the bowl resting lightly on his thigh, and draws with a fine brush held in his right hand. The hair or hairs of the brush are rendered by a single curved relief-line, which does not show in the photograph but may be seen in the drawing published by Hartwig. The grip of the brush is that which is used in China and Japan and which according to G. L. Stout was widely used in the West before 1500.<note anchored="true" n="iii.43.2"><p>In <title>Technical Studies</title> 10 p. 8 and 1942 pp. 157 ff.</p></note> In his left hand our painter holds a small object, thin, pointed, and swelling towards the middle, which has received several explanations, none of them perfectly convincing.<note anchored="true" n="iii.43.3"><p>See <title>PP</title>. pp. 10-11; and Noble in <title>AJA.</title> 1960 p. 314. What is odd, if it is so, is that the person should be shown holding in one hand the instrument of one process while with the other hand he uses the instrument of another process. This sometimes happens in life, but in representation one expects that one characteristic action should be concentrated upon, and not mixed up with another.</p></note> Another <pb xml:id="iii.44" n="44"/> puzzle is the two sets of three dots on the cup held by the painter, in the middle of each half. The black line on the cup must be the handle; the upper edge of it has disappeared in a fracture. An aryballos and a strigil hang on the wall, and a walking-stick leans against it. The mouth of the aryballos is missing, but one sees the lower ends of leather stripes attached to the carrying-band: Miss Haspels has explained the system.<note anchored="true" n="iii.44.1"><p>In <title>BSA</title>. 29 pp. 221-3.</p></note> Stick, strigil, and aryballos are not vocational, but point forward to sunset, when the youth will be free to wash, dress, and walk home.</p>

<p>The 'billet-spaces' of the maeander border are rare in vase-painting outside the cups of the Antiphon Painter, his associates and followers, and his older colleague the Colmar Painter.</p>

<p>In <title>ARV</title>. I attributed the cup to the Antiphon Painter himself: safer, I now think, to place it among the works in his manner: it is close to him and may be his own, but it has an unusual lightness of touch.</p>

<p>Studniczka gives the provenience as Capua, but in error.</p>

<p>In the twenty-second book of the <title>Iliad</title>, near the end of the fight between Achilles and Hector, Zeus took a golden balance and placed two <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Kh=re qana/toio</foreign>, banes or dooms of death, in the scales, one for Hector, and one for Achilles. He raised the balance, and the doom of Hector sank. Then Apollo, who had been helping Hector, abandoned him. The word <foreign xml:lang="greek">kh=r</foreign> may be rendered 'doom' or 'bane', often thought of personally as a destructive spirit. In the lines just quoted, for the sake of simplicity we translated 'the doom of Hector sank': but what the poet says is 'the fated day, <foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)/simon h)=mar</foreign>, of Hector sank'. This '<foreign xml:lang="greek">ai)/simon h)=mar</foreign>' is evidently equivalent, or practically so, to the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kh=r</foreign> just placed in the scale. Hector had previously said that he feared not, for no man would send him to Hades above and beyond fate:</p>
<quote xml:lang="greek"><l>ou) ga/r ti/s m' u(pe\r ai)=san a)nh\r *)/Aidi proia/yei.</l></quote>
<p>Except it be the appointed hour. Well, the appointed hour has come.</p>

<p>Later, we hear of 'Zeus with the balance' in the trilogy of Aeschylus that dealt with the hero Memnon, son of Eos. All that remains of the tragedy <title>Memnon</title>, the first in the trilogy, is two or three detached lines; of the <title>Psychostasia</title>, the play that followed the <title>Memnon</title>, all we have is four words; but we have also a few brief allusions to two great scenes or tableaux in it. The lexicographer Pollux, speaking of stage-terms, says: 'On the theologeion [platform of the gods] which is above the skene [the stage-building] deities appear on high, like Zeus and those about him in the <title>Psychostasia</title>.' Plutarch provides a few more particulars: Zeus held a balance containing [not the Keres this time but] the psychai [souls or rather lives] of Achilles and Memnon, while Thetis and Eos, the divine mothers of the two heroes, stood one on each side of Zeus entreating him to spare their sons.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The date of the Memnonian trilogy is not known. The utmost limits are the beginning of the fifth century, when the first plays of Aeschylus were produced, and 456, the year of his death. Our trilogy can hardly have been very early, and it has been thought to be late on the ground that three speaking actors were needed for the Psychostasia scene — Eos, Thetis, and Zeus. But is it likely that Zeus spoke?</p>

<p>In any case we have nine vase-paintings with the Psychostasia of Achilles and Memnon, and some of them, are earlier than Aeschylus's trilogy can have been, and indeed than his first appearance as a writer for the stage. The psychai are represented as tiny figures, one in each scale: thrice as winged and unarmed; but more often as warriors in the attitude <pb xml:id="iii.45" n="45"/> of attack. The unarmed figures are usually taken to be Keres, but they are most probably Psychai like the tiny warriors in the other pictures.<note anchored="true" n="iii.45.1"><p>On the Psychostasia: Studniczka in <title>Jb</title>. 26 pp. 132-5: Lung <title>Memnon</title> pp. 13-27; Wilamowitz-Moellendorf <title>Glaube der Hellenen</title> i pp. 271-2; Nilsson <title>Zeus mit der Schicksalswaage</title>; Wüst in <title>ARV</title>. 36 pp. 162-71; Ciotti in <title>Arti figurative</title> 12 pp. 15-16; Ricci in <title>Annuario</title> 24-26 pp. 47-54; Hölscher in <title>Gnomon</title> 27 pp. 392-3; Erika Simon <title>Die Geburt der Aphrodite</title> pp. 72-82; Schauenberg in <title>Bonner Jahrbücher</title> 161 pp. 227-8.

<p>Add, as no. 10, the Etruscan mirror in Madrid (<rs key="Madrid 558" type="Vase">Madrid 558</rs>: Gerhard <title>E.S.</title> pl. 235, 1; Thouvenot pl. 22), of Group Z (see <title>EVP</title>. pp. 130-2 and <title>JHS</title>. 69 pp. 16-17).</p>

<p>In the seven Attic vases (nos. 2-8), in the Campanian (no. 9), and in the drawing on the Etruscan mirror (no. 10), the balance is held not by Zeus but by Hermes. Zeus is sometimes present, but he does not hold the balance. The divine mothers, Thetis and Eos, hasten up. Sometimes Achilles and Memnon themselves are seen fighting, and the two scenes — the heroes on earth, the decision in heaven — are combined. These pictures show that the Psychostasia of Achilles and Memnon was not invented by Aeschylus, but adopted by him from an earlier poem. This can hardly have been other than the epic attributed to Arktinos of Miletos, which took up the story of the Trojan War at the point where the <title>Iliad</title> left it, and was called <title>Aithiopis</title> because it dealt with Memnon, king of the Ethiopians. Far the best of the vases is the volute-krater by the Kleophrades Painter (no. 4), which has more than a little of that noble grandeur which the tableau in the drama of Aeschylus must surely have had. Epiktetos, in his many-figured picture, has treated the Psychostasia as an action-piece, and even Hermes who holds the balance is in lively movement.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>From the evidence of the eight vases and the mirror we should naturally conclude that in the <title>Aithiopis</title> the balance was held by Hermes, and that when Aeschylus placed it in the hand of Zeus he was reverting to the precedent given by the <title>Iliad</title> in the story of <pb xml:id="iii.46" n="46"/> Achilles and Hector. But the new Eastern Greek hydria (no. 1) shows that the conclusion would have been premature: for there it is Zeus who holds the balance, and Hermes is not present. The picture is quite different from the others: on the right, Achilles and Memnon are seen fighting; on the left, Zeus is seated, with the two goddesses imploring him, Eos kneeling, Thetis standing with outstretched arms. We can no longer say that in the <title>Aithiopis</title> it was Hermes who held the balance, and are left to conjecture why the Attic artists placed it in his hand.</p>

<p>After the middle of the fifth century there are no more Attic Psychostasiai, or at least none have reached us. On a vase contemporary with the Boston stamnos, the bell-krater by the Oreithyia Painter in Palermo,<note anchored="true" n="iii.46.1"><p><rs key="Palermo V 779" type="Vase">Palermo V 779</rs>: Politi <title>Vasi di premio illustrati</title> pll. 7-8; <title>CV</title>. pll. 35-36 and pl. 37, 1-3: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 325 no. 5; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 496 no. 5.</p></note> Thetis and Eos appeal to Zeus on behalf of their sons, but there is no balance; and in the great bronze group by an Attic sculptor, Lykios son of Myron, at Olympia, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Zeu/s te kai\ *Qe/tis te kai\ *(Hme/ra to\n *Di/a u(pe\r tw=n te/knwn i(keteu/ousai</foreign>, with the two heroes fighting, and four other pairs of Greek and Trojan, if Zeus held a balance, Pausanias would perhaps have said so.</p>

<p>The picture on the Boston stamnos is conventional, a broad, symmetrical three-figure composition without finer quality. Hermes stands in the middle, with the right leg frontal, holding the balance with his right hand and his caduceus in his left, and looking round at Thetis who runs towards him with a gesture of pleasure, while Eos, on the other side of him, shows distress. In each scale there is a small figure of a naked warrior, helmeted, with spear and shield. The left scale is slightly lower than the other.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Hermes wears a chitoniskos, with kolpos, and a chlamys; his petasos is slung round his neck. The goddesses wear a chiton with kolpos, a himation shawl-wise, and a sort of saccos. Thetis has bracelets, Eos a flounce as well as a kolpos. A pair of stripes runs down the side of her chiton.</p>

<p>On the back of the stamnos, an old man, seen frontal, turns round towards his companions, a man and a youth. All three lean on their sticks, and look like a trio of spectators: but they cannot be connected with the picture on the front of the vase. The men wear formal costume — long chiton as well as himation — , the youth wears a himation only.</p>

<p>There is little relief-contour in either picture: for the faces and napes; the hands of Thetis, the right arm of Hermes and his petasos; the hands, left forearm, saccos of Eos; the beard and right hand of the old man on B. Brown for the minor details of Hermes' legs, and the sinew of the old man's neck; and, as usual in this painter, for several particulars that are commonly done in black: the outline of the kolpos in Hermes and Eos, the lower edge of the goddesses' chitons, their toes, and the old man's toes. Red for the wreath of Hermes, his petasos-cord; the balance except the beam; the manikins; the three wreaths on the reverse; and the inscriptions, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*O*P*A*I*S *K*A*L*O*S</foreign>; on each side of the vase. The painter had forgotten the ball of Eos' right thumb.</p>

<p>The style of drawing, slight as it is, has much of Makron; and to Makron I at first attributed it, as a very late work. Afterwards I saw that it was by a minor follower, the Syracuse Painter, whose personality had become clear.</p>

<p>In shape, the vase has a good deal in common with other stamnoi contemporary or nearly, for instance <rs key="Leyden PC 88" type="Vase">Leyden PC 88</rs> by the Hephaisteion Painter, or <rs key="Boston 00.342" type="Vase">Boston 00.342</rs> by the Blenheim:<note anchored="true" n="iii.46.2"><p>Leyden: Jacobsthal <title>O</title>. pl. 94, a: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 192; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 298 no. 2.

A pity that the vase sagged in firing.

<p>The foot, much fretted, is lipped. In shape the vase differs little from the contemporary lekythos by the Telephos Painter (no. 158), or, for that matter, from the Providence Painter's lekythoi (nos. 88-90). The shoulder-decoration is that conventional in full-sized lekythoi. There is a band of running maeander above the picture, and another below: it is our painter's favourite pattern.</p>

<p>Zeus, tall, long-backed, sits naked on a rock, over which he has spread his mantle, and with bent head and parted lips eases the infant Dionysos out of his left thigh. Hermes stands in front of him, looking on, holding both his own caduceus, butt to ground, and the sceptre of Zeus. He wears chitoniskos, chlamys, petasos, and winged boots. The long hair of Zeus is bound with a fillet, and also wreathed.</p>

<p>Restored, the ends of Zeus' beard, parts of the hair where it falls over shoulder and back, the upper part of his chest, his knees, part of his right foot. There is little relief-contour: for the front of Zeus' trunk, for his arms and left leg, for the brow of Hermes, his nape, the back of his left hand, the caduceus, the sceptre. Brown for the minor lines on the bodies and some of the detail in the winglets. Red for the wreaths of Zeus and Dionysos, the head-fillet (or petasos-strap) of Hermes, and the meaningless inscription in two lines, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*S*N*O*S*N *K*O*S*N</foreign>. Very similar combinations are common in our painter: his favourite letters are nu, omikron, and sigma.

<p>To these we may add another lost vase, unless it be the same as the Patierno, which is unlikely: it was no. 36 in the sale of Sir Henry Englefield's collection (Christie, 6-8 March 1823) and was bought by Samuel Rogers; it sounds Italiote:—</p>

A, seesaw; B, man or youth. About 470-460 B.C., by one of the early mannerists, the Leningrad Painter.</p>

<p>In <title>VA</title>. pp. 118-20 I grouped a number of mannerist vases with these fragments under the name of 'Seesaw Painter'. Later (<title>Att. V.</title> pp. 239 and 249) I saw that the fragments were probably not by the same hand as the rest: I therefore detached them and placed them amongst the works of 'undetermined mannerists' and gave a new name to the painter of the other vases — 'Pig Painter'. In <title>ARV</title>. pp. 377 and 959 the fragments appear under the heading 'Mannerist Group: very close to the Leningrad Painter, if not his work'. The Leningrad Painter is the 'brother' of the Pig Painter, and the two artists are not always quite easy to tell apart. It is now clear to me that the vase is in fact by the Leningrad Painter (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 569 no. 49).</p>

<p>The name-piece of the Leningrad Painter is now figured in Gorbunova and Peredolskaya <title>Mastera grecheskikh raspisnykh vaz</title> p. 69.</p>

<p>Our vase was a column-krater (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 959) and not as I formerly thought (before I knew of the reverse fragment) a hydria of black-figure type.</p>

<p>A. On the front of the vase, beside a fruit-tree, two girls are playing at seesaw. A long plank is laid on a short thin one which rests on the log of a tree-trunk. Both girls wear the chiton only, girt, with a kolpos in front. The chiton of the left-hand girl is thicker and richer than the other. Above the waist it is spotted; a band with a pattern of dots runs down it; at the ankles it has a border with a pattern of arcs — probably lotus-buds; and at mid-calf there is a row of winged horses galloping. Winged horses occur on other rich garments, for instance the himation of Demeter on the skyphos by Makron in London.<note anchored="true" n="iii.48.5"><p><rs key="London E 140" type="Vase">London E 140</rs>: FR. pl. 161: <title>CV</title>. pl. 28, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 301 no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 459 no. 3.</p></note> Ear-rings are worn, and a necklace. A fillet passes round the hair, the upper part of which is drawn tight to the skull and the lower part confined in a small bag.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The other girl has a scarf tied round her head, one end of which is seen at breast-level before the fragment ends.</p>

<p>B. There was only one figure on the reverse, a youth or man in a himation standing to right, in back-view.</p>

<p>The pictures are not framed. A red line runs round the vase below the feet of the figures.</p>

<p>Relief-contours on A, not on B. Brown for the nostril, the necklace, the ear-rings, the spots on the chiton, the winged horses, the sparse folds on the skirt of the left-hand girl, the rings on the log. Red for the head-fillet and the leaves, white for the fruit.</p>

<p>The only other pictures of a seesaw are on two Attic hydriai, one by the Dwarf Painter, in Madrid, the other by the Painter of Athens 1454, in Athens; on a cup by the Codrus Painter in the collection of Miss Iris Cornelia Love, New York; and on two Italiote vases, a bell-krater in Reggio, and a calyx-krater in Syracuse.

<p><pb xml:id="iii.49" n="49"/> The name of the seesaw plank, and of the game, was probably <foreign xml:lang="greek">pe/teuron</foreign> (see Housman on Manilius 5, 439), Latin <term xml:lang="la">peteurum</term> and <term xml:lang="la">petaurum</term>, although the words may also have had a wider significance.</p>

<p>Prof. Spyridakis has kindly provided me with a list of modern Greek words for seesaw, which I transcribe.

The <foreign xml:lang="greek">zugo</foreign>-words are appropriate, whether one thinks of a 'yoke' or rather of 'the beam of a balance', and one feels that they might be derived from ancient Greek.</p>

<p>The death of Argos. About 470-460 B.C. Mannerist Group (<title>VA</title>. p. 121) and by the Agrigento Painter (<title>Att. V.</title> p. 245 no. 39; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 381 no. 62; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 579 no. 84).</p>

<p>The hydria, with a picture, framed, on the shoulder, is a favourite type of vase in the Mannerist workshop. The patterns, too, — black lotusbud, net, line — bare, traditional, and loveless — are those most frequently used by the Mannerists.</p>

<p>The mouth of the vase is lipped, and decorated with egg-pattern. The topside of the mouth is reserved. The foot has a double curve.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in and near the sanctuary of Argive Hera. Her altar is seen; a Doric column indicates a building, her temple; and small plants a meadow or pasture. Hermes draws his sword to attack Argos, who flees, looking round and extending one arm towards the god; his charge, the heifer Io, runs off. Io and Argos are in the middle of the picture; the person in the left half who corresponds to Hermes in the right is a priestess; she stands facing the others, holding sceptre and temple-key. On the extreme left, a man looks on, leaning on his stick, with right arm akimbo and left hand raised in a gesture, one would say, of surprise. On the extreme right, the figure corresponding to the man is a woman standing frontal, looking towards the middle, and raising both forearms.</p>

<p>Argos is dressed as a herdsman, in a goatskin and a skin hat, with sandals and stockings; a sword is slung round him, and he holds a club. His hair and beard are somewhat rough, and his body is covered with eyes. For the hat see <ref target="ii.48" n="U">ii pp. 48-9</ref> (<rs key="Boston 10.185" type="Vase">Boston 10.185</rs>). Hermes wears a chlamys, <pb xml:id="iii.50" n="50"/> with a petasos hanging at his shoulders. The women wear chiton, himation, ear-rings, bracelets. The hair of the priestess is bound with a cord, forming a chignon, and she has a necklace; the hair of the other woman is in a saccos, which ends in a tassel or pompon.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Io herself has been priestess of Hera, <foreign xml:lang="greek">klh|dou=xos *)/Hras</foreign> in the words of Aeschylus. The priestess here is her successor. The sceptre has the common barber's pole-ornament.<note anchored="true" n="iii.50.1"><p>See <title>AJA</title>. 1939 p. 639.</p></note> The head of it is done very roughly: the painter forgot to define the fleur-de-lis top. The temple-key has a form often seen in representations of priestesses on vases and in sculpture, and a bronze temple-key of this type, in Boston, bears an inscription which shows that it belonged to the temple of Artemis at Lousoi in Arcadia (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*T*A*S*A*R*T*A*M*I*T*O*S</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*T*A*S*E*N*L*O*U*S*O*I*S</foreign>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.50.2"><p>Diels in <title>Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie</title> 1908. p. 27 and <title>Antike Technik</title> p. 46 fig. 7.

<p>The figures on the left and right of the picture were called Zeus and Hera by Petersen, and all subsequent writers have followed him. Zeus and Hera would be perfectly in place, but the artist has not in any way characterized the figures as Hera and Zeus, and must surely have intended them for the father and mother of Io, whether he would have been able to name them or not: Inachos, and Melia (or Argeia).</p>

<p>The altar is drawn in the same way as here on a hydria of the same type in Indianapolis, which was attributed to an undetermined mannerist in <title>ARV</title>., but is in fact by the Agrigento Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.50.4"><p><rs key="Indianapolis 47.34" type="Vase">Indianapolis 47.34</rs>: <title>AJA</title>. 1917 pp. 38 and 46; <title>Bull.

<p>There is little relief-contour. Brown is used for most of the details on the heifer, for a line on the belly of Argos, for the marks on his hat, for the necklace; a brown wash covers the goatskin, with darker markings on it; the lower side of Hermes' petasos-brim is also washed with brown. Red for the wreath of Hermes, his petasos-cord, his baldrick, for the head-fillets of the two left-hand figures, for the plants; a red line runs round the neck of the vase.</p>

<p>This is very much a subject-piece. The stumpy figures have a not very sharp-witted look, like all our painter's persons. </p>

<p>Bought in Athens, so probably from Greece. Height as restored (base and foot are modern) 0.325. Brommer <title>Satyroi</title> fig. 18, whence <title>Bull. van de Vereeniging</title> 17 p. 11 (van Hoorn); Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 14; [F. F. Jones] <title>The Theater in Ancient Art</title> fig. 1; <title>Hesp.</title> 24 pl. 86 b. Scene from a satyr-play. About 470-460 B.C.: Mannerist Group (<title>VA</title>. p. 121; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 250 no. 33), and very close to the Leningrad Painter if not his work (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 377 no. 5); definitely assigned to him in <title>ARV.2</title> p. 571 no. 75.</p>

<p>I have discussed this vase in <title>Hesperia</title> 24, pp. 309-11, and part of what follows is repeated from there.</p>

<p>The side of the mouth is black, the topside of it reserved. The hydria is of the same type as no. 150, which is from the same workshop.</p>

<p>The picture, as Edward Robinson recognized, represents a scene from a satyr-play.<note anchored="true" n="iii.51.2"><p><title>BMFA Report</title> 1903 p. 71 no. 57.</p></note> Five satyrs are shown. In two of them the middle of the body is missing. The other three wear the distinctive drawers of the satyr-play: they are therefore not simply satyrs, but satyrs of drama. Facing them is the flute-player, in formal costume, who in drama provides the music. He bends a little as he plays, and beats time with his right foot. Behind him, up against the side-border, an old man dressed in a himation stands looking on. He is not characterized as an actor or other performer: in such pictures there is often a 'civilian', who is hard to name: our man is perhaps the choregus, but might also be a character in the play.</p>

<p>The fractures are repainted. In the foremost satyr, parts of the thighs, of the knees, of the left forearm, are modern, also the right foot, and the right foot of the satyr behind him.</p>

<p>The satyrs dance up in various attitudes. The leader has just set down one leg of a piece of furniture — couch or throne — on a low platform. The other three legs are carried by the three satyrs who follow him. The throne or couch is being put together for some kind of celebration. In the remaining satyr the back of the head is concealed by the side-border, and the face except the forehead is among the parts now missing. He too brings a piece of furniture or part of one. In the play, other satyrs, the rest of the chorus, may have fetched other requisites, or may have been content to encourage the workers and get in their way. One may fancy that the job was not done without much jostling and confusion, and some knocks and tumbles, grunts, howls, and screams.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The rectangular legs fetched by the first four satyrs are of a familiar type which would suit either couch or throne, but a couch is perhaps the more likely. The thing held by the fifth satyr might be expected to be another part of the same piece of furniture; but it appears to be something else, a seat with stretchers and turned legs, held, of course, upside down, and the foot cut off by the upper border. I cannot quote an exact parallel to the shape, but for the leg compare the wooden one in Richter <title>Ancient Furniture</title> fig. 94, and for the stretchers ibid. figs. 8 and 38. If the two objects are couch and seat, one thinks <pb xml:id="iii.52" n="52"/> of those many reliefs and pictures in which a god, a hero, or a man reclines on a couch, while a woman sits facing him on a chair or stool.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that the leg already in position ends differently below from the others, as if it were set into a block. One might expect the block for the second leg to be represented as well, but it is not. As to the platform, a platform is necessary wherever there is no proper floor, or where the floor is uneven. Such platforms are often shown in symposion scenes on vases, for instance on the cup by Douris in the British Museum, or on those by the Euaion Painter in the Louvre.<note anchored="true" n="iii.52.1"><p><rs key="London E 49" type="Vase">London E 49</rs>: <title>WV</title>. 6 pl. 10, whence Hoppin i p. 241. <rs key="Louvre G 466" type="Vase">Louvre G 466</rs> and <rs key="Louvre G 467" type="Vase">Louvre G 467</rs>: Pottier pl. 150.</p></note></p>

<p>The hair of the satyrs is rendered in an unusual manner, which Brommer may be right in attributing to the influence of the stage-mask. Three of the satyrs wear a cord, by way of amulet, round one ankle, and two at least of them a similar cord round the right wrist: see <ref target="ii.39" n="U">ii p. 39</ref> (<rs key="Boston 76.46" type="Vase">Boston 76.46</rs>). The flute-player has short hair and a trim beard. He is dressed in a long, sleeved garment of thick material, ornamented with black circles, the centres of which are marked in brown. The shoes have the same dot-and-circle ornament as the robe. A spotted chaplet is worn, a wreath, and the phorbeia. On this costume, and on other matters concerning scenes from drama on vases, see <title>Hesp.</title> 24 pp. 305-19.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The hair and beard of the old man, as often in figures of old men on vases, are left blank.</p>

<p>Relief-contours throughout.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to associate the picture with the <title>Thalamopoioi</title> of Aeschylus, which may have been a satyr-play: but what little is known about the <title>Thalamopoioi</title> (the name, and a two-line quotation) does not correspond to what is depicted.</p>

<p>The chief guest might be Herakles: satyrs are sometimes shown waiting on him, and on a famous Italiote vase in Taranto Herakles is seen reclining and a satyr bringing him a table:<note anchored="true" n="iii.52.2"><p><title>CV</title>. IV Dr pl. 26.</p></note> but other possibilities are numberless.</p>

<p>The signature of the potter, in red, runs round the upper side of the foot, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*E*R*O*N*M*E*D*O*N*T*O*S*E*P*O*I[*E]</foreign>. A strange place for a signature, but I cannot say that it is not genuine, and Mr. W. J. Young, who has examined it, reports in its favour. The name of Hieron's father is not given elsewhere.</p>

<p>Much of the cul is modern, also the upper part of one handle, and the spur of the other; both struts are modern, but the stumps must be ancient.</p>

<p>The type of kantharos is what Caskey has named 'A2' (<ref target="i.16" n="U">i pp. 16-17</ref>): it has bridges or struts, and spurs or thumb-rests; and the stem consists of two concave members meeting in a ridge. Struts appear before this in the Vlasto kantharos by Douris, one of his earliest works, but it has no spurs.<note anchored="true" n="iii.52.3"><p><title>ARV.1</title> p. 292 no. 196; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 445 no. 255.</p></note> None of the Attic black-figured kantharoi have struts, or none with struts have been preserved: but struts appear in some Boeotian kantharoi of the second quarter of the sixth century, and spurs in others: a kantharos in Copenhagen, Boeotian rather than Attic, although very close to Attic,<note anchored="true" n="iii.52.4"><p><title>CV.</title> pl. 98, 4.

<p>On A, Poseidon attacks the giant Polybotes, who, wounded in the right side, turns tail and falls on one knee, but looks round and tries to strike back with his sword. Both are 'infibulated', and naked, but Poseidon has a small wrap over his left arm. On the left arm he supports a mass of rock which represents the island of Nisyros, and the trident is in his right hand. His long hair is wreathed. The lower ends of it, with part of the collarbone, have disappeared in a fracture which passes through his beard and nose. The giant's hair escapes from below his Attic helmet in long strands. The edge of his shield rests on the ground, leaving his body exposed. The lips are parted. The right arm, as is shown by the incised sketch, was originally intended to be much farther forward.</p>

<p>On B, Dionysos attacks in almost the same attitude as Poseidon: he uses the butt of his thyrsus and darts a snake at the face of the giant, who shields himself and still grasps his sword, but turns and falls. Dionysos wears a short chiton of thickish material, with an apoptygma (rather than a flounce). His mane of hair is wreathed with ivy. The giant wears chitoniskos, leather corslet, and Attic helmet, from which long locks of hair pour over his shoulders.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown for the minor markings on the bodies, more plentiful on A than on B, and for the ancient, but very modern-looking, dabs which render the patterns on the chiton of Dionysos. The pupils are black, the corneae brown, rimmed with a relief-line. Red for the blood.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the groups. Dionysos often uses a serpent for a weapon in the Gigantomachy, and Poseidon often holds the island of Nisyros (which he snapped off with his trident from the island of Cos), ready to bring it down on his opponent. Pollak noticed that there was a certain resemblance between the Dionysos and Giant on our vase and on a contemporary cup-skyphos in the Bibliothèque Royale, Brussels, tentatively ascribed to the Painter of <rs key="Bologna 228" type="Vase">Bologna 228</rs>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.53.3"><p>Fröhner <title>Vases du Prince Napoléon</title> pl. 5 = Fröhner <title>Musées de France</title> pl. 6; Feytmans <title>Les Vases grecs de la Bibliothèque Royale</title> pll. 25-38. <title>ARV.1</title> p. 337, middle; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 513-14.</p></note></p>

<p>The cup is of Type C. The foot is slightly lipped.</p>

<p>Inside, a satyr runs with a drinking-horn and a wineskin. Relief contours here and throughout. Brown for the minor lines of the trunk. The wineskin is scumbled with brown. Red for the head-fillet and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S*P*X</foreign> retr. The border is a running maeander, broken by cross-squares. The 'odd man' is south-west.</p>

<p>Outside, on A, two women and a girl, naked. In the middle, under a tree, a woman, kneeling, holds out her hands to receive a chiton which another woman brings her. On the left a girl, with a pair of boots in one hand and a chiton in the other, walks away, <pb xml:id="iii.54" n="54"/> looking back. She has long hair, a necklace, and ear-rings. The hair of the women is bobbed. Red for the head-fillets and the leaves of the tree.</p>

<p>On the other half, a building is denoted by a Doric column with base, abacus, and (entablature?). In front of it a naked woman, bending, receives a himation from a fully dressed companion; behind the column a naked woman draws on boots. Her hair is like that of the two women on the other half; the woman in the middle has hers done up in a ball behind. Both have head-fillets. The third woman wears chiton, himation, ear-rings. The saccos, and the rolled himation in her hand, have embattled borders. The lower edge of her chiton is washed with brown, and there is a brown stripe at the level of mid-shank. The minor lines of the chiton-sleeve are in brown.

<p>The cup is of Type B. The potter-work is by Hieron, whose signature is incised on one handle, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*E*R*O*N*E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>. The foot belongs.</p>

<p>The cup was admirably published by Ludwig Pollak in 1900 (<title>Zwei vasen aus der Werkstatt Hierons</title> pp. 1-27). He also saw that the pictures were by the same hand as in the Eos cup (no. 155). Nearly all the vases with the signature of the potter Hieron were decorated by Makron, but two of the three latest are by a follower with a most distinctive style, whom, after this cup, we call the Telephos Painter. Brief characterizations of him are given in <title>VA</title>. pp. 107-8 and in <title>V. Pol.</title> pp. 38-39.</p>

<p>The story of Telephos was told in the <title>Cypria</title>, and later in plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, whose versions differed greatly, as is natural, in all but the main lines. The core of the story was this. The Greeks under Agamemnon, not knowing where Troy really was, landed by mistake in Mysia and proceeded to the attack. Telephos, the king, gave battle and beat them off, so that they were forced to return to Greece; but he himself was wounded by Achilles. The wound would not close and Telephos, consulting an oracle, was told that 'the wounder would heal', <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( trw/sas i)a/setai</foreign>. He therefore set out to find Achilles. Reaching Argos, he obtained admission to the palace of Agamemnon, where the Greek chiefs were gathered, but his identity was discovered and he had to flee for refuge to the altar in the courtyard. Thanks, it may be, to the seer Kalchas, to whom it was revealed that without the guidance of Telephos Troy could not be taken, his life was spared and Achilles agreed to heal the wound. This proved to be beyond his skill, until Odysseus perceived that by <foreign xml:lang="greek">o( trw/sas</foreign>, the wounder, the oracle meant not Achilles but Achilles' spear. The rust was therefore scraped off the spear-head and applied to the <pb xml:id="iii.55" n="55"/> wound, which healed. Telephos, in return, guided the Greeks to Troy. Probably the Greeks had learned, from oracle or prophet, that only a Greek could guide them; and Telephos had meanwhile turned out to be not a Mysian, but a Greek, son of Herakles. These are the outlines of the story: just how much was in the <title>Cypria</title> we cannot be sure.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>We now turn to the picture outside our cup.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the palace of Agamemnon: there are five figures in each half, and the composition is so arranged that each of the principal persons, Telephos and Agamemnon, is in the middle of one half. Agamemnon remains seated, but the other Greek heroes rush towards the intruder, and the foremost of them draws his sword, but is held back by a companion. Telephos, sitting on the altar, instead of facing his assailant turns round to an old man who hastens forward, extending an arm towards Telephos' shoulder, and calling out, surely, something so important that it takes the suppliant's attention from the immediate danger. The old man should be, as Pollak conjectures, Kalchas: who knows something, and has something to say. The hero drawing his sword, and his companion, must be Achilles and Patroklos: they were foremost, as Pindar tells us (<bibl n="Pind. O. 9">Pind. O. 9.80</bibl>), in the earlier part of the story, at the battle of the Kaikos in Mysia, and are naturally foremost here too. Pollak takes the impetuous hero who draws his sword to be Patroklos, but it is more probably Achilles, and Patroklos he who holds him back.</p>

<p>The painter has provided an architectural setting. On the left of A, the door of the palace is seen; one of the two door-panels is open and not shown; the other remains closed, and is shown together with meeting-stile and nail-studded rails. The upper of the two steps below it will be the threshold. The porch in front of the door is indicated by a slender Aeolic column, doubtless of wood, standing on a base: this may be either the column between the antae, or one of them; or rather, perhaps, one column of a prostyle porch. Compare the later and more detailed view of the porch and door on the onos by the Eretria Painter in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.55.1"><p><rs key="Athens 1629" type="Vase">Athens 1629</rs>: <title>Eph</title>. 1897 pll. 9-10, whence Pfuhl fig. 561; Dugas <title>Aison</title> fig. 14: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 726, no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 1250-1 no. 34.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Our column supports a thin entablature on which reglets are seen (or reglets with the lower parts of triglyphs?), and, between them, dots which make one think, though perhaps wrongly, of nail-heads or nail-holes. Above this epistyle one sees another architectural member which runs the whole length of A and is continued on B. This too is an entablature, with reglets (or reglets plus parts of triglyphs) and dots. At the right-hand corner of A it is seen to be supported by a column like the first, but having a plain abacus between it and the epistyle. On B there are two such columns: one, at the left edge of B, has the abacus; in the other, near the right edge, the part is lost. This structure is no doubt a cloister surrounding the courtyard in the middle of which the altar of Zeus Herkeios is set. The relation between cloister and door in the picture is not actual: the artist has juxtaposed the two.</p>

<p>There may be a further element of fancy in the architecture, but I am not prepared to assert it.</p>

<p>For the rendering of the reglets, compare the interior of our painter's cup in Toronto;<note anchored="true" n="iii.55.2"><p><rs key="Toronto 354" type="Vase">Toronto 354</rs>: Robinson and Harcum pl. 57: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 543 no. 15; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 818 no. 20.</p></note> for the capitals, one from Eresos published by Kondis.<note anchored="true" n="iii.55.3"><p><title>Annuario</title> 24-26 pp. 26-27.</p></note> It will be noticed that on B the figures are drawn on the hither side of the architecture, while on A the architecture is on the hither side of the figures.</p>

<p>On the left of A, behind Kalchas, a hero with a spear rushes out of the door into the courtyard. He is followed by two others, shown on B, one of them with a drawn sword, the other with a spear. Similarly, Achilles and Patroklos are followed, on B, by two heroes with spears. The second of them, a man, turns his head towards the seated Agamemnon, who is evidently saying to him, 'Go and see just what is the matter.' This must be Odysseus; and if we are to find a name for the hero in front of him, it will be Diomed. The other three heroes — on the left of A, and on the right of B — can hardly be named.</p>

<p>We pass to details. The altar is like those on nos. 155 and 157, and on the painter's cups in Munich and Goettingen.<note anchored="true" n="iii.55.4"><p><rs key="Munich 2669" type="Vase">Munich 2669</rs>: Gerhard <title>AV</title>. pl. 288-9, 9-12; Greifenhagen <title>Eroten</title> pp. 54-57: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 543 no. 16; <title>ARV</title> 2. no. 26. <rs key="Gttingen J. 33" type="Vase">Göttingen J. 33</rs>: Jacobsthal <title>Gött.

Telephos has been carrying a pair of javelins, and they still rest against his body. The artist has given him two right hands by mistake. His left thigh is bandaged, and there is blood on the bandage. He wears a chlamys, sandals, stockings, and a sheepskin hat of the sort that was often worn in Greece by peasants, workmen, hunters, and light-armed troops (see <ref target="ii.48" n="U">ii pp. 48-49 and 98</ref>; <rs key="Boston 10.185" type="Vase">Boston 10.185</rs> and <rs key="Boston 01.8085" type="Vase">Boston 01.8085</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.56.1"><p>It may perhaps be tempting to identify this hat with <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ pili/dion peri\ th\n kefalh\n to\ *Mu/sion</foreign> which according to Aristophanes formed part of Telephos's get-up in the play by Euripides (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 439">Aristoph. Ach. 439</bibl>), but the temptation should be resisted. According to Pollak the hat on our cup is 'essentially barbarian headgear', and he quotes the cup by the Pistoxenos Painter in the Faina collection (Hartwig pl. 38 and pl. 39, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 575 no. 11; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 861 no. 14 and p. 1672, where two of the barbarians among whom Herakles finds himself wear a similar hat. But the barbarians on the Faina cup are clad from head to foot in wool, and this is meant to characterize them as living in the cold North — whether they are Agathyrsi, as Hartwig conjectures, or Hyperboreans. A countryman of theirs appears, holding a phallus-stick, inside a fragmentary cup in the Louvre, <rs key="Louvre S 1420 plus" type="Vase">Louvre S 1420 plus</rs> , which is in the manner of the Antiphon Painter and may be from his hand; outside, A, pancration, B, hoplitodromoi: <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 345-6 no. 78.</p></note></p>

<p>Kalchas wears a long chiton as well as a himation, and moves with the help of a stick. Patroklos wears a chitoniskos (with kolpos), and a cloak shawlwise. Achilles, Odysseus, and Agamemnon wear a chitoniskos under the himation; Agamemnon has let his himation down to his waist. He holds a stick, sceptre, or spear, probably a spear — the top is missing. The other Greeks wear a himation only. Achilles has a headband of some kind; Agamemnon's head is bound with a broadish fillet. Patroklos and Odysseus wear piloi.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. No brown inner maskings on the bodies, or none to be seen now. Brown for Telephos' stockings, Kalchas's hair, the hilt of Achilles' sword and the unwhetted part of the blade. Red for the blood, the daubs on the altar, the sandals of Telephos, the loops of his javelins, the baldrick of Achilles, the pilos-cords.</p>

<p>Our picture, as Pollak observed, differs radically from all later representations of the episode. There Telephos has seized the infant Orestes and holds him as a hostage: this is the version used by Euripides in his <title>Telephos</title>, produced in 438 B.C.: but that it is older than Euripides is shown by a pelike in the British Museum which cannot be later than the middle of the fifth century,<note anchored="true" n="iii.56.2"><p><rs key="London E 382" type="Vase">London E 382</rs>: Pollak <title>Zwei Vasen</title> pl. 6: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 407, middle; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 632.</p></note> and a scholiast to Aristophanes (<bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 331">Aristoph. Ach. 331</bibl>) actually states that Aeschylus used the motive in his treatment of the legend. The Boston cup, as Pollak showed, follows the original version of the legend, as given in the <title>Cypria</title>, a version which did not contain the motive of the child-hostage.<note anchored="true" n="iii.56.3"><p>For Telephos and the infant Orestes see (besides Pollak) <title>EVP</title>. pp. 66 and 289, with what is quoted there; <title>JHS</title>. 69 p. 8; Metzger in <title>Rev. arch.</title> 1949 (<title>Mélanges Picard</title>) and <title>Représentations dans la céramique attique du IVe siècle</title> pp. 287-8.

<p>The picture inside the cup is also unique. A building is denoted by entablature, abacus, slender Aeolic column with base — in the same manner, then, as outside. Working on a larger scale, the artist has put a little more detail into the drawing of the column — the tie between the volutes, and a bud above them. The column divides the round into halves. On the right, a man sits on a rock in a dejected attitude, his feet together, his head bent, one hand covering his face. He wears travelling costume, chitoniskos, chlamys, petasos, but is unarmed. Another man stands facing him, with bent head, looking down at him. He is dressed like the first, but has a pilos instead of a petasos; and he is armed, holds a pair of spears against his shoulder. Both have one arm akimbo. The attitudes are expressive, and there is feeling in the picture. According to Pollak's suggestion, made tentatively, it is connected with the scene outside the cup: the men are Telephos and Teuthras.</p>

<p>Telephos, though king of Mysia, was son of Herakles: whether already in the <title>Cypria</title> is <pb xml:id="iii.57" n="57"/> uncertain, but already in the Hesiodic <title>Ehoiai (Pap. Oxyrh.</title> 1359 fr. 1; Evelyn White p. 606). How he came to be in Mysia was explained in various ways: in the <title>Mysoi</title> of Aeschylus it is clear that he had committed murder at home in Tegea and must flee the country; on consulting the oracle he was told to go to Mysia, where king Teuthras would purify him; and until he had been purified (according to the Greek rule, <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 452">Aesch. Eum. 452</bibl>) he must speak no word. Teuthras, in our picture, returning from the chase or from a journey — and so dressed as a traveller, not as a king at home — , finds Telephos in his house, perceives, from his attitude and his silence, what is amiss, pities him, performs the rite of cleansing, and in the end adopts him as his son and successor.</p>

<p>This interpretation, which is Pollak's, is not certain: but it fits the unusual attitudes and the unusual atmosphere, and may well be right.</p>

<p>There is another interpretation, however, which has long been in my mind and is possibly worth mention: Theseus and Perithoos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.57.1"><p>See <ref target="iii.70" n="U">iii p. 70</ref> (<rs key="Boston 99.539" type="Vase">Boston 99.539</rs>).</p></note> The building, the house of Hades: Theseus, freed by Herakles, will return to the light; Perithoos must stay.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown for the minor markings on the bodies. Red for the loops of the spears. This variety of maeander is a favourite with the painter; and several of his cups combine it with this particular form of saltire-square, for example, those in Leningrad, Tarquinia, Budapest.<note anchored="true" n="iii.57.2"><p><rs key="Leningrad 658" type="Vase">Leningrad 658</rs>: <title>ARV</title>. 1 p. 543 no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 817 no. 3. <rs key="Tarquinia 690" type="Vase">Tarquinia 690</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 21: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 543 no. 13; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 818 no. 17. Budapest: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 544 no. 26; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 819 no. 37.</p></note></p>

<p>According to Pollak the brown flecks on the rock-seat are vegetation (p. 20) — moss, then, or the like, which is quite possible. If the scene is in Hades, one thinks of dried blood, and of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)Axero/ntios sko/pelos ai(matostagh/s</foreign> in the <title>Frogs</title> (<bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 471">Aristoph. Frogs 471</bibl>): but this is not to be pressed.</p>

<p>Lastly, Pollak says that one cannot tell whether the seated man was bearded or not: enough remains to show that he was bearded.</p>

<p>Diameter 0.328. The foot is alien. First heard of in the possession of the Roman dealer Basseggio, who sold it to Schlosser in the winter 1835-6.

About 470-460 B.C., by the Telephos Painter (<title>VA</title>. p. 108 no. 1; <title>Att. V.</title> p. 225 no. 1; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 542 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 816-17 no. 1).</p>

<p>The cup, of Type B, bears the signature of Hieron as potter, incised on one handle, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*I*E*R*O*N*E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>. (It is placed on the wrong handle in the drawing published by Hartwig.) Pollak saw that the pictures were by the same hand as those on the Telephos cup, no. 154.</p>

<p>In 1933 I added a fragment in Florence and four (making up into three) in Villa Giulia (<title>CF</title>. pl. 11 B 44 and pl. Y, 5-8, with pp. 18-19); Miss Chapman has incorporated them in her drawings.</p>

<p>Inside, Eos, alighting, seizes a boy, who looks round in surprise. She wears a chiton, with kolpos, a small wrap shawl-wise over her shoulders, a spotted saccos, and ear-rings; the boy has a himation over his shoulders. His long hair is tucked up behind into a headband or thin stephane, with a pair of locks escaping one on each side of the ear. Relief contours. Brown for the minor details of the wings and of the boy's body, also for the pair of stripes on the skirt. The lower edge of the skirt is bordered with brown, like the edge of <pb xml:id="iii.58" n="58"/> Achilles' himation on the Telephos cup (no. 154). The forehead-hair of the goddess is in dark brown dots on a lighter ground. Red for her girdle and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The maeander is of the same type as in the Telephos cup (no. 154); the saltire-squares are different, but recur in other cups by the Telephos Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.58.1"><p><rs key="Louvre G 385-6" type="Vase">Louvre G 385-6</rs>: <title>VA</title>. p. 108; Pottier pl. 40: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 542 no. 6; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 817 no. 4. <rs key="Florence PD 54" type="Vase">Florence PD 54</rs>: <title>NSc</title>. 1926 pp. 368-9: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 543 no. 23; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 819 no. 36.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The goddess is Eos; and the boy is surely Tithonos. There are cases where one might hesitate between Tithonos and Kephalos (see <ref target="ii.37" n="U">ii pp. 37-38</ref>; <rs key="Boston 03.816" type="Vase">Boston 03.816</rs>), but this is not among them: physique, attitude, and costume, speak for Tithonos.</p>

<p>Outside, the picture runs right round the cup. A strange, excited procession of ten persons is headed by a man in armour who sets one foot on a perpendicular mountain or rock and looks up. His left leg is shown frontal. He wears a chitoniskos (with kolpos), a wrap over his shoulders, an Attic helmet, greaves, and sword; holds a spear, upright, in his right hand, and on his left arm a shield. The device on his shield is a prancing horse — lean, like the human figures — , of which only the forepart is shown. The movable cheek-piece of the helmet is ornamented with a snake, the scabbard with roundels or bosses. He is followed by (2) an old man, (3) a man, (4) a youth, (5) a man, (6) a youth or man — the upper part is missing — , (7) an elderly man, (8) a youth, (9) an aged man, doubtless a servant, (10) a man. All wear himatia; (2) the old man, and (7) the elderly, a long chiton as well. All carry sticks, except the youth (8). (2), (5), and (7) have thin head-fillets of the simplest sort, done in red; 3, a broader fillet, reserved; 4 and 10, broad fillets — tainiai; and the youth (8) a stephane with leaves rising from it in front. The aged man who with difficulty follows him has no head-fillet. Over his shoulder he carries a large string-bag containing round things — fruit? or vegetables? — , and besides the bag, a strigil and a flat-bottomed aryballos. He would seem to be the servant of the youth no. 8, and the elderly man no. 7, who looks back at the youth, may be the father. His scanty hair appears to be tied on the forehead in a fashion which we have already encountered (<ref target="iii.34" n="U">iii p. 34</ref>; <rs key="Boston 13.186" type="Vase">Boston 13.186</rs>). He shows no wrinkles, and is evidently younger than no. 2.</p>

<p>Three of these persons look up, like the armed leader, and two of them — the old man no. 2, and the youth no. 8 — open their mouths.</p>

<p>The procession passes a lighted altar, under one handle; and between the last two figures a tree is seen. The altar is of the same type as in the Telephos cup (no. 154).</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details of the bodies and for the netting. A brown streak indicates the rotundity of the shield, and there is much brown on rock and tree. The chiton of 7, the himatia of 2, 7, and 5, have the same brown edging as the chiton of Eos. Red for the thin fillets, for the baldrick, the flame, the daubs on the altar, and the cords of the aryballos.</p>

<p>The new fragments improve the lower parts of Eos, and of 1, 5, 6 outside; also the altar and the rock. There are still pieces wanting. A very small fragment in Villa Giulia, with fingers holding the top of a stick, seemed to be by the Telephos Painter and may be the missing part of 7: but my notes are insufficient.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>This is the point at which a convincing interpretation of the picture should follow, but all we can produce is a brief account of the explanations hitherto suggested.</p>

<p>Emil Braun in 1837 (<title>Annali</title> 1837 pp. 209-18): — Oedipus setting out to cope with the Sphinx; and the terrified population of Thebes.</p>

<p>Dümmler in 1899 (<title>Bonner Studien</title> p. 89): 'chorus of Thebans congratulating Oedipus on his victory over the Sphinx'.</p>

<p>Van Branteghem in 1888 (Fröhner <title>Burl</title>. 1888 p. 3): 'the family of Tithonos, who are present at his abduction and look towards the sky with gestures of fear and surprise. At the time when the young shepherd is carried off by Eos, a sacrifice is being celebrated.' (It had already occurred to Braun that the outside picture might be connected with the inside — 'companions of Kephalos' — but he had rejected the thought.)</p>

<p>Hartwig in 1893 (<title>Meisterschalen</title> pp. 436-7): the altar merely denotes the neighbourhood of a sanctuary; a number of ordinary Athenians who happen to be at the foot of a mountain witness the abduction of Kephalos above.</p>

<p>Petersen in 1917 (<title>Jb</title>. 32 pp. 137-45): celebration of the festival, commemorating the <pb xml:id="iii.59" n="59"/> capture of Salamis by the Athenians from the Megarians, which is described by Plutarch (<bibl n="Plut. Sol. 9">Plut. Sol. 9</bibl>), who states that on this occasion an armed man landed from a ship and ran to Mount Skiradion; the altar of Enyalios set up by Solon. (This explanation has the merit of explaining the man in armour, but as expounded by Petersen it is rather complicated.)</p>

<p>Bicknell in 1921 (<title>JHS</title>. 41 pp. 229-30): hunting-companions of Kephalos; the string-bag a hunting-net.</p>

<p>Pfuhl in 1923 (<title>MZ</title>. p. 475): against Petersen.</p>

<p>Deubner in 1932 (<title>Attische Feste</title> p. 219): for Petersen.</p>

<p>Becatti in 1952 (<title>Arch. class.</title> 4 pp. 162-73): the descendants of Kephalos return to Athens, as Pausanias relates (<bibl n="Paus. 1.37">Paus. 1.37.6-7</bibl>), in the tenth generation after the banishment of their ancestor; arriving at Mount Poikilon, they sight the serpent which is a sign that they have reached the spot where Apollo at Delphi had instructed them to sacrifice; the armed leader is Chalkinos; the boy on B, Daitos.</p>

<p>The most obvious explanation is a search party: if it is oddly composed, — the artist is an odd character. But the <emph>true</emph> explanation may be still to find.</p>

<p>Inside, an athlete, still dressed in his himation, stands, looking round, with an acontion in his hand. In front of him a laver, on a base; behind him a pillar. Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details of the body. Red for the head-fillet, the loop of the acontion, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*S</foreign>. The 'odd man' of the maeander is a little west of south.</p>

<p>Outside, three figures on each half. On A, a jumper, with halt&emacr;res, in the middle; a young trainer, holding out his wand towards him, on the right; and on the left an acontist. Between acontist and jumper, sponge, strigil, and aryballos, hanging by a thong from a peg; between jumper and trainer, a pillar. On B, an acontist in the middle, a discus-thrower on the left, a jumper on the right. Between the discus-thrower and the acontist, the same sponge, strigil, aryballos, as on A; between the acontist and the jumper a fluted pillar; behind the jumper a pick. Under each handle a rough stone seat. A large ivy-leaf springs from each handle-root, as often in early classic cups. The technique as within. Red for the trainer's head-fillet, the loops of the acontia, the cords of the sponges, and the letters, without meaning, strown over the field.</p>

<p>Diameter 0.227, height 0.096. From the Roman market. I Dionysos; A-B, maenads and satyrs. About 470-460 B.C., by the Telephos Painter (<title>Att. V.</title> p. 226 no. 25; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 544 no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 819 no. 44).</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B.</p>

<p>Inside, Dionysos moves to right, looking round, holding a thyrsus in his right hand, and a panther-cub by the hind-legs in his left. He wears a long chiton, a panther-skin over it, and an ivy-wreath; the hair is tied near the ends behind. On the left, a lighted altar, of the same kind as in nos. 154 and 155. On the right a floating flower. Relief-contours. Brown for the double stripe on the skirt, for details of the pelt, and for the daub on the altar. Red for wreath, flame, and the inscription <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*O*I</foreign>. The maeander is stopped, but breaks into a run below the feet of the god.</p>

<p>Outside, on A, a satyr drops his thyrsus and rushes after a maenad, who turns and threatens him with her thyrsus; another maenad dances, with wing-sleeves (see <ref target="ii.40" n="U">ii p. 40</ref>; <rs key="Boston 01.8028" type="Vase">Boston 01.8028</rs>); on B, two maenads dance, and a satyr plays the flute. Satyrs and maenads wear panther-skins, the maenads chitons with kolpoi. The left-hand maenad on A seems to have a second kolpos, above the other; the right-hand maenad on B has a flounce. Her hair is in a saccos. The right-hand maenad on B has also her hair in a saccos, of a different sort. Both wear ear-rings. The other maenads have bare heads with shortish flying hair. They and the satyrs wear ivy-wreaths. A wineskin hangs in the field on A — unless it has been dropped by the satyr and is falling. On B, a thyrsus leans or falls. There is a floating flower on B like that inside the cup; and a third such flower springs from the root of one handle. What answers to this flower at the other handle is a pair of large ivy-leaves, one from each handle-root, like those on no. 153. There is also a floating palmette under each handle. Relief-contours. Red for the wreaths, for the leaves of the thyrsus-branches on B, and for the meagre inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*O*S*L*E*S*S</foreign>, meaningless, over the two right-hand figures on A: the fifth character is complete, but indeterminate.</p>

<p>The fragment that gives the upper part of the right-hand maenad on A was formerly in the University of Leipsic, was added (on paper) in <title>CF</title>. p. 34 no. 25, and acquired by Boston shortly after. A small piece of chiton and pelt is still missing, also a little of the pursuer's middle, and a few of the spots on his pelt.</p>

<p>The shape and the shoulder-decoration are of standard type.</p>

<p>A woman stoops at a wool-basket, with a flower in her hand, as if dropping it in. Above, a distaff hangs, full of wool. The woman wears chiton, himation, ear-rings; her hair is rolled up behind.

<p>Height 0.48, diameter 0.49. Iliupersis. About 470-460 B.C., by the Altamura Painter (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 590 no. 11). <title>Illustrated London News</title> 10 Oct. 1959 pp. 398-9 (Vermeule); part of A, <title>The Listener</title> 19 Jan. 1961 p. 131. The Sack of Troy.</p>

<p>The figure-work runs right round the vase, and the theme is the Sack of Troy. There are twelve large figures, in four groups: one group on B, the three others on A and in the areas of the handles. On the front of the vase there is much overlapping — the thick of the conflict; on the back of the vase, the composition is more open — outskirts, escape. In the middle of A, two figures — Neoptolemos and Priam; on the right of A, and in the handle-area to right of it, two figures — a Greek warrior and a Trojan, in combat; on the left of A, and in the handle-zone to left of it, four figures — Ajax the Less and Cassandra; on B, four figures — Aeneas and Anchises.</p>
<div>
<head>I. Neoptolemos and Priam</head>
<p>Priam has fled to the altar of Zeus Herkeios in the courtyard of his palace. He sits on the altar, or rather staggers back on to it, supporting himself on the sceptre held in his left hand, and extending his right arm as if to ward off the attack. The lips are parted. Hair and beard are white — the white colour not perfectly preserved. He wears a chiton of thick wool, bordered, and fringed at the ankles; over it, a himation. The folds of the chiton are in brown lines, and brown the pattern on it. The figure of the young Neoptolemos dominates the picture: he strides forward, shield on left arm, right hand raised holding the child Astyanax by one leg. The motive is traditional in this scene, Astyanax used as a sort of weapon, the oldest and the youngest of the royal house brought together in destruction.<note anchored="true" n="iii.61.4"><p>Robert <title>Heldensage</title> p. 1263; Kunze in <title>G.G.A.</title> 199 pp. 296-7.</p></note> Neoptolemos wears a chitoniskos, a corslet with metal enhancements, and a helmet of Attic type. The caul of the helmet has a lozenge pattern, the cheek-piece is black, the nasal plain, the frontlet moulded into the likeness of curls, the nape-piece ornamented (as in the other Attic helmets on this vase) with a black pellet. The lozenge-pattern indicates a cloth covering, glued to the metal, against the heat of the sun. The hair falls down behind in long ringlets, and another mass of ringlets escapes from under the cheek-piece. A left hand is drawn instead of a right hand, as not infrequently on vases.</p>

<p>The figures of Neoptolemos and Priam, to judge from Priam's gesture, should be farther apart, but the artist has pressed them together for his own purpose.</p>
<pb xml:id="iii.62" n="62"/>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/></div>
<div>
<head>II. Combat</head>
<p>One warrior — a Greek — attacks with the spear, the other — a Trojan — gives ground but looks back and draws his sword. Both men are bearded. Both wear chitoniskos and leather corslet; the Greek has an Attic helmet, the Trojan's helmet is of the so-called 'Thracian type'<note anchored="true" n="iii.62.1"><p><title>Jahrbuch</title> 27 pp. 317-44 (Bruno Schröder).</p></note> The Greek bears a shield, with an apron attached to it. The Trojan has neither shield nor spear. His sword is the only sword on the vase.</p></div>
<div>
<head>III. Ajax and Cassandra</head>
<p>Cassandra, naked, with hair dishevelled, has fallen on her knees at the image of Athena and embraced it with both arms; Ajax grasps her left arm to drag her away. (Her right arm and hand are seen on the left, still clinging to the image.) Ajax has his shield on his left arm and his spear in his left hand. He wears a chitoniskos, a corslet which is specially like that of the Trojan warrior in the combat-group, and a helmet of Attic type. The caul of the helmet is ornamented with a tendril and a bud, the cheek-piece with a snake, the lower parts of the corslet shoulder-flaps with lions. The image of Athena, set on a low base, is seen from the front and is characterized as of very early style: the figure bolt upright, the feet close together, the two sides of the body almost exactly alike; the dress is a peplos, with a flounce forming a double thickness over the breast; fringe below, borders, mid-band, girdle tied quite loosely so that there is no waist. The hair is parted in the middle and plastered down towards the ears. The rendering of the close-fitting helmet is not borrowed from early statues, but from early <emph>representations</emph> of helmeted heads in front view: the crest drawn as if it had two ends and the helmet as if it had two neck-pieces. A transverse crest is of course possible, but not a double neck-piece. Shield on left arm, spear in the raised right hand.</p>

<p>In point of composition, a fourth figure belongs to the Cassandra group, although it has no special connexion with the subject. A young girl, a servant, moves away, past the image, looking round, her right hand grasping her hair in a gesture of alarm, a box in her left hand. The hair is bobbed; the costume is a chiton with flounce and kolpos. The box may contain jewellery: from the wreck she is trying to save something. Similar figures, as will be seen later, occur in other pictures of the Iliupersis.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/></div>
<div>
<head>IV. Aeneas and Anchises</head>
<p>The drawing on the back of the vase is much less detailed than on the front. Aeneas, stooping, moves forward, carrying Anchises. Anchises, with white hair and beard, grasps his stick and looks round. The wife of Aeneas follows, and a young warrior precedes. Both warriors wear chitoniskos, leather corslet, and Attic helmet. Aeneas has neither shield nor spear; the young man has both, the shield-device a serpent. Anchises wears a chiton and a himation. The fingers of his right hand are thrust under the himation at the chest. The woman wears a chiton, and a himation wrapped round her, covering both arms; ampyx, small hair-bag; ear-ring indicated by a black dot. The lower edge of the himation is in brown, and so are the lines of the hair-bag.</p>

<p>The scabbard of the Trojan in the combat group overlaps the female figure of the Aeneas group, and we must consider whether the two warriors whom we called the right-hand group on A may not really belong in subject to the group on B: the Trojan warrior being the rear-guard of Aeneas. I think this unlikely: in technique the combat group goes with those on the front of the vase: it is carried out fully, with relief-contours, whereas the drawing of the Aeneas group is in an altogether slighter manner, with little or no relief-contour. Moreover, other Iliupersis vases, as will be seen, have a combat group which is not the same as ours, but in some degree corresponds to it.</p></div>
<div>
<p>Two of the inscriptions make sense, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*A*S</foreign>, retr., on A, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*I*N*E*A</foreign> on B, but the others are meaningless; — <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*O*N*I*O*L</foreign> above the head of Priam; <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S*O*T*N</foreign> to left of the woman on B; to right of her, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*O*L*D*L</foreign>, all the letters very rough and uncertain.<note anchored="true" n="iii.62.2"><p>Miss Palmer and Miss Chapman have kindly checked my readings of the inscriptions.</p></note></p>

<p>The floral pattern above the picture, a design of red-figure palmettes lying on their sides, is often used in this place on the more elaborate calyx-kraters, not only by artists <pb xml:id="iii.63" n="63"/> of the Altamura Painter's group but by others as well. Below the pictures, a band of stopt maeander, varied by pattern-squares that touch the lower bounding-line but not the upper: three cross-squares and a saltire-square on A, one cross-square on B.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The two fateful acts of sacrilege, the murder of Priam and the assault upon Cassandra, are coupled, or at least juxtaposed, on other vases besides ours: on a cup of about 500 B.C. in Athens, on the Vivenzio hydria by the Kleophrades Painter in Naples, on a volute-krater of about 400 B.C. in Ferrara, and, more obscurely, on the volute-krater by the Niobid Painter in Bologna; but most like our vase, in this respect, is a far earlier one, the black-figured amphora signed by Lydos, in the Louvre, where the picture on one side consists of two scenes: on the right, Neoptolemos, with Astyanax, and Priam; on the left, Ajax attacking Cassandra who clings to the image of Athena: the date should be before the middle of the sixth century.<note anchored="true" n="iii.63.1"><p><rs key="Athens, Acr. 212" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 212</rs> (Langlotz pl. 10; with new fragments, <title>Hesp</title>. 5 p. 257). <rs key="Naples 2422" type="Vase">Naples 2422</rs> (FR. pl. 34, whence Pfuhl fig. 378 and <title>Kleophrades-Maler</title> pl. 27: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 126 no. 66; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 189 no. 74). <rs key="Ferrara T. 136A VP" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 136A VP</rs> (<title>Riv.

Miss Brann has shown that it may be figured on a very late geometric fragment (loc. cit. pl. 17, 1); the analogy of the lekanis in Naples (see footnote 3) makes one think that the figures on the right may be Hecuba and Priam.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The certain examples begin in the first quarter of the sixth century with the pediment of the Temple of Artemis in Corcyra. As early as the second quarter, the deaths of Priam and Astyanax are combined, for example on the lekanis by the C Painter in Naples.<note anchored="true" n="iii.63.3"><p><title>RM</title>. 27 pll. 5-6; <title>ML</title>. 22 pl. 57: <title>ABV</title>. p. 58 no. 119.</p></note></p>

<p>The two Iliupersis vases that are nearest to ours are early works of the Niobid Painter, who was a younger colleague of the Altamura: a volute-krater in Bologna, a calyx-krater in Ferrara.<note anchored="true" n="iii.63.4"><p><rs key="Bologna 268" type="Vase">Bologna 268</rs> (see footnote 1); Ferrara, <rs key="Ferrara T. 936" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 936</rs> (A, Aurigemma.1 p. 177 = 2 p. 235; A, Alfieri and Arias <title>Spina</title> pll. 37-39); see also <ref target="iii.65" n="U">iii p. 65</ref> footnote 4 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 59.178" type="Vase">Boston 59.178</rs>).</p></note> On the Bologna vase, the group of Neoptolemos, Priam, and Astyanax has much in common with ours. The Cassandra incident is treated differently, but the image of Athena is very like ours. The figure of the young girl is also there, but attached to the Priam group instead of to the Cassandra, and carrying not a box but a pair of phialai and a small bag of holdall shape. There are also two warriors in combat, a Greek and a Trojan, but both fully armed, and arranged so as to confront each other, one on each side of the Priam group. The Ferrara vase is farther from ours than the Bologna, but the group of Neoptolemos and Priam is again similar, although there is no Astyanax. The young girl also appears, carrying a pair of phialai, and, on her head, a shallow basket — rather than a box (this part of the vase is damaged). The scene is flanked by two warriors in combat, as on the Bologna vase; and Aeneas carrying his father is one of the two other episodes depicted.</p>

<p>Two small fragments, from Locri, in Reggio, come from another fine Iliupersis vase, a calyx-krater by the Niobid Painter or from his immediate neighbourhood.<note anchored="true" n="iii.63.5"><p><title>ARV.2</title> p. 609 no. 6 bis.</p></note> On one fragment, the raised forearm, probably of a warrior attacking; and the upper half of a girl's head, in a saccos, to right; she was probably moving to right, and looking round, like the corresponding figures on the vases just described.

<p>A figure of a young girl fleeing completes the Cassandra scene on two later vases (third <pb xml:id="iii.64" n="64"/> quarter of the fifth century), the neck-amphora from the Group of Polygnotos in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where she holds a box on her head, and the cup by the Marlay Painter in Ferrara, where she holds a box and a pyxis.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.1"><p>Corpus Christi College, see footnote 8; Ferrara, <rs key="Ferrara T. 264" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 264</rs> (<title>Riv.

In the picture of Menelaos pursuing Helen, at the fall of Troy, on a hydria in the Torlonia collection (Noël Des Vergers pl. 39, whence Ghali-Kahil <title>Hélène</title> pl. 57, 2) a girl carries not a basket, but a holdall: for this object see <ref target="ii.79" n="U">ii p. 79</ref> (<rs key="Boston 33.56" type="Vase">Boston 33.56</rs>), and that carried by an old slave-woman on the Locrian relief in Reggio published by Mrs. Zancari Montuoro (<title>Arch.

Hard to explain, the figure of a woman fleeing, box in hand, on the tripod-pyxis by Douris in Mannheim (<title>CV</title>. pl. 26, 124): at first glance one thinks of Menelaos and Helen, but this can hardly be Helen, or the warrior Menelaos.</p></note></p>

<p>The story of Ajax the Less — the wrong Ajax — and Cassandra was related, like that of Priam and Neoptolemos, in the <title>Iliupersis</title> attributed to Arktinos. The representations have been studied recently by Schefold, by Miss Davreux, by Kunze, and by Arias.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.2"><p>Schefold in <title>Jahrbuch</title> 52 pp. 41-45; Davreux <title>La Légende de la prophétesse Cassandre</title> (many useful illustrations; peculiar dates, &amp;c.); Kunze <title>Archaische Schildbänder</title> pp. 161-3; Arias in <title>Riv Ist.</title> N.S. 4 pp. 109-14 and 166-9 (the references to <title>ABV</title>. on pp. 166-7 should be checked by the subject-index to <title>ABV</title>.) Kunze's brief exposition of the earlier figurations is admirable. There is a spirited picture of the subject on an Etruscan amphora of the Praxias Group in the British Museum.</p></note> Miss Davreux distinguished two types: that in which the figure of Athena represents the goddess herself, intervening to protect Cassandra; and that in which it represents not the goddess herself but her image. Arias follows Miss Davreux.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.3"><p>Davreux pp. 139-51. Arias loc. cit. p. 113.</p></note> Schefold, in his valuable essay on representations of statues, had not made the distinction in so many words, but he does state that in the early pictures of Ajax and Cassandra 'it is meaningless to ask whether the figure of Athena is intended to depict a statue or the goddess herself'.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.4"><p><title>Jb</title>. 52 p. 41. He also states (ibid. p. 41) that 'the red-figure painters are the first to see the Palladion to which Cassandra flees, consciously as a statue'. I cannot believe that the artists of the shield-band reliefs (Kunze <title>Archaische Schildbänder</title> pl. 7, pl. 18, pl. 56), or of the Attic cup <rs key="London B 379" type="Vase">London B 379</rs> (<title>JHS</title>. 5 pl. 42; <title>CV</title>. III Hg pl. 82; Davreux pl. 24 fig. 44: <title>ABV</title>. p. 60 no. 20, manner of the C Painter) were unaware that they were representing statues.</p></note> In spite of this warning I propose to ask the question and to answer it: the figure of Athena always depicts a statue. If Athena herself had attacked the son of Oileus that would have been the end of him at once: she preferred to bide her time. The artists were well aware of this.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The representations of Ajax and Cassandra begin in the first half of the sixth century,<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.5"><p>In the second half of the seventh century according to Arias (loc. cit. p. 113), but I do not know to which objects he refers.</p></note> and the development may be summarized as follows. At first the figure of Athena stands bolt upright, holding shield and raised spear, but with the feet close together, not in a fighting attitude; and this attitude persists into early red-figure;<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.6"><p>Plate by the Cerberus Painter, <rs key="Yale 169" type="Vase">Yale 169</rs> (<title>V.A.</title> p. 13; Baur pl. 15).</p></note> but in Attic black-figure from the third quarter of the sixth century onwards, and in archaic Attic red-figure, it is usually replaced by the fighting, 'Promachos', 'Panathenaic' attitude with one leg set well forward. About 480, the Cleophrades Painter, on the Vivenzio hydria,<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.7"><p>See <ref target="iii.63" n="U">iii p. 63</ref> footnote 1 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 59.178" type="Vase">Boston 59.178</rs>).</p></note> characterizes the figure as an old-fashioned image: it stands on a base; one foot is but slightly advanced; the drapery is foldless; and the face has an archaic rigour and an archaic smile. The next step is taken in the early classic period: the Altamura Painter and others continue this characterization in a different form: stressing it by turning the figure towards the spectator, in front view. The contrast between the mortals in strong action and the frontal statue, hieratic and frozen, remains a favourite motive in the fourth century. In the third quarter of the fifth century and later, the goddess herself is sometimes shown as well as her image: first on the neck-amphora from the Group of Polygnotos in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.8"><p>Fröhner <title>Coll. B</title> [<emph>arre</emph>] pl. 6 no. 330, whence <title>Riv. Ist.</title> N.S. 4 p. 111 fig. 18: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 700 no. 82; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1058 no. 114.</p></note></p>

<p>In the earlier representations, Cassandra is naked; and in the later she is sometimes fully dressed but more often naked or scantily clad. Two explanations of this nudity have been given: Furtwängler's, that the significance is 'erotic'; and Robert's, that this is the 'ritual nudity of a prophetess'. Furtwängler's explanation is certainly to be preferred: the intention of Ajax was to ravish: which by no means implies that in the epic or to the artist he was able to carry out his intention.<note anchored="true" n="iii.64.9"><p>Kunze <title>Archaische Schildbänder</title> p. 162.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<pb xml:id="iii.65" n="65"/>
<p>In the early representations, and even as late as the Cerberus Painter, the figure of Cassandra is very small. By this the artist wishes to indicate that the statue of Athena is very large.<note anchored="true" n="iii.65.1"><p>For other explanations, incorrect to my mind, see Davreux pp. 142-3.</p></note> He uses two scales: one for the image and Cassandra, the other for Ajax. Similarly, even at the very end of the archaic period, the Foundry Painter, on his name-piece in Berlin, uses two scales: one for the colossal statue and the two workmen who are giving it the final touches; the other for the two men in authority who are looking on.<note anchored="true" n="iii.65.2"><p><rs key="Berlin 2294" type="Vase">Berlin 2294</rs>: FR. pl. 135; <title>CV</title>. pll. 72-3, pl. 76, 4, pl. 126, 5; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 263 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 400-1 no. 1.</p></note></p>

<p>The Cassandra of our vase is a big woman, stark, and by archaic standards lanky: a contrast to the taut Cassandra of the Kleophrades Painter, and sister to the Amazon of the Penthesilea Painter on his contemporary name-piece in Munich (<rs key="Munich 2688" type="Vase">Munich 2688</rs>).</p>

<p><title>Aeneas carrying his father</title> is quite a popular subject with Attic black-figure vase-painters from the third quarter of the sixth century onwards, but the red-figure examples are few, and ours is one of the latest;<note anchored="true" n="iii.65.3"><p>A full list of representations is given by Schauenburg in <title>Gymnasium</title> 67, 176-91.

The white lekythos by the Brygos Painter in Gela, contemporary with the Vivenzio hydria, has Aeneas and Anchises, but Aeneas leads his father instead of carrying or hoisting him.<note anchored="true" n="iii.65.5"><p>Vivenzio hydria: see <ref target="iii.63" n="U">iii p. 63</ref> footnote 1 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 59.178" type="Vase">Boston 59.178</rs>).

<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In some pictures of Aeneas and Anchises, it might be questioned whether the woman accompanying the pair was the wife of the hero, or Aphrodite: here there can be no doubt.<note anchored="true" n="iii.65.6"><p>Another vase where the woman is certainly the wife of Aeneas is the Etruscan amphora of the Praxias Group in Munich (<rs key="Munich 3185" type="Vase">Munich 3185</rs>: Gerhard pl. 217: <title>Jb</title>. 43 p. 345 fig. 13-14: <title>EVP</title>. p. 195 no. 3).</p></note></p>

<p>The Altamura Painter is not a subtle artist, but in his best works, of which this is one, he achieves a certain grandeur.</p></div>

<p>On the front of the vase, Nike is preparing a trophy. The tree-stump has already been dressed with a chitoniskos, a leather corslet, and a Corinthian helmet; a sword has been slung round the corslet, and the spear has been temporarily fixed, one is not shown how, with point downward; the shield, charged with an eye, still leans against the trunk. The rectangles to right of the shoulder-piece must be the cross-piece of the stump. Nike is boring a hole in the stump, with an auger or the like, preparatory to fastening the helmet on with a nail. She wears a peplos with a long apoptygma, overgirt. The skirt clings rather close to the legs, with a 'hobble' look, as if it were tucked into the girdle, on the off side, against flapping during the work. Many of the folds were drawn in thin brown lines before the relief-lines were applied. The coverts have brown details, and the helmet is scumbled with brown. The contours are in relief-lines. Red or white for the cord passing thrice round the hair.</p>

<p>On the back of the vase, a youth in a himation, with a stick, watches the scene. No relief-contours. The edge of the himation is brown. Red or white for the thin head-fillet.</p>
<pb xml:id="iii.66" n="66"/>
<p>Under each handle there is a small palmette, point downward, without any relief-lines.</p>

<p>The handles are ridged. The foot is a near-torus, narrowing slightly downwards. There is no base-fillet. The shape is much as in the small pelikai by the Achilles Painter, the Dwarf Painter (for instance, above, <ref target="no.59" n="U">i, no. 59</ref>), the Phiale Painter (for instance, above, <ref target="no.63" n="U">i, no. 63</ref>). The pattern-work, and the small palmette under each handle, are the same as there. The patterns are in the Achillean tradition, which continues the tradition of the Berlin Painter: on the reverse, key-pattern; on the obverse, sets of maeander facing alternatively left and right, separated by pattern-squares which alternately join the lower and the upper bounding-line. The rather niggling style of the figure-work has nothing to do with any of those painters.</p>

<p>Diameter 0.226, height 0.087. Formerly in the possession of Alessandro Castellani (<title>Notice</title>, 1865, p. 32 no. 49; <title>Cat. 1866</title> no. 109), later in the Paravey collection (sale cat. 1879 no. 90: 'from Magna Graecia'). A-B, <title>Coll. du Dr. B. et de M. C.</title>, <title>Paris 19-21 mars 1910</title> pl. 21 no. 182. I, youth; A-B, youths and women. About 430-425 B.C., by the Calliope Painter (<title>Att. V.</title> p. 427 no. 7; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 734 no. 12; <title>ARV.2</title>. no. 11).</p>

<p>The cup is of Type B.</p>

<p>Inside, on an exergue, a youth in a himation stands with both legs frontal, head to left, holding out a small object — fruit? egg ? — in his right hand; on the left, a plain block; on the right, hanging, a bag. No relief-contour. White for the wreath, the 'egg', the strings fastening the bag. The maeander border is in fives, interrupted by cross-squares; there are seven maeanders on the right instead of five, and the artist probably began the border south-east, with the cup held upside down in respect to the figure.</p>

<p>Bags of this form, <foreign xml:lang="greek">formi/skoi</foreign>, were used to contain astragaloi: at least that was one of their purposes.<note anchored="true" n="iii.67.2"><p>See Greifenhagen in <title>Anz</title>. 1935 pp. 484-7, in <title>Anz</title>. 1936 pp. 405-6 and in <title>CV</title>. Mannheim 1 p. 25 on pl. 11, 9 and Beil. B2.</p></note></p>

<p>It ought to be possible to say what the white oval is, but it is not so easy. In the tondo of a cup by the Calliope Painter in the Jatta collection at Ruvo,<note anchored="true" n="iii.67.3"><p><rs key="Ruvo 1448" type="Vase">Ruvo 1448</rs>: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 734 no. 9; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1261 no. 54.</p></note> a satyr, respectably dressed in a himation, with a stick, stands frontal, head to left; to left of him is a block like that in our picture, and lying on it a white object which is more like a fruit than an egg. If the blocks are plain altars the objects might be lumps of incense.</p>

<p>Outside, in each half, three figures. On one half, a youth in a himation which he holds out with his right hand, leaving his chest exposed, whether drawing the garment on or letting it down, stands between two women who look towards him. The woman before him stands frontal, the woman behind him is seen from the back. She too holds out her himation, drawing it about her with her left hand. Both women wear a chiton under the himation. The hair is gathered up into a chignon, with a reserved band round the head. Three things are seen hanging: a bag like that inside; a writing-case; and a larger bag of hold-all type patterned with zigzags (really net-pattern) and rows of spots, which reappears on a cup-fragment by the Calliope Painter in Adria.<note anchored="true" n="iii.67.4"><p><rs key="Adria B 319" type="Vase">Adria B 319</rs>: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 735 no. 37; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1260 no. 35.</p></note> The writing-case is fastened by a brown cord passing three times round it, and also by white cords: so also in a cup-fragment by our painter in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.67.5"><p><rs key="Athens, Acr. 409" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 409</rs>: Langlotz pl. 31: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 734 no. 18; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1260 no. 23.</p></note></p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>On the other half, a woman standing in the middle offers a wreath to a youth who faces her, his hand on his stick. Behind her, another youth is seen in back view, looking round towards the pair and extending his forearms to left and right, drawing attention, perhaps, to his own claim. A sash and a pair of sandals hang in the field. The youths wear himatia, the woman chiton as well. Her hair is done in the same manner as on A.</p>

<p>There is no relief-contour in either half, nor any for the floral design at each handle, which is of a pattern found in other cups by the Calliope Painter. Brown lines for the metal corners of the writing-case. White for the wreaths, the head-fillet of the left-hand youth on B, the fastenings of the bag, the extra cords of the writing-case, the tags of the sash.</p>

<p>This is a slight piece, but not unpleasant. The motive of putting on the himation or drawing it over or hitching it up is a favourite, in many varieties, about this period. Good examples in other works of the Calliope Painter, for instance a cup-fragment in Athens, his cup in Erlangen, his pelikai in the Noble collection and in the Cabinet des <pb xml:id="iii.68" n="68"/> Médailles; specially like our figure, on his cup in Aleria.<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.1"><p><rs key="Athens, Acr. 395" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 395</rs> (Langlotz pl. 30); <rs key="Erlangen 290" type="Vase">Erlangen 290</rs>; <rs key="Paris, Cab.

<p>The Calliope Painter was a lesser contemporary of the Eretria Painter: contemporary, colleague, and at times collaborator. In a cup in Freiburg, the inside picture is by the Calliope Painter, the outside pictures by the Eretria.<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.3"><p><title>ARV.1</title> p. 729 no. 66 and p. 734 no. 7; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1254 no. 86 and p. 1261 no. 39.</p></note> Further, in the matter of handle-palmettes, the cups of the two painters agree. Two types are used: in the finer cups a very handsome and elaborate design based on the 'lyre-palmette' and carried out in relief-lines; in the slight cups a simpler design based on the 'double palmette', without relief-lines; the lower of the two palmettes is usually shorter than the upper, and the tips of its petals 'submerged'. Given handle-palmettes only, I doubt if one could distinguish a cup in which the figure-work is by the one painter from a cup in which the figure-work is by the other. The same may be said of the maeander borders.</p>

<p>Height 0.191, diameter 0.087. <title>VA</title>. p. 179 fig. 111; the shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 82. A, woman; B, Eros. About 425 B.C., by the Eretria Painter. I have always connected it with that exquisite miniaturist (<title>VA</title>. p. 180; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 731, foot; <title>BSA</title>. 41 p. 13), and especially with his vase of the same shape in Oxford (<rs key="Oxford 537" type="Vase">Oxford 537</rs>: <title>VA</title>. p. 179 fig. 110 bis; <title>CV</title>. pl. 40, 3-5: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 725 no. 8; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1248 no. 10); but hesitated to ascribe it to him: I now feel that I can do so, as a later work than the Oxford vase (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 1248 no. 11).</p>

<p>On the shape see <title>CV</title>. Oxford i, pp. 30-31, <title>BSA</title>. 41 pp. 12-14, and <title>EVP</title>. pp. 102-3. There are eight examples in Attic red-figure, running from about 430 to about 380. Ours goes closely with two others, <rs key="Oxford 537" type="Vase">Oxford 537</rs>, already mentioned, and <rs key="Berlin inv. 30036" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 30036</rs>, by the Heimarmene Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.4"><p>FR. pl. 170, 2 and iii p. 313; Neugebauer pl. 64, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 738, foot, no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1173 no. 1. The eighth red-figure vase of this type was recently in the London market (<title>Cat. Sotheby 23 Oct. 1961</title> no. 161): I have not seen it: on one side, an Oriental youth (?) and a woman; on the other, two women, ill preserved. Elongated. The latest of the eight.</p></note></p>

<p>The two figures are connected. On one side of the vase, a woman, dressed in chiton and himation, sits on a chair, with her feet on a stool, binding her head, drawing the cord or ribbon tight with both hands. A small head-band hangs above. On the other side of the vase, Eros, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*O*S</foreign>, stands on a rock, with one foot set higher, and waits, his right arm akimbo, his left hand holding a box. Relief-contours. Brown for the minor details of Eros' body, for the arcs on the coverts of his wings, for the crosses on the head-band and for its fringe. The box and the rock are scumbled with brown. White for the wreath of Eros, for the inscription, and for four round objects on the lid of the box. Such objects on boxes have always puzzled me:<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.5"><p><title>CV</title>. Oxford i p. 28 on pl. 37, 3-4, and p. 38, left, top.</p></note> there should be some simple explanation of them, but I do not know what it is. As for the head-band, it reappears on the Oxford amphoriskos and on the pyxis by the Eretria Painter in Worcester, Massachusetts.<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.6"><p><title>Worc. Ann.</title> 2 pp. 28-31: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 726 no. 26; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1250 no. 33.</p></note> The Worcester pyxis has an Eros quite like ours, but on a smaller scale.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Under each handle, there is an elegant floral design, carried out almost wholly in relief-lines. It is in three stories: a palmette rises from a pair of 'internal helices'<note anchored="true" n="iii.68.7"><p>The term is Jacobsthal's: see his <title>O</title>. pp. 130-2.</p></note> and supports a taller palmette on its shoulders; a third palmette, shorter, sits in the usual way on the volutes at the top of the second. Tendrils, forming volutes, start from the tops of both the lower palmettes and end in flowers. There are long leaves in most of the axils; and a few <pb xml:id="iii.69" n="69"/> floating circles. The design is not rigidly symmetrical. 'Internal helices' first appear in the Eretria Painter: on his squat lekythoi in Boston and in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.69.1"><p><rs key="Boston 95.48" type="Vase">Boston 95.48</rs>: above, <ref target="no.65" n="U">i, no. 65, with suppl. plate 4, 43 and ii p. 102</ref>: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 724 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1248 no. 11. <rs key="New York 31.11.13" type="Vase">New York 31.11.13</rs>: Richter and Hall pl. 176, 139: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 725 no. 7; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1248 no. 9.

<p>The vase is said to have been found together with a stemless cup of another shape — a sort of cup-skyphos which is now in Berlin.<note anchored="true" n="iii.69.2"><p><rs key="Berlin inv. 3244" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 3244</rs>: <title>A.D.</title> 1 pl. 59, below=Fröhner <title>Brant</title>. pl. 30; <title>CV</title>. pl. 116, 3-5 and pl. 120, 4: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 753 top; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1142. See below, <ref target="iii.74" n="U">iii p. 74</ref> (<rs key="Boston 13.100" type="Vase">Boston 13.100</rs>).</p></note> The provenience was at first given as Capua, but later as Sorrento.</p>

<p>Ours is a shallow, thin-walled, stemless cup. The handles are cup-handles, and the inside of them is reserved. There is no rim-reserve. The lower part of the bowl is turned, tooled off from the rest of the bowl with a jog, so as to form a kind of base. The side of the broad foot is triple — a torus lipped both above and below. The underside of the foot is modelled, and black except for the small central disk, which is reserved and decorated with a dot within two circles; even the resting-surface is black. The shape, all but small details, is the same as in earlier vases, from the neighbourhood of the Sotades Painter, such as the stemless cup by the Hippacontist Painter in Boston.<note anchored="true" n="iii.69.3"><p><rs key="Boston 13.203" type="Vase">Boston 13.203</rs>: I, <title>JHS</title>. 56 p. 209 fig. 8; the shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 208: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 455 no. 4; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 770 no. 4.</p></note> It is in Sotadean surroundings that two favourite features of stemless cups are first found: the jog-base, and the modelled underfoot. Cups of this shape often have a lip inside the bowl, but ours has not.</p>

<p>Our stemless bears the signature of the potter, on the right of B, in white, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*C*E*N*O*T*I*M*O*S</foreign> and below it <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>. It is the only signature of Xenotimos. At one time there were thought to be traces of the name on the Berlin stemless found with ours, but this proved to be an illusion.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Inside, within a circle, Perithoos sits on a chair, dressed in chlamys, petasos, sandals and stockings, holding a pair of spears in his left hand, his right hand resting on his left knee. He has a full beard, and longish hair covering the nape. The petasos is secured by a band, the back part of which shows below it. Relief-lines for most of the contour, also for the ground-line; brown for the minor markings of the body. White for the inscription, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*E*R*I*Q*O*S</foreign>. This, the usual writing of the name on Attic vases, may be either for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Peri/qous</foreign> or for <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Peiriqous</foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Peri/qous</foreign> is the more probable, as the proper Attic form, used by Sophocles (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1594">Soph. OC 1594</bibl>) and also known from the name of the Attic deme <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Periqoi=dai</foreign> (in <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Peiri/qoos</foreign> the impure diphthong is of course epic lengthening).</p>

<p>Without the inscription, no one would have taken this for Perithoos. It is a very slight representation of the stark hero, doomed for a fearful transgression to sit in Hades for ever. In the late fifth century these neat little figures are common everywhere, in relief sculpture as well as on vases: looking like children, or children dressed up. In our vase nearly all the figures are very short, with big heads: a special reason for this is the shallowness of the space to be decorated, as earlier in the black-figure, cups of the Little Masters: 'with normal proportions the figures would look too tenuous'.<note anchored="true" n="iii.69.4"><p><title>Dev</title>. p. 54.</p></note></p>

<p>There are only two other Attic pictures of Perithoos in Hades, both earlier than ours. On the New York calyx-krater from which the Nekyia Painter has received his name, Herakles, guided by Hermes, approaches Theseus and Perithoos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.69.5"><p><rs key="New York 08.258.21" type="Vase">New York 08.258.21</rs>: <title>Metr.

Jacobsthal called him Perithoos (<title>Metr. St.</title> 5 p. 124), and is followed by Brommer and Kunze: I wonder if it is certainly Perithoos?

<p>Theseus and Perithoos usually sit on rocks, but in the bronze relief on a proper throne. In the Nekyia of Polygnotos they sat on thrones (<bibl n="Paus. 10.29.9">Paus. 10.29.9</bibl>), and in the epitome of Apollodoros (<bibl n="Apollod. Epit. E.1.24">Apollod. E.1.24</bibl>) they sit on 'the throne of Lethe'. Panyassis, quoted by Pausanias, might appear to identify 'thrones' and 'rock': he may have thought of rock-carved thrones. The magic seat, from which one cannot rise again, recurs in the story of the Return of Hephaistos; and I am moved to transcribe a passage from John Evelyn's Diary (1644: i p. 123) where he tells what he saw in the Villa Borghese at Rome:</p>

<p>'They showed us also a chair that catches fast any who sits down in it, so as not to be able to stir out, by certain springs concealed in the arms and back thereof, which at sitting down surprises a man on the sudden, locking him in by the arms and thighs, after a true treacherous Italian guise.'</p>

<p>The painter of the Boston vase has substituted what looks like an ordinary chair, of klismos kind, for the magic throne.</p>

<p>It was suggested earlier in these pages, (<ref target="iii.57" n="U">iii p. 57</ref>; <rs key="Boston 98.931" type="Vase">Boston 98.931</rs>) that there may possibly be another Attic picture of Perithoos in Hades, inside the Telephos cup (Plate LXXXVIII). The moment would be the same as in the late-fifth century three-figure relief and on the Apulian volute-krater, fourth century, in Munich (<rs key="Munich 3297" type="Vase">Munich 3297</rs>): Theseus' farewell to his friend.<note anchored="true" n="iii.70.4"><p>Götze in <title>RM</title>. 53 pll. 34-35 with pp. 207-20.

<p>Outside our vase, the subject occupies both halves, although interrupted by the palmettes at the handles. On A, the altar — of Zeus as we know from Polion's picture in Bonn<note anchored="true" n="iii.70.5"><p><ref target="iii.71" n="U">iii p. 71</ref> note 7 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 99.539" type="Vase">Boston 99.539</rs>).</p></note> — , and on it the egg, and an eagle. Tyndareos, white-haired and white-bearded, stands near the altar, wearing a long sleeveless chiton, a himation, a wreath of long leaves, and holding a sceptre in his left hand. The right leg is bent and frontal. The collar-bones show above the chiton. The hair covers the nape. The name is misspelt <foreign xml:lang="greek">*T*E*U*D*A*R*E*W*S</foreign>. Perhaps the writer had Teukros in his mind.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>On the other side of the altar Leda, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*L*E*D*A</foreign>, starts away with arms extended, looking back, as if surprised and alarmed. She wears a peplos, with overfall and short kolpos, below which the ends of the girdle are seen. The peplos has a pair of stripes down the right side, and is <foreign xml:lang="greek">a)ktinwto/s</foreign>, has a ray-border below. The hair is gathered up at the back, in simple fashion. The altar is in the foreground: Tyndareos and Leda are shown as behind it.</p>

<p>Another woman stands behind Tyndareos, with her right hand raised, taking more quiet note of the occurrence. It is Klytaimestra, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*L*U*T*A*I*M*E*S*T*R*A</foreign>, daughter of Tyndareos and Leda. She wears chiton and himation. A fillet passes thrice round her head, and the hair is done up into a ball.</p>

<p>The three female figures on the other half are a pair and a singleton. From position and attitude the right-hand one plainly belongs to the scene on A, looking at the egg and the eagle, her left arm showing awareness, her right arm akimbo. The hair is bobbed, clearing the shoulders. The peplos, with apoptygma and kolpos, is the same as Leda's, except that it has no ray-border. The name is not given, the artist having chosen to put the signature, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*C*E*N*O*T*I*M*O*S *E*P*O*I*E*S*E*N</foreign>, in the space to right of the head. The other two <pb xml:id="iii.71" n="71"/> women converse with each other, their backs turned to the scene. They form one of those 'side-groups' that are common on vases: like the Tyche and Heimarmene on a contemporary vase, the pointed amphoriskos in Berlin;<note anchored="true" n="iii.71.1"><p><rs key="Berlin inv. 30036" type="Vase">Berlin inv. 30036</rs>: FR. pl. 170, 2: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 738, foot, no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1173 no. 1.</p></note> or much earlier, the side-group in black-figure Judgements of Paris.<note anchored="true" n="iii.71.2"><p>e.g. <title>Dev</title>. pl. 15, 1.</p></note> Kleopatra (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*L*E*O*T*R*A</foreign> with two letters omitted, perhaps by a sort of haplography with <foreign xml:lang="greek">*T</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P</foreign>), stands in almost the same attitude as Tyndareos on A. She wears chiton and himation, and her hair is done up into a ball behind. Phylonoe, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*F*U*L*O*N*O*E</foreign>, faces her, bending forward, with her right foot set on a rock and her chin resting on her left hand. A broad band or sling, decorated with a row of lotus-buds, passes round her head. She wears a chiton, with a long kolpos, overgirt. Kleopatra's chiton has the same kolpos, overgirt, but the lower part of it is concealed by the himation. Phylonoe is mentioned by Apollodorus (<bibl n="Apollod. 3.10.6">Apollod. 3.10.6</bibl>) as a daughter of Leda; and the name was already restored by Newton on the black-figured amphora by the Edinburgh Painter in the British Museum, where Polydeukes and Castor are seen in company with Tyndareos and a woman whose name ends in <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*O*E</foreign>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.71.3"><p><rs key="London B 170" type="Vase">London B 170</rs>: <title>CV</title>. e pl. 34, 2: <title>ABV</title>. p. 671, foot.</p></note> Several Kleopatras are known in Greek legend, the most famous being the wife of Meleager: but none of them were related to Tyndareos or Leda.<note anchored="true" n="iii.71.4"><p>A Kleopatra and a Phylonoe are both among the companions of Nausicaa on a pyxis by Aison in Boston (<rs key="Boston 04.18" type="Vase">Boston 04.18</rs>: <title>Jh</title>. 8 pl. 1, whence FR. iii p. 99: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 800 no. 17; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1177 no. 48), and a Phylonoe is present at the departure of Polites on Aison's neck-amphora in Chantilly (Panofka <title>Pourt</title>. pll. 35-36: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 798 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1176 no. 25).

<p>In the figures, most of the contours are relief-lines, but there is not much relief-contour in the floral designs.</p>

<p>A list of vases having the same theme, Leda and the Egg, is given in <title>EVP</title>. pp. 39-42, with references to previous studies, the most important of which are by Kekule and Chapouthier.<note anchored="true" n="iii.71.10"><p>Kekule <title>Ueber ein griechisches Vasengemälde im Akademischen Kunstmuseum zu Bonn</title> (abbreviated <title>U</title>.) and <title>Die Geburt der Helena aus dem Ei</title> (abbreviated <title>G</title>.); Chapouthier in <title>BCH</title>. 1942-3 pp. 1-21.

<p>No. 13 in my list is in the collection of Prof. Domenico Mustilli at S. Agata de' Goti; it has now been republished by him in <title>Annuario</title> 24-26 pp. 125-7 and the obverse by Moreau <title>Das Trierer Kornmartktmosaik</title> pl. 19, 1. It goes with a bell-krater fragment in the Agora Museum, <rs key="Athens, Agora P 12640" type="Vase">Athens, Agora P 12640</rs>, and another in the Ceramicus Museum (<title>Anz</title>. 1937 p. 194 fig. 13.3). All these are connected with the Semele Painter and, less closely, with the Suessula Painter. It is possible (naturally no more) that the small Ceramicus fragment is from a picture of Leda and the egg, and since it comes from the grave of the Spartans who fell in 403 B.C. a Spartan object would be appropriate.
</p>
<p>No. 11 in my list, the Oxford fragment, <rs key="Oxford G 138.31" type="Vase">Oxford G 138.31</rs> (<title>CV</title>. pl. 50, 31), represents a sacrifice, I now see, and not Tyndareos at the altar. A bell-krater fragment with an eagle, Athens, Agora, (<rs key="Athens, Agora P 8891" type="Vase">Athens, Agora P 8891</rs>), is doubtless from a picture of Leda and the egg. A fragment of an Attic calyx-krater in Aegina has the altar, the egg, and to left of the altar the legs of Leda standing at it. The date is about 430-420. Fragments of a big red-figured vase from Analipsis near Vourvoura in Kynouria, at present in Athens (Orlandos <title>To ergon</title> 1955 p. 85), show the egg on the altar and Helen coming out of it; the eagle flying overhead; Leda starting away in alarm, in the same attitude as on the Xenotimos vase, and the Dioskouroi, each leading his horse, one on each side of the central group. The date is near the end of the fifth century, and the vase, as Mrs. Karouzou has seen, is non-Attic.

This vase, by the way, is what is called the 'Casuccini lekane' by Miss Elia (<title>NSc</title>. 1937 p. 108) and Picard (<title>RA</title>. 1938, ii, p. 105).

<p>My no. 15, the pleasant bell-krater, from Frignano, in Naples, rightly assigned by Miss Elia to the Caivano Painter, deserves a word or two (<title>NSc</title>. 1937 p. 105, xv, and p. 108, whence <title>RA</title>. 1938, ii, p. 104; <title>BSR</title>, 20 pl. 16, b): (1) Helen bursts from the egg 'and already extends her arm to the world', as Picard well says (<title>RA</title>. 1938, ii p. 103); but he proceeds to align her with Mycenaean goddesses who raise their arms, which seems excessive; (2) Miss Elia finds fault with the attitude of Leda, but I have answered that in <title>EVP</title>. p. 41; (3) Miss Elia censures 'the uncouth gesture of Tyndareos, who takes hold of his beard and puts one finger in his mouth': I must defend the artist: the finger is not in the mouth but below it.

<p>The earliest representation of the subject has come to my notice since the list in <title>Etruscan Vase-painting</title> was drawn up. It is on two fragments of an Attic red-figured pyxis (type A), from Locri, in Reggio. (Pyxides usually have feminine subjects as one might expect).<note anchored="true" n="iii.72.2"><p>See <ref target="i.35" n="U">i p. 35</ref>.</p></note> On one fragment, an altar, and on it the child Helen creeping out of a half egg-shell; then, on the right, the legs of a woman in chiton and himation — Leda — standing to left. On the other fragment, an open hand extended to right, then the head, to right, and shoulders, of a woman; between, <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*K]*A*L*O*N</foreign>. These may be parts of fleeing figures moving to left and looking round: if so, they would come from the left-hand part of the picture if it were unrolled. The date is little later, if at all, than 450, and this is the only <title>Attic</title> picture in which Helen is seen issuing from the egg.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>According to the version of the legend given in the <title>Cypria</title>, and current in Attica, Leda was not the mother of Helen, but her foster-mother, the mother being Nemesis. It is not known that in the <title>Cypria</title> the egg was laid at Rhamnus: this may have been an Attic addition. As to how the egg came into Leda's care, our authorities differ, and the story may have been told in different ways. According to Sappho, Leda 'found' the egg; Hyginus preserves a tradition that Hermes took it from Rhamnus to Sparta and threw it into Leda's lap as she sat; and Hermes appears in two of the Attic pictures and in an Etruscan which is probably copied from an Attic (nos. 10, 13, and 16). In other Etruscan drawings, on vases or mirrors, it is sometimes Hermes, sometimes Castor, who gives the egg to Leda or Tyndareos. In Apollodorus a shepherd finds it and brings it to Leda. We conjecture that in the Attic version it was Hermes who brought the egg from Rhamnus to Sparta. There he may have handed it to Leda, or planted it where Leda, or Castor, or another would find it.</p>
<pb xml:id="iii.73" n="73"/>
<p>None of our authors mention the altar of Zeus, which is the centre of the scene in the Attic pictures, in the Italiote, and in one of the Etruscan, and we have to reconstruct the story as best we may from the pictures themselves. It has usually been supposed that the moment represented is when Leda sees the egg for the first time; but Chapouthier has recently argued that it is a later moment: Leda has already received the egg, and now brings it to the altar of Zeus to hatch out. I do not find it easy to choose between these two theories, and possibly the moment is not the same in all the pictures: but I am inclined to agree with Chapouthier's main contention. A reasonable course for the story to follow would be that Hermes brought the egg to Leda, with instructions to keep it safe, and after a certain interval to place it on the altar of Zeus and see what would happen. It would of course be more satisfactory if we could be positive that on the Etruscan stamnos in Palermo<note anchored="true" n="iii.73.1"><p><title>AZ</title>. 1871 pl. 47 and pl. 46, 1: see <title>EVP</title>. pp. 39-40.</p></note> Leda was putting the egg down and not picking it up. Again, on the Boston stemless the alarm of Leda might suggest that she was seeing the egg for the first time. One might answer that what alarms her is not the egg but the eagle. This answer would not apply, however, to another vase on which Leda is in the same attitude, the Vienna bell-krater by the Nikias Painter, no. 9 in my list,<note anchored="true" n="iii.73.2"><p><rs key="Vienna 2000" type="Vase">Vienna 2000</rs>: Kekule <title>G</title>. pl. 7, 1; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 848 no. 4, as in the manner of the Nikias Painter; it is by the Nikias Painter himself (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 1334 no. 17).</p></note> for there is no eagle. Thirdly, the gesture of Leda in most of the Attic pictures is really rather like that of one who sees a strange object for the first time.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Ours is the only picture in which the eagle is seen standing on the altar: in the others where it appears it is flying down towards the altar. Kekule suggested that the eagle was about to pick the egg open and so assist the child to come forth, and the thought has been ingeniously developed by Chapouthier.<note anchored="true" n="iii.73.3"><p>Kekule <title>G</title>. p. 702; Chapouthier, see <ref target="iii.71" n="U">iii p. 71</ref> note 10 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 99.539" type="Vase">Boston 99.539</rs>).</p></note> I do not feel sure about this; on the other hand I find it hard to agree with Picard that the only reason for the presence of the eagle is to show us that the altar is the altar of Zeus.<note anchored="true" n="iii.73.4"><p><title>Rev. arch.</title> 24 (1945) p. 133.</p></note> Is it not a sign sent by Zeus to prove to Leda and the family that he is the father of Helen: like the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sh/mata</foreign> spoken of in the <title>Choephoroi</title> of Aeschylus (<bibl n="Aesch. Lib. 259">Aesch. Lib. 259</bibl>), like the <foreign xml:lang="greek">sa=ma</foreign> given by Zeus to Minos in Bacchylides (<bibl n="Bacchyl. 17.52-71">Bacchyl. 17.52-71</bibl>), like the <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ssi/ moi ui(o/s</foreign> of Zeus to Kastor in Pindar (<bibl n="Pind. N. 10">Pind. N. 10.80</bibl>), or the <foreign xml:lang="greek">ou(=tos e)stin o( ui(o/s mou</foreign> elsewhere?</p>

<p>Chapouthier takes the eagle for Zeus himself: surely it is Zeus' messenger only? Yet a curious monument, discovered since Chapouthier wrote, shows that in late antiquity the eagle was regarded, by one artist at least, as Zeus himself. A mosaic at Treves, some six centuries later than the last of our pictures, has the egg, the altar, Leda, and Tyndareos.<note anchored="true" n="iii.73.5"><p><title>ILN</title>. 14 April 1951 pp. 562-3; <title>Aus der Schatzkammer des antiken Trier</title> Beil. 7, whence Rumpf <title>MZ</title>. pl. 71, 1; Moreau <title>Die Trierer Kornmarktmosaik</title>.</p></note> The artist has adopted the later version of the story, in which the egg contained not <title>Aelena</title> only but <title>Castor</title> and <title>Polus</title> as well, and the three embryos are seen neatly packed inside it. He has made <title>Lyda</title> naked; he has forgotten the name of Tyndareos and substituted <title>Agamemnon</title>; and he names the eagle <title>Iobis</title>, which must be nominative and not genitive.</p>

<p>One respect has been noticed in which the Boston vase is unique, and there is another. In many of the pictures the Dioscuri are present: our painter shows the daughters instead of the sons. He has feminized the subject: it is not 'A sister for Polydeukes and Castor', but 'A sister for Klytaimestra'. The new Reggio vase may have agreed in this particular; but not enough remains for one to be sure.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>With the exception of the Reggio fragments, which, as we said above, cannot be much later, if at all, than 450, the representations of the Egg begin about 430, and none of the Attic pictures are much later than 400. It is thought that the sudden popularity of the subject may be connected with the extension of the cult of Nemesis at Rhamnus, where the goddess was now provided with a new temple and a magnificent image. The relief on the base of the statue represented not the beginning of Leda's guardianship, but the very end of it, Leda presenting her fosterling, full-grown and radiant, to the mother. No folklore there, but simultaneously the picturesque fairy-tale took a new lease of life, to remain a favourite throughout antiquity.</p>

<p>This is the only vase with the signature of the potter Xenotimos. We said at the begin- <pb xml:id="iii.74" n="74"/>ning that another stemless cup, of different type, now in Berlin, was stated to have been found together with ours. It has been thought to be by the same hand: I have never felt certain of this, but the style is indeed very similar. The proportions of the figures are different and more normal, but that is because the picture-space is not so low. The floral decoration is very like. The subject is again a feminine one: Nereus, with a selection of his many daughters. On one half, he sits on a rock, Hilithya shows her father a dolphin, Eulimene draws her himation about her; on the other, Psamathe is seated, Ploto brings her a hare, and Thetis a wreath. The style of the two vases is not very far remote from the Washing Painter, but not so near that one can speak of anything like his manner or his school.</p>

<p>Height 0.17, diameter 0.13. From the Spinelli collection. A, a man setting up a herm; B, a boy. About 440-430 B.C.</p>

<p>One handle and part of the mouth are lost. The surface is badly damaged, and a good deal of the black glaze has flaked off: our photographs were taken before the recent restoration. There is no base-fillet. The foot, which projects but little, is torus-like, narrows somewhat downwards.</p>

<p>On the front, an old man, his garment let down and tied round his waist, is setting up a herm in a sanctuary of Hermes, near the altar. A votive plaque is seen hanging, perhaps from the pair of bull's horns above it. The man places the herm carefully, with his left arm round it and his right hand holding it behind. He has a worn old face with bony forehead, long thin nose, puffy lips, sunken jaws, thin neck, weak, scanty brown hair and beard. This is surely not a nondescript workman, but the sculptor himself?</p>

<p>The back of the vase is connected with the front: a boy in a himation moves gaily up with one arm stretched out.</p>

<p>Brown for the sculptor's hair and beard, for the line of his cheek where it stands out from the toothless jaw, for the edge of the false ribs, for the binding of the long hair of the herm at shoulder level, for the design on the plaque, and for the tufts of hair below the bull's horns; on B, for the edge of the himation. There is no relief-contour. The shape of the sculptor's nose can be made out, though not in the photograph; the nose of the herm is damaged, and the upper edge of the eye.</p>

<p>The sanctuary is like that depicted on earlier vases, for instance the column-krater, with a sacrificial scene, by the Pan Painter, in Naples:<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.1"><p><title>ML</title>. 22 pl. 80, whence Rumpf <title>Religion der Griechen</title> and <title>Panmaler</title> pl. 30, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 362 no. 14; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 551 no. 15.</p></note>there too we see a marble herm, wearing a bronze chaplet, an altar in front of the herm, and a pair of horns on the wall, this time goat's horns. Again, on a small lekythos, by the Icarus Painter, in Berlin, we have herm, altar, plaques, horns, and a tree as well.<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.2"><p><rs key="Berlin 2013" type="Vase">Berlin 2013</rs>: Gerhard <title>Ak.

<p>The design on our plaque is fretted and hard to make out. One thinks of a herm, clothed and crowned, as, for example, on the bell-krater by the Pantoxena Painter in Syracuse;<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.3"><p><title>ML</title>. 14 pl. 56, whence Rumpf <title>Religion der Griechen</title> fig. 67 and Lullies <title>Die Typen der griechischen Herme</title> pl. 8, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 694 no. 4; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1050 no. 4.</p></note> but the explanation is not quite satisfactory.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>Hair and beard are often left blank in pictures of marble herms, and not filled in with dark colour as might be expected.</p>

<p>There are a few other representations of sculptors on vases. On a cup by Epiktetos in Copenhagen, a sculptor is giving the last touches, with a chisel but without a mallet, to a marble herm.<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.4"><p><title>VA</title>. p. 17; Langlotz <title>G.V.</title> pl. 3, 5; <title>CV</title>. pl. 139, 2; Blümel <title>Bildhauer an der Arbeit</title> p. 5: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 48 no. 52: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 75 no. 59.</p></note> Bronze statuaries, one of them with a realistic Greek face, are represented on the Foundry Painter's name-piece in Berlin;<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.5"><p>See <ref target="iii.65" n="U">iii p. 65</ref> note 2 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 59.178" type="Vase">Boston 59.178</rs>).</p></note> perhaps also on an earlier cup, by the Euergides Painter, in Athens, but this part of the cup is fragmentary and the interpretation uncertain.<note anchored="true" n="iii.74.6"><p><rs key="Athens, Acr. 166" type="Vase">Athens, Acr. 166</rs>: Langlotz pl. 6: <title>ARV</title>. p. 62 no. 60; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 92 no. 64.</p></note> A sculptor in marble is perhaps to be seen at work on the cup by the <pb xml:id="iii.75" n="75"/> Foundry Painter in Munich, giving the last touches, this time with mallet as well as chisel, to the mane of a horse.<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.1"><p><rs key="Munich 2650" type="Vase">Munich 2650</rs>: Gerhard <title>AV</title>. pl. 229-30; <title>Jb</title>. 44 p. 25: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 263 no. 2: <title>ARV.2</title> p. 401 no. 2. The horse has been thought to be a wooden model (for a bronze statue) on the ground that the tools are those of a wood-carver (<title>Jb</title>. 44 p. 20): they are surely those of a sculptor in marble. It must be admitted that the men in long chiton and himation look more like Achaean heroes than contemporary Athenians.</p></note> Lastly, an Italiote sculptor of the fourth century is seen painting a marble statue of Herakles on a column-krater in New York.<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.2"><p>Bothmer in <title>Bull. Metr.</title> Feb. 1951 pp. 156-61.</p></note></p>

<p>Our pelike at once recalls two vases in which, not a sculptor, but a satyr is engaged with a herm. On an oinochoe in Leningrad, of about 450 B.C., a satyr runs with a marble herm held over his shoulder;<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.3"><p><title>Compte Rendu</title> 1874 pl. 2, 1-2, whence <title>Anz</title>. 1943 p. 130 fig. 10.</p></note> and on a jug of about 460, in the manner of the Tarquinia Painter, in Copenhagen, a satyr is placing a marble herm on its base.<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.4"><p><title>CV</title>. pl. 158, 9, whence <title>Anz</title>. 1943 p. 126 fig. 6: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 572 no. 20; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 873 no. 30.</p></note> Or so I have always thought: according to Brommer the satyrs are stealing the herms:<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.5"><p><title>Satyrspiele</title> 1 p. 76 = 2 p. 80.</p></note> one can believe anything of a satyr, but I do not detect any sign of dishonesty either here or indeed in an Athens terracotta;<note anchored="true" n="iii.75.6"><p><title>Anz</title>. 1943 p. 125 fig. 5; Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 62.</p></note> in particular no fear is shown, and fear would have been suggested by making the satyrs look round.</p>

<p>One would like to know the painter of our attractive little vase, but I cannot point to any other that is by the same hand. The shape of the pelike recalls the Hasselmann Painter, and the style of drawing is perhaps not far from him (<title>ARV.2</title> p. 1139, foot, no. 1); but elsewhere he is a conventional artist, and our vase is not conventional.</p>

<p>Height 0.189, diameter 0.194. The shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 125, 78. A, sacrifice to Hermes; B, youth. About 425-420 B.C.</p>

<p>A. A youth catches a goat, taking it by the horns and bestriding it. It bleats. He wears a wrap which falls away from his shoulders. Hermes stands watching, dressed in chlamys, winged cap, sandals and stockings, with a pair of wings attached to each ankle. In his right hand he holds a caduceus; his left raises the chlamys from within. His hair covers his neck; the youth's is shorter. Three small objects hang on the wall. Two are pinakes. One represents a naked male running to left with arms outstretched — or one arm outstretched, and a cloak flying behind — ; the subject of the other is hard to make out. The third object is a small statuette, probably in clay, representing a herm. It is drawn in profile, and so is the shelf on which it stands. The back of the shelf is fastened to the wall by two nails at the upper corners. The scene is laid in a sanctuary of Hermes, to whom the goat will be sacrificed. The statuette shows the god in his primitive form, but the god himself is present.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. Brown lines for the minor markings on the bodies, and for parts of the goat's skin. The black of the background has encroached upon the youth's toes and left heel.</p>

<p>The figure on the back of the vase is connected with those on the front: a youth in a himation hastens towards them; compare no. 164. There is no relief-contour.</p>

<p>The style may somewhat recall the Washing Painter.</p>

<p>The foot is a stout torus, with the profile reserved. There is a base-fillet, concave. The mouth is a torus, rolled above, and rather broad. The handles are convex.</p>
<pb xml:id="iii.76" n="76"/>
<p>On the front, two young warriors are about to leave home. As very often, the lesser, the companion, is light-armed, the other more heavily. Each holds a spear. The youth in the middle has his shield at his side, resting on the ground, and held by the rim. The body of the shield is black; the rim is reserved, and so is the device, a lion of the puppy build that prevails in the second half of the fifth century. He wears a belted chitoniskos of thick material, with 'blanket' patterns<note anchored="true" n="iii.76.1"><p>On such patterns see <title>AJA</title>. 1939 p. 622.</p></note> — embattled lines, net-bands, rows of vees, of circles, of dots; at the top, a dot-border, and below it a band of 'double vees' with a loop at the apex; at the lower edge of the garment, a similar band. Round the head, a bandeau, <foreign xml:lang="greek">stro/fion</foreign>. A sword hangs from a bandolier at the flank. A woman stands facing him, carefully, almost reverently, holding his Corinthian helmet with both hands. She wears a chiton only, with kolpos. Behind the youth, his companion stands, with the left leg frontal and slightly bent at the knee. He wears a chlamys and a petasos. The band securing the petasos is seen above the ear. Relief-contour for the faces but for little else. There is some shading in brown on the edges of the helmet-skull, and some brown inner marking on the arms of the youth in the middle. The sternomastoid line on the neck is in relief. For the three dots (bosses) on the sword-hilt compare the Kleophon Painter's stamnos in Munich and his Munich bell-krater.<note anchored="true" n="iii.76.2"><p><rs key="Munich 2415" type="Vase">Munich 2415</rs>: FR. pl. 35, whence Pfuhl fig. 774: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 784 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1143 no. 2. <rs key="Munich 2394" type="Vase">Munich 2394</rs>: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 785 no. 21; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1145 no. 28.</p></note></p>

<p>On the reverse of the vase, three youths in himatia, the left-hand one standing frontal. No relief-contour. The edges of the himatia are brown. White for the head-fillets.</p>

<p>Below each handle, a conventional design of palmettes, without relief-lines. In the slanting palmettes above the pictures, the tendrils alone have relief. The 'odd man' of the lower border is on the reverse, below the left foot of the youth in the middle.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The Kleophon Painter has a good many pictures of warriors about to leave home, and none of them is without a certain nobility. The precise subject is usually the libation just before departure: here the moment is earlier, and the subject might have been entitled 'arming' except that the word is best kept for scenes in which the warrior is actually putting his armour on. In the Munich bell-krater mentioned above, the young warrior holds his helmet in his hand, his father says a word to him, and a woman holds the shield by the rim in the same way as it is held on the Boston vase. The reverse of the Munich krater is very like our reverse. The middle figure there, as often, is seen to be younger than the other two. This is probably so in our vase as well, and if we did not describe the subject as 'youths and boy' rather than 'three youths' it was because the painter has inadvertently made the right-hand youth shorter than the others.<note anchored="true"><p>(From Addenda to Part III) P. 76: on the Kleophon Painter see also Gualandi in <title>Arte Antica e Moderna</title> 19.

At first I attributed the vase to the Kleophon Painter, adding that it was 'not on the level of his highest achievement'; later, I ranged it under his 'manner', adding that it 'might well be a late work of the painter himself'. A shadow of doubt remains: but I am almost sure that it is by the painter; see also Friis Johansen <title>Eine Dithyrambos-Aufführung</title> pp. 4-6.</p>

<p>The foot of the vase is alien. Part of B is missing, and a few fragments on A. There is a ledge, as often, between mouth and body. The 'odd man' of the lower border is under the left foot of the right-hand figure on B.</p>

<p>A. The altar is a plain block, the side of which is streaked, as usual, with dried blood. There is something on the altar, a small heap or mound (omitted in the older reproduction): part of it is lost in the fracture and I am not sure what it is. A man whose name <pb xml:id="iii.77" n="77"/> ends in <foreign xml:lang="greek">...*S</foreign> stands at the altar and dips the fingers of both hands in a small vessel held for him by the youth Hippokles (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*P*P[*O]*K*L[*H*S]</foreign>) who stands facing him. On his other hand Hippokles holds a platter, the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign>. On the left another youth, Mantitheos (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*M*A*N*T*I*Q*E*O*S</foreign>), bending, holds a young ram at his side. Behind him, the youth Kallias (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*A*L*L*I*A*S</foreign>) plays the flute. On the right of the picture a man named Aresias (<foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*R*E*S*I*A*S</foreign>)<note anchored="true" n="iii.77.1"><p>From de Waele <title>Magic Staff</title> p. 148 it might seem that I had read <foreign xml:lang="greek">[*X]*A*R*E*S*I*A*S</foreign>, but this must be his reading, it was not mine.</p></note> stands watching, his right hand on his staff. All wear himatia and wreaths. Mantitheos has tied his himation round his waist, to leave his arms free. In Aresias and Hippokles it falls in good order over the left shoulder; Aresias raises the end of his with his concealed left hand. In the chief man, and in Kallias, it leaves the left shoulder bare as well as the right. Aresias has rather long hair, covering the neck; the chief man's is nearly as long; the youths have short hair. The skull of an ox is seen above the altar, hanging on the wall; it is bound with a knotted fillet which has tags at the rounded ends. A large wreath is also seen hanging. Three of the figures stand with one leg frontal and bent at the knee, and the head turned in the direction of the supporting leg. In the chief man and in Kallias the hip of the supporting leg is thrown well out and the free leg swings well back.</p>

These upright sprigs are a feature of the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign>, and small clay models of <foreign xml:lang="greek">kana=</foreign> have holes in the appropriate places. A <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign> very like ours appears on the volute-krater fragment, by the Painter of the New York Centauromachy, in Leningrad.<note anchored="true" n="iii.77.3"><p>See <ref target="iii.79" n="U">iii p. 79</ref> no. 5 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 95.24" type="Vase">Boston 95.24</rs>).</p></note></p>

<p>The vessel in the other hand of Hippokles, evidently of metal, has a concave, flaring body like that of a kantharos; two handles like those of metal kylikes; and three small round caster-like feet. More will be said about it, and about the scene in general, when we come to speak of no. 168.<note anchored="true" n="iii.77.4"><p>See <ref target="iii.79" n="U">iii p. 79</ref> (<rs key="Boston 95.24" type="Vase">Boston 95.24</rs>).</p></note> The artist shows part of the inside, although the upper and lower lines of the outside remain straight.</p>

<p>The faces and other bare parts have relief-contour (except most of the feet); but not the himatia. The minor details of the bodies, and the streaks on the altar, are in brown lines. White for the sprigs, the fillet of the bucrane, the wreaths (except the leaves), and the inscriptions.</p>

<p>B. On the back of the vase, a satyr with a drinking-horn stands between two maenads with thyrsoi, one of whom has the body frontal, with the left leg bent at the knee. Both wear chiton, himation, and saccos. One of them draws her himation tight at the left hip. There is no relief-contour. There are some brown details on the satyr's trunk, and the edges of the himatia are brown. White for the satyr's head-fillet and the leaves in the women's hair.</p>

<p>The style is close to the Kleophon Painter, but late and mannered.

<p>The inscriptions were considered in <title>AJA</title>. 1929 pp. 366-7. Aresias is not a common name: one of the Thirty was called Aresias. A Mantitheos was banished in 415 B.C. for participating in the mutilation of the herms. A Kallias, son of Telokles, was prosecuted on the same count: but of course Kallias is a very common name. A Hippokles was one of the Ten.<note anchored="true" n="iii.77.6"><p>In <title>AJA</title>. I read <foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*P*P*O*K*A[*H*S]</foreign> and supposed that the alpha was for a lambda by mistake: but the letter on the vase is in fact lambda.</p></note> The date of the vase is about 425. Is it not possible that the Aresias, the Mantitheos, the Kallias, and the Hippokles are those who played a part in the politics of Athens during the last two decades of the fifth century?</p>

<p>Height 0.4136 ; diameter 0.411 (with the handles, 0.423). Said to have been found in 1889. The shape, Caskey <title>G</title>. p. 129. A, sacrifice. B, youths and boy. Near the end of the fifth century, manner of the Chrysis Painter (<title>VA</title>. p. 84; <title>ARV.1</title> p. 795 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1159, iii, 2).</p>

<p>The foot is lipped; the side of the foot is black, except for the groove that produces the lip.</p>

<p>On the front of the vase, the figures are set at different levels on rocky ground. The low altar is formed of large unwrought stones, topped by a slab on which the firewood lies. The chief man raises his left hand a little and extends his right towards the small vessel held by a boy. On his other hand the boy holds the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign>. On the left a second boy bends with his arms round the neck of a ram. On the right of the picture a youth sits on a low rock, looking towards the scene. His left arm is hidden in his himation, his right hand is on his knee. Above him, another youth stands frontal, looking round towards the middle of the picture and leaning over in the same direction with his right elbow on a rock, behind which his legs are concealed. His left arm is under his himation, akimbo, drawing it tight. The corresponding figure in the left upper part of the picture is a youth wearing a chlamys, with a petasos slung round his neck, and holding a caduceus: Hermes, or at least a herald. He looks round towards the middle and leans over with his left elbow on a rock, which again conceals the legs. All but the herald wear himatia. In the two youths on the right the himation covers the left shoulder; in the man it has slipped off the shoulder; the two boys have trussed it up round the waist. The man's hair falls thick over his neck. The others wear their hair short; but with ringlets in front of the ear, except the boy who holds the ram. All five are wreathed.</p>

<p>There is a sapling, perhaps a laurel, in the middle of the picture near the altar; farther off, another, and a third, partly hidden by a rock, on the other side.</p>

<p>The greater parts of the figures have relief-contour, but not the feet, nor all the drapery. There are some minor lines in brown on the bodies. Some of the upper eyelids are darkened with brown, and there is brown scumbling on the altar, the vessels, and the ram. Two short relief-lines wrinkle the man's forehead. The head-fillets, the petasos-cord, and the terrain-lines are white, the leaves in the hair reserved.</p>

<p>On B, a boy between two youths, one of whom leans on his stick with arm akimbo. No relief-contour. The edges of the himation are brown. Almost the same reverse as on many vases by the Kleophon Painter, by his follower the Dinos Painter, and by companions of the Dinos Painter, among whom the Chrysis Painter is one.</p>

<p>Under each handle, the usual palmettes, without relief-lines.</p>

<p>In its main lines, the composition of the three chief figures — the man, the boy with the vessels, the boy with the ram — is the same as in no. 167, and a very similar group is in <pb xml:id="iii.79" n="79"/> the sacrifice of a ram on a later vase, the Oinomaos krater in Naples.<note anchored="true" n="iii.79.1"><p><rs key="Naples 2200" type="Vase">Naples 2200</rs>: FR. pl. 146: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 879, Oinomaos Painter no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1440 no. 1.</p></note> In all three the acolyte holds the <foreign xml:lang="greek">kanou=n</foreign> with his left hand and in his right the small vessel referred to above.

Later writers refer to the sprinkling of the altar, of the victim, of the congregation, but there seems to be no unequivocal allusion to the washing of the principal person's hands.

This is the costume worn by the Caryatids of the Erechtheion, by the Eirene, and by many other female figures in the late fifth century and the fourth, for example, the Agaue of the Meidias hydria in the British Museum (<rs key="London E 224" type="Vase">London E 224</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.80.1"><p>FR. pl. 8; <title>CV</title>. pl. 91.</p></note> A net-band traverses the apoptygma horizontally, about half-way, and a stripe runs down the left leg where the garment is sewn up. The cloak is bordered. The whole figure, flesh and clothing, is white, with brown details: except the hair and the band or sling containing it. The leaves in the hair, the ear-ring, necklace, bracelets, girdle-ends are raised and were gilt. A child Eros, white except for hair and wings, kneels at the bride's feet as if tying her sandals. His head-band is gilt. A woman stands facing the bride, or approaches her, with the right leg frontal and bent; she holds out a large crown, radiate and gilt, in her left hand. She is dressed in a sleeveless chiton, girt, and with a cord passing over the shoulders. Behind the bride, a third woman stands, or moves, with the right leg frontal and bent, looking back towards her, face in three-quarter view; she holds a necklace with both hands. The chiton is the same as before, but the cord is so arranged that the shoulder is covered as if with a short sleeve. Both these attendants have gilt head-leaves, ear-rings, <pb xml:id="iii.81" n="81"/> necklaces, bracelets, and girdle-ends. The berries of the leaf-pattern above the picture are also gilt.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>The floral design under the handle is without relief-lines. The lower edge of it is 'submerged', thought of as covered by the strip of egg-pattern below. This obscures the nature of the four helices or spirals at the base of the lower palmette. The arrangement of them in Athens (above, no. 8) is similar, but not quite the same.</p>

<p>The handles are twisted. The shape of the vase is the same as in the large neck-amphora, with twisted handles, which first appears over a hundred years earlier, in works by Euphronios and his closest companions,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.4"><p><rs key="Louvre G 107" type="Vase">Louvre G 107</rs>: <title>CV</title>. pl. 33, 1-4. <rs key="Leningrad 610" type="Vase">Leningrad 610</rs>: Marburger <title>Winckelmannsprogramm</title> 1949 pl. 3.</p></note> and is adopted by the Berlin Painter, then by the Niobid Painter, then by Polygnotos and his group, and so down to our vase. There are of course modifications in detail. In our vase the body is narrower, and fuller towards the base; the foot is narrower and more compressed, with the upper member of it curving gradually into the lower.</p>

<p>There is a strong fillet between neck and shoulder. There is a tooled groove, not only above and below the base-fillet, which is concave, but on the upper side of the upper member of the foot, near the edge; and between the two members. These are to be distinguished from the <emph>reserved</emph> line on the edge of each member.</p>

<p>The egg-pattern on the upper member of the mouth, and round the base of the handles, is traditional. So is a double floral pattern on the neck. Here the neck-floral is particularly handsome, and in the taste of the late fifth century — the last quarter or so — and of the early fourth: ess-tendrils in the middle, slender lily-like flowers. Other neck-amphorae have similar decoration on the neck, of course with minor variations: Aison's vase in Chantilly,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.5"><p>Panofka <title>Pourt.</title> pll. 35-36: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 798, foot, no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1176 no. 25.</p></note> and the small neck-amphorae by the Shuvalov Painter.<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.6"><p><title>ARV.1</title> pp. 754-5 nos. 31-33, 35, 37-38; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1209 nos. 48-50, 52, 54-55.</p></note> Exactly the same floral as ours, but single, recurs on one side of a calyx-krater by the Kadmos Painter in Bologna.<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.7"><p><rs key="Bologna 301" type="Vase">Bologna 301</rs>: Pellegrini <title>VF</title>. p. 145: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 804 no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1184 no. 5.</p></note> All these vases, except Aison's, have 'sepals', if one may so call them, in one form or another, at the base of the flowers; and so have the calyx-krater by the Dinos Painter in Bologna,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.8"><p><rs key="Bologna 300" type="Vase">Bologna 300</rs>: Hahland pl. 8, b: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 790 no. 7; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1152 no. 7.</p></note> the gigantomachy calyx in Naples,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.9"><p><rs key="Naples 2883" type="Vase">Naples 2883</rs>: <title>Mon</title>. 9 pl. 6: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 850 no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1338.</p></note> the Italiote volute-krater, by the Dionysiac Painter, in Naples,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.10"><p><rs key="Naples 2411" type="Vase">Naples 2411</rs>: <title>Jb</title>. 27 p. 274; FR. iii p. 344.</p></note> and, earlier, two vases by the Eretria Painter, the onos in Athens,<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.11"><p>See <ref target="iii.83" n="U">iii p. 83</ref>, footnote 2 (in vase description for <rs key="Boston 03.821" type="Vase">Boston 03.821</rs>).</p></note> and fragments of an oinochoe in Oxford.<note anchored="true" n="iii.81.12"><p><title>CV</title>. pl. 43, 9-12: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 725 no. 15; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1249 no. 18.</p></note></p>

<p>The traditional tongue-pattern on the shoulder has been modified: these are the long, large leaves, carefully rounded at the end, of the later fifth century. In the border below the pictures, one notices the tendency, strong in the fourth century, to make the uppermost horizontal of the maeander coincide with the framing line. The 'odd man', a thin chequer-square, is under the left handle. The top-side of the mouth is black.</p>

<p>On the front of the vase there are three groups or rather pairs, interwoven. The chief person is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*P*P*O*D*A*M*H</foreign>, Hippodame, the woman who sits to right, with her right hand raised and her left on her thigh. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*W*S</foreign>, Eros, stands beside her, frontal, the weight chiefly on the right leg, head to left, a platter on his right hand with a fig and two bunches of grapes on it, and a large bunch of grapes in his left hand. Hippodame wears chiton and himation; her long hair falls loose down her back and is crowned. Eros is wreathed, and has the dank hair, as if oiled, which becomes common in the late fifth century for men as well as youths. The next most important person is <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*S*T*E*R*I*A</foreign>, Asteria, who sits on the right of the picture, facing Hippodame. She too wears chiton and himation, but ear-rings too; her hair is lifted by a sling and has leaves stuck in it, or a wreath, in front. Her girdle is seen, and the cord keeping the right sleeve in place. Her right hand toys with her himation at the right shoulder; her left hand passes under, and grasps, the part of the himation that hangs over the left shoulder. A lyre lies on the ground near her. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*I*A*S*W</foreign>, Iaso, moves towards her, holding up a mirror; her right leg frontal, and bent at the knee. She wears a peplos, with overfall, open down the right side. Her hair is dressed like Asteria's, except that the sling is of a different pattern. In both women a small curl escapes in front of the ear. Behind Hippodame, on the left of the picture, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*U*R*U*N*O*H</foreign>, Eurynoe, stands to right, bending, with the left foot raised and set on a rock or hillock. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*O*Q*O*S</foreign>, Pothos, is busy with her sandal. Eurynoe is dressed like Iaso. Her right arm is akimbo, her left forearm rests on her knee. Pothos has the same hair and wreath as Eros, and both have the new light wings of the late fifth century with the quills well separated and curving up at the ends. The peploi and himatia have thick black borders. Hilly ground is indicated by white lines; the plants are reserved. A small palm-tree is seen behind Hippodame, and a wreath hangs above Asteria. The picture is bounded on the left by a slender column supporting a tripod, and on the right by a sapling, perhaps a young olive. Small tripods like this are frequent in the Kadmos Painter, and often at least they are what they seem to be, a light indication of sacred ground.<note anchored="true" n="iii.82.1"><p>See Buschor in FR. iii pp. 145-6.</p></note></p>

<p>The faces, and good part, I think, of the rest, have relief-contour, but my notes on this point are scanty. The terrain-lines and the inscriptions are white.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>We must still try to interpret the picture, and shall return to it. First we describe the reverse of the vase.</p>

<p>A youth, wearing chlamys and wreath, his petasos slung round his neck, a pair of spears in his left hand, pursues a woman, who flees, looking round, and holding the end of her peplos at the right shoulder. Her hair is in a saccos. On the other side of the youth a woman also dressed in a peplos, but bare-headed, flees, looking round and raising her hand. The hair is lifted from the neck and tied close to the back of the head. A sash is seen hanging, above the youth's right arm. The drawing is slight: there is little relief-contour: for the faces, but not much else. This is a stock pursuit-scene, one of hundreds; and it cannot be said to have any connexion with the picture on the front of the vase. The youth may be Theseus.<note anchored="true" n="iii.82.2"><p>See <ref target="ii.81" n="U">ii p. 81</ref>.</p></note></p>

<p>We return to the chief picture. The women's names are not new to us. Many heroines were called Hippodame or at least Hippodameia: the best known is the bride of Pelops; but there is also the bride of Perithoos — otherwise known as Deidameia. There were several Asteriai, the most venerable the daughter of the Titan Koios and sister of Leto, who was turned into the island first called Asterie and later Delos. Iaso was daughter of Asklepios. The name of Eurynoe is less familiar: but Pape culls from Alexander Polyhistor a Eurynoe who was wife to the king of Chytroi in Cyprus (<title>F.H.G.</title> iii p. 236, 94), date unknown; and another Eurynoe figures on the Adonis hydria by the Meidias Painter <pb xml:id="iii.83" n="83"/> in Florence, where she sits with a pet bird perched on her finger, talking to it.<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.1"><p><rs key="Florence 81948" type="Vase">Florence 81948</rs>: Milani <title>Mon. scelti</title> pl. 4 and pl. 5, 1-3; <title>CV</title>. pl. 60, 1, pl. 61, 1, and pll. 62-63: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 832 no. 3; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1312 no. 1.</p></note> All this is not very helpful, and some may be inclined to say that these are just high-sounding names picked by the artist at random. It may be so: but it should perhaps be remembered that we do not know everything about Greek mythology.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>A suggestion may be worth making: Hippodame is Hippodameia, and the artist represents her, waited on by Eros and surrounded by her friends, because she was one of the famous brides of antiquity: for much the same reason that the Eretria Painter chose to represent Alcestis, and Harmonia, on his name-piece in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.2"><p><title>Eph.</title> 1897 pll. 9-10, whence Pfuhl fig. 561: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 726 no. 27; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1250 no. 34: see also <title>EVP</title>. p. 134, foot.</p></note> Hippodameia was the bride of Pelops, and the Kadmos Painter, for a time at any rate, had certain Peloponnesian sympathies: shown by the Dorian inscriptions on his hydriai in Berlin:  — <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*M*A*S</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*Q*A*N*A</foreign> on <rs key="Berlin 2633" type="Vase">Berlin 2633</rs>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Q*H*B*A</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*A*M*A*T*H*R</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*K*O*R*A</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*O*S*E*I*D*A*N</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*M*A*S</foreign> and above all <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*R*T*A*M*I*S</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*P*E*L*L*W*N</foreign> on <rs key="Berlin 2634" type="Vase">Berlin 2634</rs>.<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.3"><p><title>ARV.1</title> p. 805 nos. 21 and 22; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1187 nos. 32 and 33.</p></note> Pelops and Hippodameia rarely appear on Attic vases, in fact only twice: on the neck-amphora in Arezzo, which is of the same type as ours and not much earlier,<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.4"><p><rs key="Arezzo 1460" type="Vase">Arezzo 1460</rs>; FR. pl. 67, whence Pfuhl fig. 583: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 793; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1157 no. 25.</p></note> and on the fourth-century bell-krater by the Oinomaos Painter in Naples.<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.5"><p><rs key="Naples 2200" type="Vase">Naples 2200</rs>: FR. pl. 146: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 879 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1440 no. 1.</p></note></p>

<p>I do not know how far this goes to explain the choice of the name Hippodame; it does not, of course, explain the choice of names for her companions.</p>

<p>The Boston vase has graffiti in the hollow of the foot: they are discussed in <title>AJA</title>. 1941 p. 598 no. 12. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*Spa/qh</foreign> would seem here, on the analogy of other graffiti, to be the name of a vase-shape; but might also have its usual meaning. Two spathai are priced at two drachmai. The remaining graffito recurs on two bell-kraters, one by the Kadmos Painter, the other by the Pothos Painter his companion.<note anchored="true" n="iii.83.6"><p><rs key="Louvre G 503" type="Vase">Louvre G 503</rs>: <title>CV</title>. e pl. 1, 1-3: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 804 no. 8; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1185 no. 18. <rs key="Madrid 11075" type="Vase">Madrid 11075</rs>: Leroux pl. 33, 1: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 802 no. 8; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1189 no. 10.</p></note></p>

<p>The two cups are said to have been found in the same tomb. The first mention of them is by Gustav Korte in <title>AZ</title>. 1878 p. 114. They are replicas, and will be described together. Cup X, as we shall call 00.344, bears a double signature on the exergue of the tondo, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*R*G*I*N*O*S</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*P*O[*I*E]*S*E*N</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*A*R[*I]*S*T*O*F*A[*N*E]*S</foreign>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">*E*G*R*A*F*E</foreign> complete aft. Cup Y, though rather the better of the two, is unsigned.</p>

<p>The cups are of Type B (our figure gives 00.344). The foot-plate is unusual: the profile of it is lipped below; and the underside of the foot has mouldings (which though common in stemless cups is rare in kylikes), besides a black band and some black lines. The Berlin cup with the same double signature<note anchored="true" n="iii.84.1"><p><rs key="Berlin 2531" type="Vase">Berlin 2531</rs>: FR. pl. 27, whence Hoppin i p. 50, (B) Pfuhl fig. 587, (I) Swindler fig. 346; I, Neugebauer pl. 65, 2; <title>CV</title>. pl. 119, pl. 120, 1-3, pl. 121, 2-4, and pl. 133, 10 (Greifenhagen); the palmettes, Jacobsthal <title>O</title>. pl. 86, d: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 841 no. 1; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1319 no. 1.</p></note> has a similar foot, and is close to the Boston pair in other ways.</p>

<p>Inside, on an exergue, Nessos, with Deianeira in his arms, is overtaken by Herakles, who seizes him by the head and steps back for room to swing the club. The <emph>focus</emph> of the picture is the round head of the centaur, in three-quarter view, ringed by thick hair and beard. All four hooves are off the ground. Deianeira extends an arm towards Herakles. She wears bracelets, ear-rings, and a peplos with a pair of stripes down the right side and a longish apoptygma, overgirt. The wrap of Herakles passes over his left arm and right thigh, on the point of falling off: this is a favourite motive from the early classic period onwards<note anchored="true" n="iii.84.2"><p><title>JHS</title>. 59 p. 20, 53.</p></note> and already occurs in the late archaic, on a cup by the Brygos Painter in the British Museum.<note anchored="true" n="iii.84.3"><p><rs key="London E 69" type="Vase">London E 69</rs>: <title>Archaeologia</title> 32 pll. 8-9 and 11; <title>WV</title>. 6 pl. 2; Hofkes-Brukker pl. 10: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 246 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 369 no. 2.</p></note> Aristophanes has it several times.</p>

<p>Relief-contours. A few minor details of the male bodies are in brown lines. The hair is in dark waves on a lighter background.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In Y, the hollows of the folds are shaded with a brown wash which is not, however, applied very precisely; in X the shading is reduced to a few dabs. In X the hair of Deianeira is bound up with a cord that passes thrice round it; in Y it is in a sling, which is ornamented with a maeander in front and palmettes behind. In Y there are two rows of leaves, mostly washed with brown, near the lower edge of the skirt: this is of course a border, and not eye-folds as Hauser claimed. The same appears on the kolpos of Ge in the Berlin Aristophanes. On Y the lower lip of Deianeira is repainted, on X the ends of her hair near the nape. In both the 'odd man' of the maeander is west, a little north.</p>

<p>All three names are inscribed. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*H*R*A*K*L*E*S</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*D*E*I*A*N*E*I*R*A</foreign> are the same in both cups. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N*E*S*S*O*S</foreign> on X, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*N*E*S*O*S</foreign> on Y.</p>

<p>Hauser<note anchored="true" n="iii.84.4"><p>FR. iii p. 50.</p></note> has pointed out the resemblance between these pictures and the Centaur <pb xml:id="iii.85" n="85"/> attacking a woman on a fragment of a stemless cup in Leningrad. There, however, the style is lighter, purer, and nearer to the Meidias Painter, who may indeed be the artist.<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.1"><p><title>Compte Rendu</title> 1869 pl. 4, 13, whence FR. iii p. 47: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 834 no. 4; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1329 no. 116.</p></note> Even closer to the group on our cups, two figures on a volute-krater in Ferrara where the figures are not Perithoos and Deianeira but form part of a Centauromachy at the wedding-feast of Perithoos and may be Eurytion and Deidameia.<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.2"><p>See <ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 9 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>).</p></note> There, as in our picture and in many others of the free style, the focus, the bull's eye of the design, is a round head in three-quarter view.</p>

<p>Outside. The egg-pattern above the pictures is a not infrequent enrichment on cups from the second quarter of the fifth century onward: it occurs, for example, in several cups by the Euaion Painter. The substitution of a maeander for the line border below the outside pictures is quite common on the more elaborate cups both in the late archaic period and after.</p>

<p>The floral design at each handle is fairly careful although without relief-lines. It includes 'internal helices', and acanthus-leaves at the base.<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.3"><p>For the helices see above, <ref target="iii.68" n="U">iii p. 68</ref> (<rs key="Boston 00.355" type="Vase">Boston 00.355</rs>); for the acanthus-leaves, Jacobsthal <title>O</title>. pp. 192 ff. and <title>Greek Pins</title> pp. 69 and 71.

<p>The subject, which first appears in the early classic period, is the Centauromachy at the wedding-feast of Perithoos. There are three pairs, Lapith and Centaur, in each half. We begin with the half that includes the chief person, Perithoos, although the other half is more successful.</p>

<p>In the middle, the Centaur has turned tail, but Perithoos catches him by the hair and strikes down at him with a spit. On this occasion the fight started unexpectedly, and most of the weapons were improvised. (Spits are often used in this scene — already in the Centauromachy on the early classic volute-krater in New York.)<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.4"><p><rs key="New York 07.286.84" type="Vase">New York 07.286.84</rs>: see <ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 3 (<rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>). On the Ferrara krater (<ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 9 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>): <title>Riv. Ist.</title> N.S. 4 p. 118 fig. 25, p. 119 fig. 26, and p. 121) the weapon is a spit, not, as it has been called, a spear. On the volute-krater in the Louvre (<ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 4; vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>) the Centaur attacks with a spit.</p></note> The Centaur grasps the left arm of Perithoos, struggling to free himself. The attitude of Perithoos is much the same as on the new volute-krater in Ferrara;<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.5"><p><ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 9 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>).</p></note> Hauser has compared the fragment of an Amazonomachy, contemporary with the Aristophanes cups, in Odessa.<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.6"><p>Stern <title>Theodosia</title> pl. 3, 16.</p></note> On Y the hero's face has turned out badly.</p>

<p>On the right, the chief companion of Perithoos — Theseus — has his opponent's head in chancery and throttles him. The motive is traditional, and occurs as early as the column-krater in Florence.<note anchored="true" n="iii.85.7"><p><rs key="Florence 3997" type="Vase">Florence 3997</rs>: see <ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 1 (vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>). On the Barcelona pelike (<ref target="iii.87" n="U">iii p. 87</ref> no. 11; vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.345" type="Vase">Boston 00.345</rs>) the artist has misnamed the wrestler, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*P*E*R*I*Q*O*S</foreign>.</p></note> Theseus was thought of as the inventor of scientific wrestling, and the Greek without a weapon in this scene is usually Theseus. On our cups the Centaur lays a limp hand on the hero's head and tries to grip him with his forelegs. On X the Centaur holds the hero's waist, but on Y the hand already drops.</p>

<p>On the left of the picture, the Centaur uses a wine-jar — a pointed amphora — for a weapon, but before he can bring it down the Lapith thrusts his sword into the Centaur's human belly. Before this, the jar has been broken on the person of a Lapith, or, missing him, on wall or floor.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>In the middle of the other half, the Centaur, with raised fist, grasps a boy cup-bearer by the neck. The boy's wrap is held up in the left hand and hangs momentarily over the right thigh — the same motive, or nearly, as in the Herakles of the inside picture. In X the Centaur's head is in profile: in Y it is in three-quarter view like the boy's: this is an improvement; the two heads form a splendid focus for the picture and are the most attractive piece of drawing in the two cups, recalling coins of the period. The Centaur's hair falls over his forehead instead of back from it as in the other Centaur's. The boy's hair is long too, whereas the older Lapiths have short hair. In favour of X it should be said that it shows the boy's right hand, closed, which is concealed in Y; and also the right foreleg of the Centaur, the lower part of which in Y is simply suppressed. Y, in its turn, has a pair of creases — a favourite late-fifth-century detail — at the bend of the boy's elbow, <pb xml:id="iii.86" n="86"/> which help to make it clear that the arm is seen from the front and not from behind. The attack on the boy cup-bearer is a regular feature of the Centauromachy at the Feast from the beginning, as we know from the West Pediment at Olympia and the volute-krater in New York. On a pelike in Barcelona he is seen fleeing.<note anchored="true" n="iii.86.1"><p>New York: p. 87 no. 3. Barcelona: p. 87 no. 11.</p></note></p>

<p>On the left, a Centaur, armed with a broken wine-jar, has been forced down on his haunches — cornered, one would say — and the Lapith attacks him with an axe. The figure with the axe is also traditional in this scene: again Olympia and the New York krater. According to Hauser the weapon on our vase is a hammer, but it looks more like an axe.</p>

<p>On the right of the picture, the Centaur uses a bronze lampstand as a weapon; the Lapith has a sword. In several of our pictures, one Lapith has a regular weapon — is allowed to have cautiously retained his sword. Lampstands are used in this scene on the calyx-krater by the Nekyia Painter in Vienna.<note anchored="true" n="iii.86.2"><p><rs key="Vienna 1026" type="Vase">Vienna 1026</rs>: p. 87 no. 5.</p></note> Our lampstand is of a general type often represented on vases and known from many Etruscan and other originals.<note anchored="true" n="iii.86.3"><p>Dohrn in <title>RM</title>. 66 pp. 61-63.</p></note> The three feet end in lion's paws, and there is an ivy-leaf in the axil between each pair of feet.</p>

<p>The technique is the same as inside the cup. The Lapiths are all wreathed for the feast: the stem of the wreath, and the berries, are white, the leaves reserved. The only garment — the boy's — has some shading in the hollows of the folds, at least on Y.</p>

<p>We have still to speak of the inscriptions, which are well preserved on X, not at all well on Y. They have been discussed by Edward Robinson in the <title>Museum Report for 1903</title>, p. 49, and by Hauser in FR. iii pp. 43-45.

<p>The two cups in Boston, and the cup with the same signatures in Berlin, are important examples of the florid style of the late fifth century. Aristophanes belongs to the Group of the Meidias Painter. In the best work of the Meidias Painter himself the style attains beauty; in his companions and imitators it does not. Aristophanes is one of those who apply the florid style to the rendering of heroic action, for which it is quite unsuited. There is plenty of movement and spirit in his cups: handsome work; at the first impact, and for a moment, effective.</p>

<p>This is one of four small neck-amphorae, with twisted handles, found at Suessula. A fifth, from another Campanian site, Cumae, is in Naples. The shape is the same in all, and the five are evidently by one potter. The pictures also are by one artist, whom I have called the Suessula Painter after the four (<title>ARV.1</title> pp. 852-3; <title>ARV.2</title> pp. 1344-5). Two of them have recently changed hands and have been republished, so I repeat, with additions, the descriptions of my nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5.</p>

<p>The height of the five vases is about 35 centimetres. The shape is farther from the tradition of the neck-amphora with twisted handles than in the Kadmos Painter's vase (no. 170). This is obvious in the base and foot: the foot is in two degrees, but the upper member, reserved, is very small, and not very distinct from the lower, which spreads a good deal downwards; there is no base-fillet, and the body curves in strongly towards the base. It is almost a bell-krater base and foot. The mouth is in two degrees, but only a slight ridge separates the two. In four of the vases — not in the Naples — the top of the upper member is divided into two thin fillets: as it is in the somewhat earlier neck-amphora with twisted handles in Arezzo,<note anchored="true" n="iii.88.1"><p><rs key="Arezzo 1460" type="Vase">Arezzo 1460</rs>; FR. pl. 67: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 793; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1157 no. 25.</p></note> and in the Suessula Painter's frightful masterpiece, the neck-amphora from Melos in the Louvre (<rs key="Louvre S 1677" type="Vase">Louvre S 1677</rs>).<note anchored="true" n="iii.88.2"><p>FR. pll. 96-97; phots. Giraudon 26991-5: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 832 no. 6; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1344 no. 1.</p></note> The topside of the mouth is reserved. The floral design on the neck is of a type that had long been used in neck-amphorae, but here it is carried out in white: the neck-amphora in Arezzo also has white decoration on the neck, though not floral. Above the pictures, a tongue-pattern of traditional form, but large. Below the pictures, maeander in threes, interrupted by chequer-squares. At the handles, a conventional floral design, without relief-contour, of the same type as on the neck, but in red-figure.</p>
<milestone ed="DBH" unit="card"/>
<p>All these features are shared by the five vases. We now speak of the Boston vase itself. The reverse of the neck is black, without the white palmettes.</p>

<p>The chief subject is a fight, on uneven ground, which is not, however, indicated, as one might have expected, by lines. A young warrior strikes with his sword at a bearded warrior who has fallen on one knee, has lost his sword, and picks up a stone. A third warrior, bearded, backs the first up, he too with a stone in his hand. The fourth person is a young archer, who has just shot. The first three wear chlamys, sandals and stockings, Attic helmet; the archer a chitoniskos, belt, sandals and stockings, and a petasos slung round his neck. The chlamys of the fallen man has a border of spots and above it a wave-pattern; the other chlamydes a thick black border. The archer's chitoniskos, which is a little more than knee-length, is richly decorated: both above and below, it has an ample border consisting of a thick band, with a design, roughly rendered, of sea-horses, between two thinner spotted ones, then a row of long rays. The part of the garment not covered by those borders is strewn with stars and arcs. The quiver hangs from a baldrick at the left flank. The faces and parts of the bodies have relief-contour. The shields are scumbled with brown, except the rim and in two cases a black round in the middle which is charged with a white star. All three helmets have white plumes, and two of the crests are white. The sandals are white, the stockings black.</p>

<p>On the reverse of the vase, a satyr dances, or falls into a dance-posture, as a maenad rushes past with a platter of fruit balanced on her left hand. She is seen from behind, <pb xml:id="iii.89" n="89"/> except the face, but the right foot is drawn as if it were frontal. She wears a peplos, with overfall, over-girt, and embattled border. The attitude of the satyr is one of the schemata of the sikinnis: compare the second satyr from the left on the bell-krater by the Nikias Painter in Gotha,<note anchored="true" n="iii.89.1"><p><title>AJA</title>. 1939 pl. 14; Brommer <title>Satyroi</title> fig. 19; Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 41: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 847 no. 13; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1334 no. 19.</p></note> or the satyr on a Boeotian cup-skyphos, by the Painter of the Athens Argos, in Athens.<note anchored="true" n="iii.89.2"><p><rs key="Athens 1407" type="Vase">Athens 1407</rs>: <title>AM</title>. 65 pl. 13 (Lullies); Brommer <title>Satyrspiele</title> p. 17.</p></note></p>

<p>There is no relief-contour on the reverse. White for the fruit and for the leaves in the maenad's hair.</p>

<p>Of the other four vases, <rs key="New York 44.11.13" type="Vase">New York 44.11.13</rs> stands especially close to ours, and might be called a companion piece. The attitudes of the two principal figures are almost the same, but seen from behind, and the maenad on the reverse is almost a repeat.</p>

<p>All five vases are tawdry work. This is the end of the Attic neck-amphora with twisted handles, and nearly the end of the Attic neck-amphora.</p>

<p>Diameter 0.208, height 0.096. I, Eros on horseback. About 400 B.C., by the Painter of <rs key="London E 130" type="Vase">London E 130</rs> (<title>ARV.1</title> p. 865 no. 2; <title>ARV.2</title> p. 1404 no. 2).</p>

<p>The cup is of Type C. Stout make. Offset lip, decorated inside with a white ivy-wreath, the leaves reserved. The fillet between the thick stem and the base of the bowl is blunt, weak: the potter omitted to tool it off above and below. Torus foot, lipped; the profile of the foot black, except the lip, which is reserved.</p>

<p>The foot has, underneath, a flat offset edge, on which the cup rests: an old idea, found already in many red-figure cups of Type A (Bloesch <title>F.A.S.</title> pll. 8-11) and in Python's cups (ibid. pl. 27). The remainder of the underside is flat, with a black band and two black lines; the inside of the stem is a very narrow funnel. Cups of Type C are rare so late: others are <rs key="London E 110" type="Vase">London E 110</rs> and <rs key="Madrid 11274" type="Vase">Madrid 11274</rs>, both of which have the same foot profile as ours.

<p>The outside of the cup is black. Inside, the 'odd man' of the rough border is northwest. A chubby Eros rides a chubby horse. He wears a wreath, and an ankle-guard ornamented with a spiral. The ankle-guard is the same as is worn by the Sciarra and Mattei Amazons,<note anchored="true" n="iii.89.4"><p>See Friis Johansen in <title>Corolla archaeologica in honorem C. A.

<p>Relief-contour for the face, but for little else. The exergue has no relief-contour.</p>

<p>One does not mind Eros riding a fawn or a dolphin, as he often does: but one rather resents his riding a horse: one feels that since he has wings he should fly not ride. And in fact he is seldom seen on horseback, and not until the fourth century, when he rides a horse on three other cups, two by the Meleager Painter in the Louvre, and a third by another corruptus in Ferrara,<note anchored="true" n="iii.89.6"><p><rs key="Louvre C 10983" type="Vase">Louvre C 10983</rs> and <rs key="Louvre C 11925" type="Vase">Louvre C 11925</rs> (<title>ARV.2</title> pp. 1412-13 nos. 60 and 61); <rs key="Ferrara T. 725" type="Vase">Ferrara T. 725</rs>.</p></note> also on a number of pelikai.</p>

<p>The small cup is of delicate make and unusual shape. The inside of the offset lip is ornamented with an ivy-wreath, the stem and berries of which are white, the leaves reserved. The bowl is reeded outside. It is separated from the stem by a large black fillet, with a reserved line near the top. The profile of the foot is black, and is divided by a groove into two thin mouldings of which the upper is the larger and definitely a torus. The underside of the foot is black, with three reserved bands. The handles are not worthy of the rest.</p>

<p>The shape is descended from the 'Acrocup' (see <ref target="ii.67" n="U">ii p. 67</ref>; <rs key="Boston 03.815" type="Vase">Boston 03.815</rs>), or rather it is an Acrocup influenced by metal originals such as the silver cup (with gold medallion) from the Chmyrev grave (<title>Anz</title>. 1910 p. 219 figs. 18-19).

<p>The picture on the Boston cup is unique. Within a line border, which is rather roughly drawn, and on a reserved exergue, Sparte, <foreign xml:lang="greek">*S[*P]*A*R*T*H</foreign>, dismounts from her horse at an altar. She holds the reins in her right hand, and lays her left on the horse's hind-quarters as she slips from its back. The horse's right fore-hoof is still raised from the ground; one expects to see the left fore-hoof, but it is not shown. Sparte wears a thin peplos, girt at the waist, without apoptygma. A himation hangs over her left shoulder, where one corner <pb xml:id="iii.91" n="91"/> of it is seen, and falls behind her and along her left side, where another corner appears to right of her left ankle. A third corner shows between her feet, and some of the folds between the shanks belong to the himation, although it is not quite clear where chiton begins and himation ends. Similarly to right of the left cheek, the himation looks as if it were about to pass over the back of the head, but this cannot be so. Necklace, bracelets and ear-ring are in relief and once were gilded. The hair, mounded high over the forehead, is rendered by wavy lines in darker brown on a light background. The upright relief-line on the body of the altar serves to indicate the side, but this three-quarter view is not continued above or below. A ball of incense, as it must be, in white, lies on the altar; the reins and the inscription are also in white. Relief-contours, except for part of the altar.</p>

<p>The horse is a small pony, with hogged mane and the short insignificant head which is common in the horses of the late fifth century and of the fourth. Much the same type of animal as on no. 174. The tip of the tail is restored. The drawing of the woman has genuine charm, rare in vases of this period. The exergue is marred by a brown blot.</p>

<p>On figures of persons dismounting from horses see Haspels <title>ABL</title>. pp. 52-54.</p>

<p>Sparte, according to the version of Spartan origins reported by Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 3.1.2">Paus. 3.1.2</bibl>) and hardly of great age, was daughter of Eurotas, wife of Lakedaimon, and mother of Amyklas. Her head appears on Spartan coins of the Roman period. Long before that, a figure of Sparte, holding a lyre, formed the support of a large bronze tripod, by Aristandros of Paris, at Amyklai, one of two dedicated in commemoration of the Spartan victory at Aigospotamoi (<bibl n="Paus. 3.18.8">Paus. 3.18.8</bibl>), so not long after 405 B.C., and very near the period of our vase. That Sparte should figure on an Attic vase has always been thought remarkable, and Hauser recognized that the choice is probably connected with the brief spell of Spartan popularity at Athens in the years about 400.<note anchored="true" n="iii.91.1"><p><title>RM</title>. 17 p. 248.</p></note> Corbett has recently considered the matter when publishing another unique monument, a fragment of an Attic bell-krater, found in the Agora of Athens, inscribed before firing with the name of Leonidas,<note anchored="true" n="iii.91.2"><p><rs key="Athens, Agora P 17000" type="Vase">Athens, Agora P 17000</rs>: <title>Hesp</title>. 18 pl. 4 with pp. 104-7.</p></note> and he concludes that such a philolaconian inscription would scarcely have been possible except between the years 403 and 395 or even 397. The same applies to the cup in Boston. It agrees with this that a cup of very similar shape was found in the grave of the Lacedaemonians who fell at Athens in 403 B.C. (<ref target="iii.90" n="U">iii p. 90</ref> no. 3; vase description for <rs key="Boston 00.354" type="Vase">Boston 00.354</rs>). Another possible trace of Laconism at this time is mentioned above on <ref target="iii.83" n="U">iii p. 83</ref> (<rs key="Boston 03.821" type="Vase">Boston 03.821</rs>).</p>

<p>We must try to explain the particular figuration of Sparte on the Boston cup. According to Hauser the altar is Athena's, on the Acropolis of Athens, and Sparte has ridden to it across country. More probably, as Matz says,<note anchored="true" n="iii.91.3"><p><title>Naturpersonifikationen</title> pp. 64-68.</p></note> it is Sparte's own altar, which she comes to visit; and we may compare the later cup in Vienna, where Artemis rides to her altar on a doe.<note anchored="true" n="iii.91.4"><p><rs key="Vienna 203" type="Vase">Vienna 203</rs>: La Borde 2 pl. 26, 1, whence <title>El</title>. 2 pl. 8; <title>RM</title>. 42 Beil. 24, above; <title>CV</title>. pl. 30, 4 and pl. 31, 3: <title>ARV.1</title> p. 887, Painter of <rs key="Vienna 202" type="Vase">Vienna 202</rs>, no. 2.</p></note> But why is Sparte on horseback? Ashmole reminds me that according to Pausanias (<bibl n="Paus. 6.2.1">Paus. 6.2.1</bibl>), 'after the Persian invasion the Spartans were keener horse-breeders than all the rest of the Greeks'. Castor was <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppo/damos</foreign> to Homer and <foreign xml:lang="greek">difrhla/ths</foreign> to Pindar (<bibl n="Pind. I. 1">Pind. I. 1.16-17</bibl>). In the feigned chariot-race at Delphi in the <title>Electra</title> of Sophocles, one of the competitors is Spartan (<bibl n="Soph. El. 701">Soph. El. 701</bibl>). Spartans won many victories in the equestrian events at Olympia (<bibl n="Paus. 4.1">Paus. 4.1.6-2.3</bibl>), and at this very time Kyniska, daughter of King Archidamos II and sister of King Agesilaos II, may have been training horses, since she won the chariot-race either in 396 or 392 or not very long after.<note anchored="true" n="iii.91.5"><p>Hiller von Gaertringen <title>Historische griechische Epigramme</title> p. 26 no. 63.</p></note> Reason, then, for depicting Sparta as an equestrian. Moreover, one might guess that our picture was not an original creation, but derived from another work of art — votive picture, or rather, perhaps, metal relief, for instance on a mirror-case — which stood in a closer relation to a Spartan <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppotro/fos</foreign> — or <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ppotrofou=sa</foreign>.</p>
