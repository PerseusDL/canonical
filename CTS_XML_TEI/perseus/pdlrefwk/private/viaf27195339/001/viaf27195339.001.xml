   <head>Preface</head>
   <p>THE project of compiling a Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome
    had for many years been in the mind of the late Professor Platner, and
    before the Great War he had already invited my collaboration. Whereas,
    however, I was unable at that time to take any share in its preparation,
    he, having been rejected for service in Europe on grounds of health, despite
    repeated attempts to take an active part in the war, even before the entry
    of the United States, applied himself to the task with characteristic energy.
    In June 1920, he was able to write to me that he had 85 to 90 per cent.
    of the matter done; and in August 1921, he sailed for Europe with his
    wife in order to give the book its finishing touches by a few months' work
    in Rome, in which I was looking forward to being associated with him, and
    especially to discussing the many problems which could only be examined
    on the spot, and settling the line which should be taken in regard to the
    adoption of one solution or another. A sudden illness, however, overtook
    him on the voyage, and in twenty-four hours he was dead. Mrs. Platner
    lost no time in placing the typescript in my hands for completion and
    preparation for press: and I accept unreservedly the entire responsibility
    for the long delay that has occurred in its publication, which has of necessity
    made my own task considerably heavier. Besides completing the work as
    it was handed to me by the compilation (1) of the articles on aqueducts,
    gates, and roads, which had been allotted to me from the first, (2) of a
    number of important and difficult articles relating especially to the Forum
    and Palatine, such as Basilica Aemilia, Comitium, Curia, Domus Augustiana,
    Domus Aurea, Forum   Romanum, Palatinus Mons, Rostra, etc., which
    Professor Platner had obviously intended to write during or after his visit
    to Rome (for no drafts of them were in existence), I felt bound to check the
    whole text carefully, verify all the references, and add such additional
    information as I myself possessed or as came to light subsequently. As a
    result, my own share in the work may now be estimated at from 20 to
    25 per cent. On the other hand, it is no inconsiderable advantage, I think,
    that I have been able to include references to a number of important works
    that have appeared in the interval, such as Professor Hiilsen's Chiese di
    Roma, which he was good enough to allow me to see in proof. But that is
    the least part of the debt of gratitude that is due to Professor Hulsen.
    He has read the book through twice, in slip and in page proof, and has
    made a very large number of most valuable suggestions, which, where
    <pb n="vi"/>
    they have not yet found their way into print, are quoted by his name. In this way the veteran scholar, whose seventieth birthday we celebrate to-day, has paid the best tribute in his power to the memory of the late Professor Platner, whose esteem for him was shown by the dedication of his Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome, the first edition of which dates from 1904, Christiano Huelseno Topographiae urbis Romae Antiquae magistro peritissimo. Personally, I cannot find words to express my indebtedness to one who, with Professor Lanciani, has been my master in Roman Topography for over thirty years.</p>
   <p>      
    But my obligations do not end there. So truly had Professor Platner
    gauged the need for such a work that the news of its impending publication roused keen interest in the minds of many scholars: and no less than five more of them have been good enough to read through the proofs: Dr. Gilbert Bagnani, Professor Giuseppe Lugli (the author of The Classical Monuments of Rome and its Vicinity, vol. i. The 'Zona Archaeolgica '), Mr. H. M. Last, Mrs. S. Arthur Strong, and Professor A. W. Van Buren To all of them I offer my grateful thanks for the service which they have
    done to the book, and especially to the first named, who has compiled the
    'Chronological Index to Dateable Monuments' which will be found at
    the end.</p>
   <p>     
    I am much indebted to Mr. I. A. Richmond for various suggestions in regard to the Aurelian walls and their gates.   His forthcoming work on the subject, The City Wall of Imperial Rome, which I have had the advantage of seeing in MS., will treat of the subject in full detail.</p>
   <p>     
    No attempt has been made to distinguish Professor Platner's original text from any alterations or additions that have been made to it. I must, however, assume full responsibility for the footnotes and addenda, and in these the rare divergencies of opinion between us are indicated, sometimes,
    but seldom, by the addition of my initials.</p>
   <p>     
    But even with all the help I have received, and despite the time and care that has been bestowed on proof correction by others besides myself, I cannot pretend that a work so full of quotations and references, a mass of minute detail, can possibly be free from numerous errors. And with a view of inviting the help of scholars towards making the work more perfect, it has been arranged that copies should be obtainable interleaved at a slight additional cost: so that, if the book ever attains the distinction of a second edition, it may be made more useful by enlisting the aid of as many students of the subject as are willing to co-operate.</p>
   <p>     
    Finality, and even completeness, in such a subject as the present is
    of course an impossible ideal. To take only a single instance, the serious
    student of topography is greatly handicapped by the lack of scientific reports
    on the great bulk of the excavations conducted on the Forum and on the
    Palatine by the late Commendatore Giacomo Boni during the past twenty
    years: and though the publication of his results has been placed in the
    hands of a competent commission, which has appointed Professor Alfonso
    <pb n="vii"/>
    Bartoli to undertake the task, it will of necessity take a considerable time.
    Nor is the formation of a new plan of Rome a profitable enterprise at the
    present moment. The Marble Plan of Rome, which was provisionally put
    together by the efforts of Hulsen and Lanciani for the Historical Congress
    of 1903,<note anchored="true" place="foot">See Atti del Congesso di Scienze Storiche, <bibl>(1907)</bibl>, i. 112; DAP 2. xi. 119, 120.
    </note> is now being subjected to a thorough study by a competent committee, of which the former is a prominent member. Further excavation
    is necessary, in order to make sure that no further fragments are hidden
    beneath the mass of debris that covers the south-east corner of the Forum
    Pacis (see p. 387), and without their aid, it may be difficult to gain a great
    amount of additional information. But until the attempt has been made,
    the revision of Lanciani's great plan, the Forma Urbis Romae, published
    in 1893-1901, cannot be satisfactorily undertaken.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. Rendiconti dei Lincei, 1912, 107.
    </note> In this connexion
    I may perhaps be allowed to express the earnest hope that the publication
    of the Storia degli Scavi of Lanciani, which now goes as far as the death
    of Clement VIII (Aldobrandini) in 1605, may soon be continued.</p>
   <p>     
    From the considerations adduced, it will be clear that the moment is not yet ripe for a general treatise on the topography of the city, nor indeed would such an undertaking be advisable for a considerable time.</p>
   <p>     
    Mrs. Platner has throughout taken the keenest interest in the preparation of the work for press, and its publication at a price within the reach of students would not have been possible without the liberal subvention which she has placed at the disposal of the Delegates of the Press.</p>
   <p>     
    For the illustrations themselves I have to record my obligations to Messrs. Allyn and Bacon, of Boston, U.S.A., the publishers of Professor Platner's earlier work, who have generously supplied electrotypes from the original blocks which figured in that work; and to the Italian Ministry of Public Instruction, the German Archaeological Institute, the Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Miss D. L. Blaisdell, Miss Dora E. Bulwer, the late Mr. W. A. Casson, Mr. Percival Hart, the late Mr. J. H. Ten Eyck Burr, and the firms of Alinari and Anderson of Rome, for various photographs which they have kindly permitted me to reproduce.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See the lists, pp. xi-xiii. Several of them were taken some time since, and have been purposely selected as being more interesting.
    </note>But when all is said and done, it is to Professor Platner that the work owes its inception and the greater part of its execution: and it may fairly be hoped that its usefulness to students will be such that it will long keep his memory alive even among those who had not the great privilege of his friendship. What that meant to his colleagues is well expressed in the Memorial adopted by the Faculty of Adelbert College of Western Reserve University, of which he had been for thirty-six years a member, which aptly closes with the words: <foreign xml:lang="la">Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus tam cari capitis</foreign> <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Much of the foregoing has appeared in the Atti del I Congresso Nazionale di Studi Romani, held at Rome in April 1928.

   <p>THE method of quotation from periodicals is that followed by Professor
    Platner himself in his earlier work, but many other abbreviations have been
    introduced; and, in order to effect a further saving in space, the names of
    the authors of articles have as a rule been omitted.<note anchored="true" place="foot">This has not been done with any idea of denying to their authors the credit that is
     fairly due to them: but, in order to meet the criticism brought by Cantarelli against
     Professor Platner in regard to this matter (<bibl>BC 1905, 286</bibl>; <bibl>1911, 307</bibl>), it may be pointed
     out that it would have been necessary, for consistency's sake, to give the names of the
     writers of articles in encyclopaedias such as DE, DS, and RE, which would have added
     still further to the bulk of what is already a quite sufficiently large and costly volume.
    </note> Further, it has not
    been thought necessary to refer to the accounts of the same discovery in
    both the Notizie degli Scavi and the Bullettino Comunale, except when (as
    sometimes happens) one account tacitly corrects or supplements the other,
    so that scholars cannot safely refrain from consulting both.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See my remarks in <bibl>PBS iii. 3</bibl>, 4, 41, n. 2.
    </note>While I am
    on this subject, I may remark that those writers who introduce new and
    more accurate modes of subdivision or quotation often display singularly
    little consideration for the convenience of students.   Thus Schreiber, in
    his republication of Vacca's Memorie,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Schsische Berichte, 1881, 43 sqq.</note> quite correctly divides No. 60 into
    two parts: but instead of calling the second half No. 60a, he starts a new
    numbering for the later Memorie, without adding a comparative numbering
    in the margin, which causes the greatest inconvenience to those students
    who are not fortunate enough to possess a copy of his article.   In the
    text I have given Fea's numbering (Miscellanea, i. 52 sqq.) and Schreiber's
    in brackets where it differs.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> As an instance where I have myself been led into confusion I may refer to the Catalogue
     of the Museo Capitolino, where on p. 21 the numbering is Fea's, and on p. 38 Schreiber's.
    </note></p>
   <p>It should be remembered that, even if the methods used in the older
    books are erroneous and require gradual supersession, the student may lose
    a good deal of valuable time if they are not at first retained as well as the
    new ones.</p>
   <p>It is, for instance, a great pity that both Jordan and Urlichs should in
    the same year have published the text of the Mirabilia, with a slightly
    different numbering of the chapters. I have in this case followed the
    former.</p>
   <p>Nor does it often happen that authors who publish second editions of
    their works are considerate enough to give the paging of the first in the
    <pb n="xvi"/>
    margin. Wissowa's Religion und Kultus der Romer is one of the works
    which has given me most trouble in the preparation of the present
    book.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> I must express my own regret that I have not inserted references to Dessau's invaluable Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae throughout, as well as to CIL.
    </note></p>
   <p>And there are other aids to students which are urgently needed. I myself feel that it might have been useful to add to the present work a list of the false denominations of the buildings of Rome-of those names which have been current from Renaissance times or even earlier,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> e.g. Palatium Decii, a name which comes from the interpolated acta of S. Lorenzo
    (cf. HJ 376; HCh 292).
   </note> and which, though now demonstrably incorrect, will yet be found in many of the books, especially those of a century or two back, which may fall into the hands of the advanced scholar. Certainly the need is even greater in regard to works of art: for, if modern criticism has discovered that a statue which, for example, has been known from the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> up to the last few years as an Antinous, is in reality an Apollo, one may search in vain for it under its old and commonly current denomination in the index to any museum catalogue. Of course, on the other hand, I have no desire to encourage the uncritical acceptance of these rejected appellations. For example, the existence of a temple of Juno Martialis near the Forum is maintained by Pichler (Numism. <bibl>Zeitschr. v. (1873) 92-101</bibl>), who is followed by Bernhart (Handbuch zur Munzkunde, 126): but the assertion that it was in Rome is made by no better an authority than the so-called Sextus Rufus (Richter 9). It is a pity that a presumably up-to-date numismatic work (though Roman topography is not the author's strong point) should insert a statement which acts on so insecure an authority.</p>
   <p>As a contrast, Von Domaszewski's criticism   of the topographical
    allusions in the Scriptores Historiae Augustae errs, perhaps, on the side of
    undue severity. I have generally quoted him in the several articles: but
    it may be worth while to refer to his discussion once more in a general way.<note anchored="true" place="foot">'Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger Akademie, 1916, Abh. 7, 15; 1917, Abh. 1; 1918,
     Abh. 6, 13 ; 920, Abh. 6. An index of passages discussed, at the end of the last article,
     makes reference easy.
    </note>
    Whether he is right in considering all the biographies to be the work of a
    single author, who was the curator of a library known as the Bibliotheca
    Ulpia, situated in the thermae Traianae at Nemausus (Nimes), and posterior
    in date to the Gaulish poets of the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century A.D.</dateRange>, may well be questioned.
    And he is certainly going too far in suggesting that all the topographical
    information which is not directly copied from other authors was taken from
    a commentator who had before him a plan of Rome <note anchored="true" place="foot"> He adds that the author may even have had this plan before him in the porticus
     attached to the library !
    </note> drawn under Antoninus
    Pius, on which the Aurelian Wall had later been added. But even Hohl,
    who sharply criticizes Von Domaszewski's views in regard to the date and
    composition of this work, is ready to allow ' that the articles on the topo-
    <pb n="xvii"/>
    graphy of Rome, etc., contain many remarks on points of detail which
    deserve consideration.' <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Bursian's Jahresbericht, cc, 197.
    </note></p>
   <p>An inevitable consequence of the adoption of the system of a dictionary
    has been the omission of such discoveries as cannot be associated with any
    building the ancient name of which is known to us. The most striking
    example is the house found near the Villa Farnesina, not far from the
    tomb of C. Sulpicius Platorinus, which has yielded to the Museo delle Terme
    the beautiful stuccoes and wall-paintings of the Augustan period which are
    among its chief treasures.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Paribeni passim (cf. esp. p. 186). Other examples will be found in <bibl>NS 1922, 222-226</bibl>,
     and <bibl>BC 1926, 235-269</bibl>.
    </note> These of course would have found their place
    in a complete topographical manual, which might also have on occasion
    gone beyond the Aurelian Wall, which has been taken as the general limit.
    On the other hand, I have made considerable additions to the list of domus,
    after going carefully through the inscriptions on lead pipes published in
    CIL xv. and have admitted far more names than Hulsen had included in the
    Nomenclator attached to KH.</p>
   <p> 
    I would add in explanation that when a pipe is found on the top of an
    isolated hill like the Capitol or Aventine, there is some considerable presumption that the building to which it led was not far off: while in regard
    to other pipes I have thought it worth while to add a number of names
    that had previously been omitted, even though they did not allow of the
    exact fixing of the site of the house. I should probably not have done this
    had CIL xv. been indexed. It may freely be admitted that a good many
    of the names entered under domus might as well have been placed under
    horti, especially those on pipes found on the right bank of the Tiber.</p>
   <p>In the text, a star immediately after the name means that the Addenda
    et Corrigenda should be consulted.</p>

Its location is not certainly known, though some authors (LR 167-170; <bibl>BC 1910, 1-41</bibl>; ZA 219-220) place it at the east angle of the Palatine, in the large area known as Vigna Barberini (see <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>).   On the other hand, on grounds of material, it appears that the fragment will not fit in at this part of the plan (DAP 2. xi. 113-118); and, if this is so, its site must be considered quite uncertain (HJ 87; <bibl>Mitt. 1890, 77</bibl>; <bibl>1896, 206</bibl>).</p>

</head>
<p> the temple of Aesculapius erected on the island in the Tiber soon after <date value="-291">291 B.C.</date> In consequence of a pestilence in Rome in <date value="-293">293</date> an embassy was sent to Epidaurus in 292 to bring back the statue of the god Aesculapius. This embassy returned in 291, bringing not the statue, but a serpent from Epidaurus that, on reaching Rome, abandoned the ship and swam to the island (<bibl>Liv. x. 47</bibl>; xi. ep.; Val. <bibl>Max. i. 8</bibl>. 2 <foreign xml:lang="la">in ripam Tiberis egressis legatis in insulam... transnavit</foreign>) ; Ovid. <bibl>Met. xv. 736-741</bibl>; Plut. q.R. 94; Plin. <bibl>NH xxix. 72</bibl>; de vir. ill. 22). According to another tradition the first temple was built extra urbem, the second in insula (Plin. <bibl>NH xxix. 16</bibl>; Rend. <bibl>Linc. 1917, 573-580</bibl>; <bibl>AJA 1919, 431</bibl>). The whole island was consecrated to Aesculapius (see <ref target="insula-tiberina" n="U">INSULA TIBERINA</ref>), the temple built, and dedicated on 1st January (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 290-292</bibl>; Hemerol. Praen. Ian. 1; CIL i 2. p. 305; Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS. 1921, 83</bibl>). It was usually called aedes, but also templum (Val. <bibl>Max. i. 8</bibl>. 2; Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 290</bibl>; de vir. ill. 22; Plin. cit.), fanum (<bibl>Liv. xliii. 4</bibl>), and <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)asklpiei=a</foreign> in Greek (<bibl>Dionys. v. 13</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 2</bibl>. 3.</note> Besides being the centre of the cult and of the sanatorium that developed on the island (Fest. 110), this temple, being outside the pomerium, was also used as a place for the reception of foreign ambassadors, as those of Perseus in <date value="-170">170 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. xli. 22</bibl>), and for such meetings as that between the senators and Gulussa (<bibl>Liv. xlii. 24</bibl>). From a  reference in Varro (<bibl>LL vii. 57</bibl> <foreign xml:lang="la">equites pictos vidi in Aesculapii aede vetere et ferentarios adscriptos</foreign>; Urlichs, Malerei vor Caesar 10) and some inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 6</bibl>, 7, 12) it appears certain that the first temple was rebuilt or restored towards the end of the republic; perhaps when the pons Fabricius was built in <date value="-62">62 B.C.</date> the first temple was decorated with frescoes (Varro, loc. cit.; <bibl>Liv. xliii. 4</bibl>). It is altogether probable that there was further restoration during the empire, perhaps under Antoninus Pius (HJ 144), but there is no direct evidence therefor (cf. Besnier, L'Ile Tiberine 176, 191-192; <bibl>JRS 1911, 187-195</bibl>).</p>
<p>There are no certain remains of this temple, but it probably occupied the site of the present church of S. Bartolomeo, and some of the columns of the nave probably belonged to the temple or its porticus. A considerable number of inscriptions relating to the temple or to votive offerings in it

 have been found in the vicinity (<bibl>CIL vi. 7-20</bibl>; <note anchored="true" place="foot"> <bibl>CIL vi. 7</bibl>=12. 8oo=ILS 3836. <bibl>CIL vi. 1080</bibl>=31236 is referred to this locality and to Caracalla by von Domaszewski (<bibl>SHA 1918, 13</bibl>. A. 140): cf. also the coins of L. Rubrius Dossenus (B.M. <bibl>Rep. i. 312</bibl>. 2459 sqq.).

</note> 30842-30846; <bibl>IG xiv. 966</bibl>),  and many terracottas, most of which have been dispersed. A signum Aesculapii (Suet.

<placeName>  AMPHITHEATRUM</placeName>
</head>
<p> a form of building that originated, apparently, in Campania, but was developed in Rome after the end of the republic. It was widely diffused throughout Italy, and has always been regarded as a distinctly Roman structure. It was intended primarily for gladiatorial contests and venationes, which had previously taken place in the forum. Around the open area of the forum temporary seats had been erected, forming an irregular ellipse. This was the reason for the shape of the amphitheatre, and for the name itself which means 'having seats on all sides.' This word, however, does not occur before the Augustan era, and was at first applied to the circus also (Dion. <bibl>Hal. iv. 44</bibl>); in the inscription on the building at Pompeii (the earliest extant example) we find spectacula used(SJ 128).</p>
<p>The amphitheatres erected in the city of Rome itself were the following:</p>

<p>It was elliptical in form, with axes 88.5 and 78 metres in length, and constructed entirely of brick and brick-faced concrete. The exterior wall consisted of three stories of open arcades, adorned with pilasters and Corinthian capitals. When the Aurelian wall was built, the amphitheatre was utilized as a part of the line of fortification, the wall being joined to it in the middle of the east and west sides. The outer half of the building was thus made a projecting bastion, and the open arcades of the exterior  were walled up, the ground level outside being at the same time lowered. The inner half was evidently pulled down, so that little use can have been made of the edifice at that time.</p>
<p>Drawings of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> represent all three stories, but since that time the upper one has entirely disappeared and all but a few fragments of the second.

Vespasian carried the structure to the top of the second arcade of the outer wall and of the maenianum secundum   of the cavea (see below), and dedicated it before his death in <date value="79">79 A.D.</date> (Chronogr. a. 354, P. 146).

Abr. 2095; <bibl>Eutrop. vii. 21</bibl>; Cohen, Tit. 399, 400).   Domitian is said to have completed the building ad clipea (Chron. ib.) which probably refers to the bronze shields that were placed directly beneath the uppermost cornice (cf. Cohen, Tit. 399) and to additions on the inside <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Leopold (Med. Nederl. Hist. Inst. <bibl>Rome. iv. (1924) 39-76</bibl>) thinks that Vespasian's
work extended as far as the top of the Corinthian arcade. Von Gerkan carried the same
idea further, adding a number of observations in detail. (See <bibl>Mitt. 1925, 11-50</bibl>.) But
the relief of the Haterii, in which the arch of Titus is shown (see p. 45 n. 2), cannot
possibly be used as evidence for the condition of the amphitheatre at the end of the reign
of Vespasian. As Hulsen has pointed out, Titus came to the throne in June, 79, while
the inscription of the Arvales as to the distribution of the seats belongs to June or July,
80; and it is quite enough to credit him with the completion of the third and fourth
stories on already established lines, without supposing that he also made fundamental
alterations in what Vespasian had already built.
</note>  (HJ 282).</p>
<p>        There are indications of changes or additions by Nerva and Trajan(<bibl>CIL vi. 32254-5</bibl>; for the inscription of the former see Spinazzola, Anfiteatro Flavio <bibl>(Naples, 1907)</bibl> 27 sqq.), and it was restored by Antoninus Pius (Hist. Aug. Pius 8). In 217 it was struck by lightning (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxviii. 25</bibl>), and so seriously damaged that no more gladiatorial combats could be held in the building until 222-223, when the repairs begun by Elagabalus (Hist. Aug. Elagab. 17) were at least partially completed by Alexander Severus (Hist. Aug. Alex. Sev. 24; Cohen, Alex. Sev. 468, 469), although they seem to have continued into the reign of Gordianus III (Hist. Aug. Max. et <bibl>Balb. i. 4</bibl>; Cohen, Gord. III. 165, 166). In 250 the building was presumably   restored by   Decius, after a fire caused by another stroke of lightning (Hieron. a. Abr. 2268). It was injured by the earthquake of 442 (Paul. Diac. hist. <bibl>Rom. xiii. 16</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1917, 13-17</bibl>), and restorations by different officials are recorded in the years immediately succeeding (<bibl>CIL vi. 32086-32089</bibl>), and again in 470 (<bibl>CIL vi. 32091-2</bibl>, 32188-9).   Some of the inscriptions set up on the former occasion in honour of Theodosius II and Valentinian III were cut on marble blocks which had originally served as seats. Repairs were made after another

<pb n="7"/>
earthquake by the prefect Basilius, who was probably consul in 508 (<bibl>CIL vi. 32094</bibl>), and finally by Eutharich, the son-in-law of Theodoric, in preparation for the last recorded venationes, which took place in 523 (Cassiod.
<bibl>Var. v. 42</bibl>). The last gladiatorial combats occurred in 404 (<bibl>Theodoret
v. 26</bibl>).</p>
<p>The Colosseum   was injured by an earthquake in the pontificate of Leo IV   (in 847). In the eleventh and twelfth centuries houses and
isolated 'cryptae ' within the Colosseum are frequently mentioned in documents of the archives of S. Maria Nova, as though it were already in ruins
(Arch. Soc. Rom. St. <bibl>Patr. xxiii. (1900) 204</bibl>, 216; xxv. <bibl>(1902)</bibl> ; xxvi. <bibl>(1903)</bibl> 38, 41, 57, 79). Gradual destruction continued until the <dateRange from="1700" to="1799">eighteenth century</dateRange>, while the work of restoration has gone on intermittently since the beginning of the nineteenth (De Angelis, Relazione 8-15). The north side of the outer wall is standing, comprising the arches numbered xxiii to LIV, with that part of the building which is between it and the inner wall supporting the colonnade, and practically the whole skeleton of the structure between this inner wall and the arena-that is, the encircling and radiating walls on which the cavea with its marble seats rested. The marble seats and lining of the cavea, together with everything in the nature of decoration,' have disappeared.</p>
<p>The amphitheatre (111.3) is elliptical in form. Its main axis, running north-west-south-east, is 188 metres in length, and its minor axis 156. The exterior is constructed of large blocks of travertine-a fact that contributed greatly to the astonishment of Constantius (Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 14); and in the interior Vespasian erected a skeleton of travertine blocks where the greatest pressure had to be resisted, which was not carried higher than the second story (Ill. 4). The remainder of the inner walls are of blocks of and of concrete, with and without brick facing, the former being used where there was more pressure. Some tufa and sperone is also employed in the lower part of the inner walls. The outer wall, or facade, is 48.50 metres high, and stands upon a stylobate, which is raised two steps a pavement of travertine. This pavement is 17.50 metres wide, extended around the whole building. Its outer edge is marked by a row of stone cippi-five of which on the east side are in situ (<bibl>BC 1895, 117-119</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1895, 101</bibl>, 227)-with holes cut on the inner side to hold the ends of barriers connecting these posts with the wall of the building.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It seems more likely that the barrier was concentric; for there are no corresponding
arrangements on the piers of the building itself to hold the other ends of the beams.
These would have been supported by iron rings fixed in the holes in the cippi (<bibl>Mitt. 1925,
12-13</bibl>).
</note> The outer wall itself is divided into four stories, of which the lower three consist of rows of open arcades, a style of architecture borrowed from the theatre of Marcellus. The arches of the lower arcade are 7.05 metres high and 4.20 wide; the pillars between them are 2.40 metres wide and 2.70 deep. In front of these pillars are engaged columns of the Doric order, which support an entablature 2.35 metres high, but without the distinguishing
<pb n="8"/>
characteristics of this order. There were eighty arches in the lower arcade, of which the four at the ends of the two axes formed the main entrances to the amphitheatre, and were unnumbered. The remaining seventy-six were numbered (<bibl>CIL vi. 1796</bibl>f = 32263), the numbers being cut on the facade just beneath the architrave. Above the entablature is an attic of the same height, with projections above the columns, which serve as pedestals for the engaged columns of the second arcade. This arcade has the same dimensions as the lowest, except that the arches are only 6.45 metres high. The half-columns are of the Ionic order, and in turn support an entablature 2.10 metres in height, but not in perfect Ionic style. Above this is a second attic, 1.95 metres high, on which the columns of the third arcade rest. The last is of the Corinthian order, and its arches are 6.40 metres high. Above this is a third entablature and attic. In each of the second and third arcades was a statue.</p>
<p>The attic above the third arcade is 2.10 metres high, and is pierced by small rectangular windows over every second arch. On it rests the
upper division of the wall, which is solid and adorned with flat Corinthian
pilasters in place of the half-columns of the lower arcades, but shows
numerous traces of rude reconstruction in the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange> (Lanciani,
Destruction of Ancient Rome, figs. 9, 10). Above the pilasters is an
entablature, and between every second pair of pilasters is a window cut
through the wall-<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1897, 334</bibl>-; <bibl>1925, 30-33</bibl>. In the remaining spaces between the pilasters the
clipea were fixed (Colagrossi, Anfiteatro Flavio, 45-47: 257-264).
</note>(see below, p. 9).   Above these openings is a row of
consoles-three between each pair of pilasters. In these consoles are
sockets for the masts which projected upward through corresponding
holes in the cornice and supported the awnings (velaria) that protected
the cavea (Hist. Aug. Comm. 15; cf. Mau, Pompeii, 223, Fig. III).</p>
<p>Within this outer wall, at a distance of 5.80 metres, is a second wall with
corresponding arches; and 4.50 metres inside of this a third which divides
the building into two main sections. On the lower floor, between these
three walls, are two lofty arched corridors or ambulatories, encircling the
entire building; on the second floor, two corridors like those below,
except that the inner one is divided into two, an upper and a lower; and
on the third floor two more. In the inner corridor on the second floor, and
in both on the third, are flights of steps very ingeniously arranged, which
lead to the topmost story, and afford access to the upper part of the second
tier of seats. Within the innermost of the three walls just mentioned
are other walls parallel to it, and radiating walls, struck from certain points
within the oval and perpendicular to its circumference. These radiating
walls correspond in number to the piers of the lower arcade, and are
divided into three parts, so as to leave room for two more corridors round
the building. This system of radiating walls supported the sloping floor
(cavea) on which the rows of marble seats (gradus) were placed. Underneath, in corridors and arches, are other flights of steps which lead to all
<pb n="9"/>
parts of the cavea, through openings called vomitoria. They are arranged
in fours.</p>
<p>The arena itself is elliptical, the major axis being 86 metres long and the minor 54. All round the arena was a fence, built to protect the spectators from the attacks of the wild beasts, and behind it a narrow passage paved with marble. Above this passage was the podium, a platform   raised about 4 metres above the arena, on which were placed the marble chairs of the most distinguished spectators. These chairs seem to have been assigned to corporations and officials, not to individuals as such, until the time of Constantine, when they began to be assigned to families an rarely to individuals. This continued until the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange>, when possession by individuals became more common. The names of these various owners were cut in the pavement of the podium, on the seats themselves, and above the cornice, and many of these inscriptions have been preserved (<bibl>CIL vi. 32099-32248</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1880, 211-282</bibl>). When a seat passed from one owner to another, the old name was erased and a new one substituted. The front of the podium   was protected by a bronze balustrade.</p>
<p> From the podium <note anchored="true" place="foot"> It should be added that the wall with niches is on the outer side of the vaulted passage
which supported the podium.</note> the cavea sloped upward as far as the innermost of the three walls described above. It was divided into sections (maeniana) by curved passages and low walls (praecinctiones, baltei ; the lower section (maenianum primum) contained about twenty rows of seats (gradus) and the upper section   (maenianum   secundum), further   subdivided   into maenianum superius and inferius, about sixteen. These maeniana were also divided into cunei, or wedge-shaped sections, by the steps and aisles from   the vomitoria. The gradus were covered with marble, and when assigned to particular corporations the name was cut on the stone. Eleven such inscriptions have been found (<bibl>CIL vi. 32098</bibl> a-i, l, m), and indicateD that space was assigned by measure and not according to the number of persons (cf. the assignment to the Fratres Arvales, CILvi. 2059 =32363). Each individual seat could, however, be exactly designated by its gradus, cuneus and number, as was done elsewhere.</p>
<p> Behind the maenianum secundum the wall rose to a height of 5 metreS above the cavea, and was pierced with doors and windows communicating with the corridor behind. On this wall was a Corinthian colonnade, which together with the outer wall, supported a flat roof. The columns were of cipollino and granite, dating from   the Flavian period.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This, given the late reconstruction of the outer wall, does not necessarily apply to the
colonnade in its final form.
</note>   Behind them, protected by the roof, was the maenianum summum in ligneis, which contained wooden seats for women. These seats were approached from above by a vaulted corridor, lighted by the windows between the pilasters (p. 8) as has been supposed by Hulsen (<bibl>Mitt. 1897, 334</bibl>, 335). On the roof was
  
<pb n="10"/>
standing room for the pullati, or poorest classes of the population.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> According to the restorations of Taylor and Cresy (Text fig. 1) and of Canina, which
are adopted by Von Gerkan (<bibl>Mitt. 1925, 18</bibl>), there was a covered portico at the top, the
roof of which reached to the summit of the outer wall. Durm's objections to Hulsen's
restoration (Text fig. 2) (669 sqq)-that the spectators on the roof would have been
exposed to the weather and unable to see-are thus both met.
</note> The modern terrace is lower than this roof was, and about at the level of the floor of the corridor behind the wooden seats. Of the four principal entrances, those at the north and south ends of the minor axis were for the imperial family, and the arches here were wider and more highly ornamented than the rest.   For the stucco decoration see LR   381; Weege ap. Hoffmann (Vatik. Palast.) col. 145; Egger, Cod. Escurial 43, pp. 115-116; Heemskerck, ii. 58; <bibl>WS 1902, 437-440</bibl>; id. Festheft fur Bormann (xxiv. 2. 205); Rev. <bibl>Arch. 1917, 2</bibl>. 228; Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. iv. 41-43</bibl>). The entrance on the north seems to have been connected with the Esquiline by a porticus. A wide passage led directly from this entrance to the imperial box (pulvinar, cf. Suet. Nero 12) on the podium. A corresponding box on the opposite side of the podium was probably reserved for the praefectus urbi. The entrances at the ends of the major axis led directly into the arena.
 </p>
<p> The floor of the arena, which must have been of wood, rested on lofty substructures, consisting of walls, some of which follow the curve of the building, while others are parallel to the major axis. They stand on a brick pavement and are from 5.50 to 6.08 metres high. These substructures are entered by subterranean passages, on the lines of the major and minor axes. Another such passage, resembling a cryptoporticus, starts from a raised substructure, projecting a little beyond the line of the podium, not far to the east of the state entrance on the south side, and leads to the  buildings of Claudius on the Caelian, and is usually ascribed to Commodus.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Lugli assigns it to Domitian (Mem. Am. Acad. cit.).
</note> In the substructures are traces of dens for wild beasts, elevators, and mechanical appliances of various sorts, and provision was made for the drainage of the water which flows so abundantly into this hollow and which was carried off in a sewer connecting with that running under the via S. Gregorio (Narducci, Fognatura della Citta di Roma 65-70 and pl. 14; see Ill. 5). The masonry of the substructures dates from the <dateRange from="1" to="499">first century to the end of the fifth&gt;/date&gt;.</dateRange></p>
<p>The statement in the Regionary Catalogue (<rs key="regio3" type="region">Reg. III</rs>), that the amphitheatre had 87,000 loca, cannot refer to persons but pedes, and even so, it is probably incorrect, for the total seating capacity cannot have exceeded forty-five thousand (<bibl>BC 1894, 312-324</bibl>), with standing room on the roof for about five thousand more.</p>
<p>Nine published fragments of the Marble Plan (FUR 55, 69, 13 a-g) represent parts of the amphitheatre, and there are a few others of little importance and uncertain position (HJ 294-296).

Cal. 21) and completed in <date value="52">52 A.D.</date> by Claudius, who dedicated them both on 1st August. The cost of the two was 350,000,000 sesterces, or £3,500,000 sterling (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 122</bibl>; Frontinus, de aquis, i. 4, 13, 15, 18-2 ; <bibl>ii. 68</bibl>, 72, 73, 86, 90, 91, 93, 104, 15 ; Suet. Claud. 20;

<bibl>CIL vi. 1256</bibl>; <bibl>ix. 4051</bibl>). Originally the water was taken from the river Anio at the forty-second mile of the via Sublacensis; but, as the water was apt to be turbid, Trajan made use of the two uppermost of the three lakes formed by Nero for the adornment of his villa at Subiaco-the Simbruina stagna of Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiv. 22</bibl> (<bibl>NS 1883, 19</bibl>; <bibl>1884, 425</bibl>; Giovannoni, Monas teri di <bibl>Subiaco i. 273</bibl> sqq.), thus lengthening the aqueduct to 58 miles 700 paces. The length of 62 miles given to the original aqueduct in the inscription of Claudius on the PORTA MAIOR (q.v.) must be an error for 52; for an unsuccessful attempt to explain it otherwise see <bibl>Mel. 1906, 311-318</bibl>. We have a record of repairs to it in an inscription of <date value="381">381 A.D.</date>, but it is uncertain what part of it is meant (<bibl>CIL vi. 3865</bibl> = 31945). Its volume at the intake was 4,738 quinariae, or 196,627 cubic metres in 24 hours. Its course outside the city cannot be described here (see references below).</p>
<p> From its piscina (or filtering tank) near the seventh milestone of the via Latina it was carried on the lofty arches of the aqua Claudia, in a channel immediately superposed on the latter; and it was the highest in level of all the aqueducts that came into the city.</p>
<p> These arches ended behind the <ref target="horti-pallantiani" n="U">HORTI PALLANTIANI</ref> (q.v.), the former Vigna Belardi, where the terminal piscina of these two aqueducts was situated (LF 24; cf. <bibl>BC 1912, 163</bibl>, 228-235; <bibl>NS 1912, 195</bibl>; <bibl>1913, 6-8</bibl>).</p>
<p> Like the Claudia, the Anio Novus supplied the highest parts of the city. Before the reforms introduced by Frontinus, it was freely used to supply the deficiencies (largely due to dishonesty) of other aqueducts, and, being turbid, rendered them   impure. The removal of its defects, however, is said to have rendered it equal to the Marcia (ib. ii. 93).

L. Papirius Cursor, as he is wrongly called in Frontinus) and that he died during his

level. But the cippi of Augustus seem to make the length even greater (8 kilometres against 63.7), and the line may have been shortened in Frontinus' day (i. 18). It was repaired by Q. Marcius Rex (see <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref>), by Agrippa in <date value="-33">33 B.C.</date>, and by Augustus in <dateRange from="-11" to="-4">11-4</dateRange> B.C. It acquired the name of Vetus when the Anio Novus was built. Frontinus found the amount of water at the intake to be 4398 quinariae, or 182,517 cubic metres in 24 hours.</p>
<p>We have several cippi of Augustus, some of which, together with a long stretch of its channel going northwards from the porta Esquilina, have been found within the city (LF 17, 23, 32); the reckoning, as usual, beginning from Rome (<bibl>CIL vi. 1243</bibl>; cf. 31558; <bibl>xiv. 4079</bibl>, 4080, 4083,

<p>The original subterranean channel has been found and destroyed just
inside the Porta Maggiore; the intrados was at 46.15 m. above sea-level,
(<bibl>BC 1912, 228-232</bibl>; <bibl>NS. 1913, 7</bibl>, 441). Less than two miles from the
city, a part of it was turned into the specus Octavianus (<bibl>PBS iv. 15</bibl>),
which reached the district of the <ref target="nova-via" n="U">VIA NOVA</ref> (q.v.) near the <ref target="horti-asiniani" n="U">HORTI ASINIANI</ref>
q.v.) (Frontinus, i. 21). The channel is believed to have been identified
at various points; but the site of the via Nova is unfortunately quite
uncertain. Lanciani believes that it crossed the via Appia by the real (not
the so-called) Arch of Drusus, near the vicus Drusianus (see <ref target="aqua-drusia" n="U">AQUA DRUSIA</ref>).</p>
<p>As a result of Frontinus' reforms the turbid water of the Anio Vetus

The columns are of cipollino, 17 metres high and 1.45 in diameter at the base, with Corinthian capitals of white marble, and support an entablature of white marble which probably encircled the whole building. The existing remains consist of portions of the cella wall of peperino, built into the walls of the church, extending for 20 metres on the north-west and 15 on the south-east side; the columns of the pronaos, which stand free from the church with the exception of the two nearest the antae; the architrave and frieze of the facade and sides as far as the cella wall extends, but only a small part of the cornice; and the wide flight of steps leading down to the Sacra via, in the middle of which are the remains of an altar. Some fragments of a colossal male and female statue, and a few other pieces of sculpture, have been found. The whole temple was covered with slabs of marble, which have disappeared.

<p>(delubrum, Pliny bis, templum, id. bis): the first temple of Apollo in Rome, in the campus Martius, vowed in <date value="-433">433 B.C.</date> because of a plague that had raged in the city (<bibl>Liv. iv. 25</bibl>. 3), and dedicated in <date value="-431">431</date> by the consul Cn. Julius (<bibl>Liv. iv. 29</bibl>. 7). It was in or close to an earlier cult centre of the god, the APOLLINAR (q.v.), either a grove or altar. This was the only temple of Apollo in Rome until Augustus built that on the Palatine (Asc. in Cic. orat. in tog. cand. 90-91), and being a foreign cult
was outside the pomerium (extra urbem, <bibl>Liv. xxxiv. 43</bibl>. 2; <bibl>xxxvii. 58</bibl>. 3).
Therefore it was a regular place for extra-pomerial meetings of the senate
(Liv. locc. citt.; <bibl>xxxix. 4</bibl>. I; <bibl>xli. 17</bibl>. 4; Cic. ad Q. fr. ii. 3. 3; ad fam.
viii. 4. 4, 8. 5, 6; ad <bibl>Att. xv. 3</bibl>. I; cf. <bibl>Lucan iii. 103</bibl>: Phoebeia palatia

<p> The site is variously described as <foreign xml:lang="la">extra portam   Carmentalem   inter forum holitorium et circum Flaminium (Asc. loc. cit.), in pratis Flaminiis</foreign>(<bibl>Liv. iii. 63</bibl>. 7), near the forum(Plut.

These indications point definitely to a site just north of the theatre of Marcellus and east of the porticus Octaviae, on the street that led through the porta Carmentalis to the campus Martius, a little south of the present Piazza Campitelli.
&lt;/</p>
<p>Twice Pliny (<bibl>NH xiii. 53</bibl>; <bibl>xxxvi. 28</bibl>) speaks of works of art in the temple of Apollo Sosianus, and this epithet is usually explained as referring to a restoration of this temple, carried out by a Sosius, probably C. Sosius, consul in <date value="-32">32 B.C.</date> and governor of Syria (<bibl>Prosop. iii. 253</bibl>. 556; but cf. <bibl>JRS 1916, 183</bibl>). Livy's statement (vii. 20. 9: <foreign xml:lang="la">relicum anni (<date value="-353">353 B.C.</date>) muris turribusque reficiendis consumptum et aedes Apollinis dedicata est</foreign>) may refer to an earlier restoration, as the direct evidence of Asconius precludes the possibility of any second temple. This temple was also known as that of Apollo Medicus, and in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> the censors let the contract for building a porticus from it to the Tiber, behind the temple of Spes (<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>. 6:<foreign xml:lang="la"> locavit ... porticum aliam post navalia et ad fanum Herculis et post Spei [a] Tiberi [ad] aedem Apollinis Medici</foreign>. The MSS. read <foreign xml:lang="la">et post Spei ad Tiberim aedem Apollinis Medici</foreign>, which Frank prefers-see below). In Greek it appears as <foreign xml:lang="greek">*)apollw/nion</foreign> (Cass. Dio frg. 50. I). The shedding of tears for three days by the statue of Apollo, undoubtedly that in this temple, is cited among the prodigia at the death of the Younger Scipio (Cass. Dio frg. 84. 2).</p>
<p>In this temple were some famous works of art, brought probably for the most part to Rome by C. Sosius-paintings by Aristides of Thebes(Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 99</bibl>), several statues by Philiscus of Rhodes (ib. xxxvi. 34), an Apollo citharoedus by Timarchides (ib. 35), a statue of Apollo of cedar wood from Seleucia (ib. xiii. 53), and the celebrated group of the Niobids

(ib. xxxvi. 28), which even the ancients were doubtful whether they should ascribe to Scopas or Praxiteles (<bibl>Roscher iii. 409-421</bibl>)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> They are quite certainly due to neither. For other paintings, cf. Urlichs, Malerei vor

</note>. The day of dedication of the temple in the Augustan period was 23rd September (Fast. Urb. Arv. ad ix kal. Oct.; CIL I 2. p. 215, 252, 339).   Below the cloisters of S. Maria in Campitelli are remains of its podium wall, 13 metres long, over 4 high and over 2 thick. Delbruck assumed without question that it was a part of the original structure; but Frank, while admitting that the core, of blocks of cappellaccio tufa, may belong to it, maintains, owing to the use in the facing of tufa from Monte Verde (the southern end of the Janiculum) that the rest belongs to the restoration of <date value="179">179 A.D.</date> (<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>. 6, which he refers to the temple itself), except some concrete with facing of opus reticulatum, attributable to the restoration of Sosius (Delbruck, Apollotempel, Rome, 1903; HJ 535-538; Wissowa, Rel. 294; Arch. f. <bibl>Religionsw. 1909, 74-75</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1893, 46-60</bibl>; Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1878, 218</bibl>; Mem.

Before the entrance to the temple stood a marble statue  of the god, and an altar surrounded by four oxen by Myron (id. ib. 5-8) In the cella was a statue of Apollo by Scopas (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 25</bibl>), one of Diana by Timotheus (ib. 32), and of Latona by Cephisodotus (ib. 24).

<p>    refers to these statues in the cella (see HJ 68 n. 73), or to the relief in the pediment (see Rothstein's ed. ad'loc.).   Golden gifts were deposited in the temple by Augustus (Mon. <bibl>Anc. xxiv. 54</bibl>) and it contained a collection of seal rings and jewels (dactyliotheca) dedicated by Marcellus (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvii.11</bibl>   ), hanging lamps (ib. xxxiv. 14), and a statue of Apollo Comaeus, brought to Rome in the time of Verus (<bibl>Amm. xxiii. 6</bibl>. 24). </p>
<p>For a possible representation of the statue of Apollo Actius, see <ref target="arcus-constantini" n="U">ARCUS CONSTANTINI</ref> (p. 37).</p>
<p> The temple was connected with, and perhaps surrounded by, a porticus Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 1</bibl>; <bibl>Vell. ii. 81</bibl>; Suet. Aug. 29; Cass. Dio liii. I. 3) with columns of giallo antico (<bibl>Prop. ii. 31</bibl>. 3), between which were statues of the fifty daughters of Danaus and before them equestrian statues of their unfortunate husbands, the sons of Aegyptus (<bibl>Prop. ii. 31</bibl>. 4; Schol. <bibl>Pers.
ii. 56</bibl>; Ov. Trist. iii. I. 61-62). It is possible that the <ref target="arcus-octavii" n="U">ARCUS OCTAVII</ref> (q.v.)
formed the entrance to this porticus. Adjoining, or perhaps forming a
part of the porticus, was a library, bibliotheca Apollinis, consisting of two
sections, one for Greek and one for Latin books (CILvi. 5188, 5189, 5884),
with medallion portraits of famous writers on the walls, and large enough
for meetings of the senate (Cass. Dio liii. I. 3 ; Suet. Aug. 29 ; Ov. Trist.
iii. I. 63 ; Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 37</bibl>). The space enclosed within the porticus was
the area Apollinis (<bibl>Solin. i. 18</bibl>; FUR frgs. I, 418, 421), or area aedis
Apollinis (<bibl>CIL vi. 32327</bibl>, 23, ludi saec. a. 203).</p>
<p>The Sibylline books were brought here from the temple of Jupiter on
the Capitol and placed beneath the pedestal of the statue of Apollo
(Suet. Aug. 29; Verg. <bibl>Aen. vi. 72</bibl> and Serv. ad loc.; <bibl>Tib. ii. 5</bibl>. 17), and
they were saved when the temple itself was burned (see below). Part of the ceremony of the ludi saeculares took place at this temple (CIL vi.

<p> The facade of the original temple was Ionic, if Richmond cit. is right; while it was restored in the Corinthian order by Domitian, if a relief in the Uffizi is correctly interpreted (<bibl>PBS iii. 241</bibl> sqq.; <bibl>JRS iv. 217-218</bibl>).</p>
<p> The site of the temple has been much discussed. Three main theories have been brought forward, according to which it should be placed (a) in the garden of the Villa Mills; (b) in the area of the so-called Vigna Barberini, the centre of which is occupied by the old church of S. Maria in Pallara or S. Sebastiano (for the Regio Palladii or Pallaria see <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>,p. 165); (c) to the south of the <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTI</ref> (q.v.), facing over the circus Maximus, being identified with what is generally known as the temple of <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">JUPITER VICTOR</ref> or <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">PROPUGNATOR</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>(a) The first theory may be dismissed briefly. The further study of the fragments of the forma Urbis and the progress of the excavations have shown that there cannot possibly have been room for the temple and area of Apollo in the garden to the north-east of the actual Villa Mills (see <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>).</p>
<p> (b) The second theory, which is that of Hulsen, is apparently more in accordance with some of the literary testimony (esp. Ov. Trist. iii. I. 27 sqq.) than the third (see <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">AREA PALATINA</ref>, <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTI</ref>, <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">ROMA QUADRATA</ref>). At present we do not know what this area contains; and all that is to be seen belongs to the time of Domitian (see <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>, p. 165). The temple was burnt down in 363, it is true; but it is only to be expected that some remains of it exist; and the question could be settled by a few days' excavation.</p>
<p>(c) The third theory is on the whole the most satisfactory. What remains of the temple is a podium of concrete of the Augustan period,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It was originally enclosed by walls of hewn stone which carried the columns and the
walls of the cella.
</note> with a long flight of steps, facing south-west. This has been recently cleared, but no report has been published. On the south-east part of it is built over the mosaic pavements of a room   and the cement floor of an open tank of a house of a very slightly earlier period (perhaps the domus Palatina, a part of which was destroyed for the erection of the temple). A hypocaust on the south-west, five tiles of which bear the stamp <bibl>CIL xv. 145</bibl>. 1 belonging to another (?) house in front of the
<pb n="19"/>
temple, has been demolished to give place to the steps, and vaulted substructions of this house may be seen below on the face of the hill. It is very difficult to think of any other temple but that of Apollo for the erection of which such a house would have been demolished (JRS 1914   201-208).   See Parker, Historical Photographs, 2794. It is, too, certainly a strong argument for the contiguity of the temple of Apollo and the house of Hortensius that the temple site was apparently brought for an extension of this house (<foreign xml:lang="la">contractas emptionibus complures domus per procuratores, quo laxior fieret ipsius, publicis se usibus destinare professus est; templumque Apollini et circa porticus facturum promisit, quod ab eo singulari exstructum munificentia est,</foreign> Vell. <bibl>Pat. ii. 81</bibl>). </p>
<p>Another point is the rough identification of both in the Augustan age with the site of Romulus' hut and Evander's citadel, both of which stood on the south-west side of the hill (<bibl>Prop. iv. 1</bibl>. 1; Verg. <bibl>Aen. viii. 98</bibl> sqq.).</p>
<p> It seems, too, that the Carmen Saeculare, sung from the steps of the temple, would have far more point were the temple of Diana visible on the Aventine opposite, with those of Fides on the Capitol, and of Honos and Virtus near the porta Capena (both of which are named in it) also within view (<bibl>YW   1910, 15</bibl> ; <bibl>CQ 1910, 145</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Hulsen points out, however, that the Carmen was sung after a sacrifice in the temple to Apollo and Diana (cf. p. 17 n. 1) and was repeated on the Capitol (<bibl>CIL vi. 32323</bibl>,
  l. 139 sqq.). See also Dennison in Univ. of Michigan Studies, i. 49-66.
</note></p>
<p> On the other hand, the passages in regard to <ref target="roma-quadrata-2" n="U">ROMA QUADRATA</ref>, etc. (q.v.) are certainly much more difficult to interpret. There is little room for the area Palatina in front of the temple; and the attempt to make it face north-east will not hold with the remains themselves. Remains of a part of the portico may be identified under the Flavian domus Augustiana: while the libraries, if correctly identified with the two apsidal halls to the south-west of the triclinium   of that house, must have been entirely reconstructed by Domitian.</p>

It was 22,172 paces long, of which 358 were on arches. Its supply was only 392 quinariae, all of which was used outside the city. The quality of the water was indeed so bad that it was probably intended mainly for the <ref target="naumachia-augusti" n="U">NAUMACHIA AUGUSTI</ref> (q.v.), behind which it ended, the surplus being used for gardens and irrigation, except when the bridges were under repair, and it was the only supply available for the Transtiberine region.

6380 paces long, and a piece of its channel (?) is described in <bibl>BC 1912,

After being in use for only ten years, the supply failed, and was interrupted for nine years, until Vespasian restored it in 71; and ten years later Titus had to repair it once more, <foreign xml:lang="la">aquas Curtiam et Caeruleam ... cum a capite aquarum a solo vetustate (!) dilapsae essent nova forma reducendas sua impensa curavit</foreign>. On 3rd July, <date value="88">88</date>, a tunnel under the mons Aeflanus, near Tibur, was completed. We have no records of other restorations, except from the study of the remains themselves, which show that a good deal of repairing was done in the second and third centuries (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 122</bibl>; Frontinus, de aquis i. 4, 13-15, 18-20, iii. 69, 72, 76, 86, 87, 89, 91, 104, 105; Suet.

<p> Its main springs, the Caeruleus and Curtius, were situated 300 paces to the left of the thirty-eighth milestone of the via Sublacensis, and thus only 100 paces from those of the <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p> The length of its channel is given in the inscription on the porta Maior as 45 miles, while Frontinus gives it as 1 mile 406 paces more, which is probably to be accounted for by his measuring up as far as the fons Albudinus, which was added between the time of Claudius and his own. The fons Augustae (see <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref>) was also turned into the aqua Claudia when the Marcia was full; but sometimes even the Claudia could not carry it, and it ran to waste (<bibl>Frontinus ii. 72</bibl>). Pliny's figure (40 miles) is only approximate. Its springs are slightly further up the Anio valley than those of the Marcia, but belong to the same group. Its volume at the springs was 4607 quinariae, or 191,190 cubic metres in 24 hours. Its course outside the city cannot be dealt with here. Directly after

its piscina, near the seventh mile of the via Latina, it finally emerged on to
arches, which increase in height as the ground falls towards the city;
they carried also the channel of the <ref target="anio-novus" n="U">ANIO NOVUS</ref> (q.v.), the highest of all
the aqueducts, and both channels still pass over the via Labicana and via
Praenestina by a great monumental arch, which later became the <ref target="porta-maior" n="U">PORTA MAIOR</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>From the porta Maior the <ref target="arcus-caelimontani" n="U">ARCUS CAELIMONTANI</ref> (q.v.) diverged to
the left and conveyed a portion of its supply across the Caelian to the

and the Transtiberine region (Frontinus, i. 20).
That this branch also supplied the first region is clear from <bibl>CIL vi. 3866</bibl>
=31963, which mentions a castellum situated in it. The main aqueduct
ran on to the terminal piscina <foreign xml:lang="la">post hortos Pallantianos</foreign>

supplied the higher parts of the city, the Esquiline, Viminal and Quirinal,
which, as Pliny says, its height enabled it to do. See references under

<p>The springs of the aqua Iulia are situated about half a mile above the

abbey of Grottaferrata. Frontinus says that they were 2 miles to the
right of the twelfth mile of the via Latina, but this is too far. The length
is given as 15,4261 paces. The supply was 1206 quinariae, or 50,043
cubic metres in 24 hours. (162 quinariae more were received from  the
Claudia; and 190 given to the Tepula.) Several cippi are known, all of
the time of Augustus.</p>
<p>No. 302 has been found near the springs and 281 not far below the
abbey; while others (157, 156, 154, 153) have come to light at Capannelle
near the seventh mile of the via Latina, before the channel begins to run
above ground upon the arches of the Marcia (<bibl>CIL vi. 31563</bibl> b=xiv. 4278;

<p>The whole of this group belongs to the restoration of <dateRange from="-11" to="-4">11-4</dateRange> B.C. But
another cippus has been found, also above the abbey, bearing the number
2. It dates from <date value="14">14 A.D.</date>, and must belong to another restoration by
Augustus, of which we have no other record (<bibl>NS 1893, 240</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi.
31563</bibl> c; EE ix 970).</p>
<p>From the point of its emergence the aqua Iulia runs, above the aqua
Tepula, upon the arches of the <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref> (q.v.), and the main channel
goes to its terminal castellum. But a branch ran to the <ref target="nymphaeum-alexandri" n="U">NYMPHAEUM

Guglielmo Pepe (called Forma Claudiana in Eins. 5. 3; 6. 2; cf. Mon.
<bibl>L. i. 479</bibl>; DAP 2. ix. 403).</p>
<p>Frontinus tells us that before the construction of the aqua Claudia,
the Marcia and Iulia supplied the Caelian and the Aventine (ii. 76, 87); in
his own time a part of the Marcia was diverted at Spes Vetus and delivered
to the reservoirs of the former hill. See Jord. i. I. 466; LA 295-310 ;

<p>The water from the springs of the aqua Iulia (not the aqua Crabra:
Frontinus, i. 9) is now brought into Rome by the channel called the
Marrana Mariana <bibl>(constructed by Calixtus II in 1122)</bibl>, but was always
used mainly for mills and for irrigation (<bibl>LPD ii. 379</bibl>; LA 325-327).</p>

</note> and 816 (<bibl>NS 1892,
152</bibl>-<bibl>EE ix. 966</bibl>)) have been found, including the 1215th from  Rome,
which stood only about 3.5 kilometres from the springs, and about 86.6
from Rome. This corresponds fairly closely with Frontinus' measurement
of 61,7101 paces (91.4 kilometres) : whereas the distance from the springs
by road was 38 miles along the via Sublacensis, from which they lay 200
paces to the left, or 3 miles to the right of the thirty-sixth milestone of the
via Valeria (Plin. and Strabo loc. cit. are in error). Augustus also added
another spring, the aqua Augusta, which lay 800 paces further up (see
<ref target="aqua-claudia" n="U">AQUA CLAUDIA</ref>), which doubled the volume of the aqueduct (Mon. <bibl>Anc.
iv. 11</bibl>, 12). The supply at the springs was 4690 quinariae, or 194,635 cubic
metres in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The same group of springs are still in use for the modern water supply
of Rome, and are now, as then, famous for coldness and purity; though,
owing to the fact that the floor of the Anio valley has risen since Roman
times, it is impossible to identify them exactly.</p>
<p>Nero outraged public opinion by bathing in its springs: but the
aqueduct itself seems to have yielded but little to the city in his day,
owing to the depredations of private persons (Frontinus cit.; Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxi. 42</bibl>), and a further restoration was carried out by Titus in <date value="79">79 A.D.</date>
(<bibl>CIL vi. 1246</bibl>): there is evidence of repairs by Hadrian; and others were
probably made by Septimius Severus in <date value="196">196 A.D.</date> (<bibl>CIL vi. 1247</bibl>); while
in <dateRange from="212" to="213">212-3</dateRange> Caracalla cleared the springs, made some new tunnels, and added
another spring, the fons Antoninianus, in connection no doubt with
the construction of the branch to his thermae <bibl>(ib. 1245)</bibl>.</p>
<p>The aqua Marcia was joined by the <ref target="aqua-tepula" n="U">AQUA TEPULA</ref> (q.v.) and the
<ref target="aqua-iulia" n="U">AQUA IULIA</ref> (q.v.) before the point where it emerged from its underground
course, near the sixth mile of the via Latina; and their channels were
carried above it on the same arches, and are to be seen in section in the
Aurelian wall, just to the right of the <ref target="porta-maior" n="U">PORTA MAIOR</ref> (q.v.). From this
point they have been made use of by it as far as the <ref target="porta-tiburtina" n="U">PORTA TIBURTINA</ref> (q.v.),
soon after which they begin to run underground once more, and reach
their terminal castellum just inside the porta Collina, at the north angle
of the thermae Diocletiani.</p>
<p>For all this stretch there were cippi of Augustus bearing the names of
the three aqueducts (<bibl>CIL vi. 1249</bibl>=3156 ; add No. 71, <bibl>BC 1905, 289</bibl>;
<bibl>CR 1905, 330</bibl>, and No. 82, <bibl>BC 1899, 39</bibl>).</p>
<p>The regions served by the main channel of the aqua Marcia were in the
<pb n="26"/>
                           
neighbourhood of the castellum; numerous lead pipes were also found
near the porta Viminalis, which served for its distribution (LF 10, 17, 24,
etc.). It also ran to the Quirinal (<bibl>Mart. ix. 18</bibl>. 6; see <ref target="m-valerius-martialis-domus" n="U">DOMUS MARTIALIS</ref>).</p>
<p>The water was brought to the Capitol by Marcius himself in 140, <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Liv. Epit. Oxyrhync. 188-190:<foreign xml:lang="la"> aqua Anio aqua [Marcia in Capi]tolium contra Sibyllae

did not cross the depression between the Capitol and the Quirinal (see <ref target="forum-traiani" n="U">FORUM TRAIANI</ref>,
p. 238) on arches, or something would have been said (or found) of them.

<p>Hulsen attributes a cippus of Augustus, found near the Lateran, bearing
the name Marcia and the number 3 (<bibl>CIL vi. 31560</bibl>) to this aqueduct:
but there is another hypothesis admissible in regard to it. Before the construction of the aqua Claudia, so Frontinus tells us (ii. 76), the Caelian and
Aventine were supplied by the Marcia and Iulia; and it is quite possible
that the cippus, and both the <ref target="arcus-dolabellae-et-silani" n="U">ARCUS DOLABELLAE ET SILANI</ref> (q.v.)
and the <ref target="arcus-lentuli-et-crispini" n="U">ARCUS LENTULI ET CRISPINI</ref> (q.v.) (<bibl>CIL vi. 1384</bibl>, 1.385 ; cf. p. 3125)

by Caracalla to supply his thermae (q.v.). It crossed the via Appia by
the so-called <ref target="arcus-drusi-1" n="U">ARCO DI DRUSO</ref> (q.v.) and thence led to the great reservoir

The springs were situated at the eighth mile of the via Collatina, i.e.
two miles to the left of the eighth mile of the via Praenestina, in agro
Lucullano (<bibl>PBS i. 139</bibl>, 143), and produced 2504 quinariae or 103,916
cubic metres in 24 hours. The subterranean course was 12,865 paces long,
and 540 paces were carried on substructions. A girl is said to have shown
the springs to some soldiers, hence the name; the incident was recorded
by a painting in a chapel near the springs (<bibl>Frontinus i. 10</bibl>). It was the
lowest of all the aqueducts except the Appia and the Alsietina.</p>

in the Villa Medici. From this point it ran southward along the side of the

on arches for 700 paces. The arch in the modern via del Nazzareno, by
which the aqueduct was carried over a branch street from the via Lata

 </note> and here was its terminal castellum (LA 444). Like
the Marcia, its supply was largely diverted to private uses in the time
of Nero (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxi. 41</bibl>). A restoration by Constantine is recorded
in an inscription found in the Via Nazionale, obviously nowhere near its
original position (<bibl>CIL vi. 31564</bibl>). </p>
<p>The forma Virginis is frequently mentioned in documents of the eighth
to tenth centuries (cf. Eins. 2. 5; 4. 4; Mon. <bibl>L. i. 455-456</bibl>, 467).
It was repaired by Hadrian I (<bibl>LPD i. 505</bibl>); cf. also a bull of 955, which
speaks of the arcus Claudii (1) as arcora (<bibl>Kehr i. 63</bibl>, 6; <bibl>ASRSP 1899, 268</bibl>).
In 1453 Nicholas V restored it, and brought the water as far as the Trevi
fountain, where its present termination is in the fine fountain of Niccolo
Salvi <bibl>(1744)</bibl>. It was repaired by Sixtus IV, but in 1570 it was thoroughly
rebuilt by Pius V. His successors, and especially Gregory XIII, built
many fountains which were supplied by it. Its low level rendered it
impossible for it to supply any part of the higher quarters of Rome. See

paved with travertine on the south side of the Alta Semita, opposite the
temple of Quirinus, under the Ministero della Casa Reale, close to the

to the higher level of the street have been traced for a distance of 35 metres

<p> This altar stood on the west side of the via Flaminia and some distance
north of the buildings of Agrippa, on the site of the present Palazzo Peretti
Fiano-Almagia at the corner of the Corso and the Via in Lucina.
Fragments of the decorative sculpture, found in 1568, are in the Villa
Medici, the Vatican, the Uffizi, and the Louvre; others, found in 1859,
are in the Museo delle Terme and in Vienna. They were recognised as
parts of the same monument by Von Duhn and published in 1881 (Ann.
d. <bibl>Inst. 1881, 302-329</bibl>; Mon. d. Inst. xi. pls. 34-36; for a fragment found
in 1899 cf. <bibl>NS 1899, 50</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1899, 234</bibl>). Systematic excavations in 1903
under the palazzo (<bibl>NS 1903, 549-574</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1904, 331</bibl>) brought to light
other remains of the monument, both architectural and decorative. The
work was not finished, but carried far enough to permit of a reconstruction
which is fairly accurate in its main features, although there are still
unsolved problems in connection with the arrangement and interpretation
of the reliefs. Most of the fragments then found are in the Museo delle
Terme (PT 65-68), though others still remain on the site.</p>
<p> The altar itself was not found. It stood within an enclosing wall of
white marble, about 6 metres high, which formed a rectangle measuring
11.625 metres east and west, and 10.55 north and south (<bibl>NS 1903, 568</bibl>).
In the middle of the east and west sides were entrances flanked with
pilasters, and other pilasters stood at each angle of the enclosure. The
inside of the enclosing wall was decorated with a frieze of garlands and ox-
skulls above a maeander pattern, beneath which was a panelling of fluted
marble. A frieze of flowers and palmettes adorned the outside of the
enclosure, and above this, on the north side, were reliefs representing the
procession in honour of the goddess, with many figures of the imperial
family and the flamines, and, on the south, senators, magistrates and
others (Reinach, Repertoire des <bibl>Reliefs i. 232-237</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> 236. 4 is still on the spot.
</note>  On the north side of
the east entrance was a group of Honos, Pax and Roma, while on the south
was a relief of Tellus, or Italia (Van Buren, <bibl>JRS 1913, 134-141</bibl>). The
west entrance was flanked on the north by a group of Mars and Faustulus
at the Ficus Ruminalis (?) and on the south by Aeneas sacrificing when
he found the sow. An ingenious attempt has been made to explain the
architectural and decorative scheme of the enclosure as a reproduction in
marble of the temporary wooden enclosure of the site and the ceremony

of consecration on 4th July, B.C. <date value="-13">13</date> (Pasqui, <bibl>SR 1913, 283-304</bibl>). The

to the arch on the via Appia just inside the Porta S. Sebastiano, perhaps
the arcus Recordationis of the Einsiedeln Itinerary (11. 3; 13. 24), but
see <ref target="arcus-drusi-1" n="U">ARCUS DRUSI</ref>. Only the central part of this arch is now standing, but
it was originally triple, or at least with projections on each side, and of
somewhat elaborate construction, although never finished. It is built
of travertine, which was faced with marble, and on each side of the archway
are unfluted columns of Numidian marble with white marble bases and capitals of the Composite order. The archway is 7.21 metres high, 5.34 wide and
5.61 deep. The aqua Antoniniana, the branch of the <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref> (q.v.)

concrete that is now visible on top of the arch seems to belong to a period
later than that of Caracalla. This arch cannot be identified with that
of Drusus, both because it is so far from the <ref target="vicus-drusianus" n="U">VICUS DRUSIANUS</ref> (q.v.),
and because its construction belongs to a later period, but it may possibly

<p> an arch over the via Lata close to the ara Pacis,
which is often called <ref target="arcus-hadriani" n="U">ARCUS HADRIANI</ref>, because of two reliefs of the
Hadrianic period that adorned it and are now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Helbig Fuhrer , 897, 990; Strong, Sculpture 236-8; SScR
213-215; <bibl>PBS iv. 258-263</bibl>; <bibl>v. 180</bibl>; Cons. Cat. 36, 266). The keystone is
also in the same place (ib. 37). This arch was removed in 1662 by
Alexander VII in order that the Corso might be widened.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> An inscription was set up at the time to mark the spot, and may still be seen on the
north side of the Corso.
 </note> It was known
earlier as the arcus Octaviani (<bibl>PBS iii. 269-271</bibl>), but from the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth
century</dateRange> it was called Arco di Portogallo because it adjoined the residence of
the Portuguese ambassador, the Palazzo Peretti-Fiano. The foundation
of one of the piers has been found beneath the present palace, 2.36 metres
below the level of the Corso. Extant drawings of this arch, dating from
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (HJ 466; <bibl>PBS ii. 35</bibl>, and No. 52;
LR 507), show a single archway flanked on each side with two columns,
and surrounded with a cornice (Ill. 2). The architecture seems to belong to
a period later than that of Hadrian, and it is quite possible that the arch
itself is of considerably later date-being in fact sometimes assigned de-
finitely to Marcus Aurelius-and that it was decorated with sculpture
from earlier monuments, as was the case with the arch of Constantine.
Indeed, Hulsen (DAP 2. xi. 174) believes it to belong to the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth</dateRange> or
<dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange>, and to have been built with fragments of earlier buildings.
One of the sides was demolished in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange>, when a fragment
of the cornice was removed to S. Maria in Trastevere (HJ 465-468; <bibl>BC 1891, 18-23</bibl>; <bibl>1896, 239-246</bibl>; <bibl>1915, 333</bibl>). This is against its having been
a' mediaeval pasticcio ' (Cons. 36). </p>

to take the place of an ordinary column or pedestal as a base for statues
and honorary insignia. In process of time the arch itself became in some
instances more important than what it supported, but this was probably
not originally the case. For discussion of the Roman arch, see Graef in

<p> * two arches erected in honour of Augustus in the forum,
one in <date value="-29">29 B.C.</date>, to commemorate the victory at Actium, the other in <date value="-19">19 B.C.</date>,
on account of the return of the standards captured by the Parthians
at Carrhae (Cass. <bibl>Dio li. 19</bibl>; <bibl>liv. 8</bibl>). It is explicitly stated that the
latter stood <foreign xml:lang="la">iuxta aedem divi Iulii</foreign> (Schol. Veron. Verg. <bibl>Aen. vii. 605</bibl>).
These arches are represented on coins, that of <date value="-29">29 B.C.</date><note anchored="true" place="foot"> 1 Dated <date value="-16">16 B.C.</date> by the B.M. Catalogue.</note> on a denarius
of Vinicius (Babelon, Vinicia 4; Cohen, Aug. 544; BM <bibl>Rep. ii. 50</bibl>, 4477-8
= BM  Aug. 77, 78), and that of <date value="-19">19 B.C.</date> on coins of <dateRange from="-18" to="-17">18-17</dateRange> B.C. (Cohen,
Aug. 82-85; BM Aug. 427-9). The earlier coins represent a triple arch,
surmounted with a quadriga in the centre and barbarians on the sides.
The archways are of equal height, and the middle piers double the width
of the outer. The later coins also represent a triple arch, with quadriga
and figures of barbarians, and piers of the same relative width as the
other, but the central portion is much higher than the sides.</p>
<p>The foundations of one of these arches exist between the temple of
Julius and that of Castor, being laid on the short axis of the former
temple and close to it. They consist of travertine blocks on concrete
beds, and those of three of the four piers are in situ. The middle piers
were 2.95 metres wide, and those of the sides 1.35, corresponding to the
representation on the coins. The depth of the middle piers is also greater
than that of the side piers. The width of the central archway was
4.05 metres and that of those at the side arches 2.55, the breadth of the
whole structure being 17.75 metres. The pavement in the central
passage is still partially preserved, and some of the marble fragments
of the arch have been set in modern brick beds on the travertine foundations, which themselves rest on the pavement of an earlier street.</p>
<p>If the evidence cited above were all we had, we should identify these
ruins with the arch of <date value="-19">19 B.C.</date>, on the strength of the scholiast's <foreign xml:lang="la">iuxta
aedem divi Iulii</foreign>, but an inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 873</bibl>), cut in a block of Parian
marble 2.67 metres long, was found in 1546/7 close to these foundations,
which records a dedication to Augustus in <date value="-29">29 B.C.</date> This inscription
may have belonged to this arch, although it cannot have been the principal
inscription on the attic. No trace of a second arch of Augustus in the
forum has thus far been discovered (see also <ref target="arcus-pietatis" n="U">ARCUS PIETATIS</ref>), and the
identification of the existing ruins is therefore still uncertain (Jahrb. d.
<bibl>Inst. 1889, 151-162</bibl>; Ant. <bibl>Denk. i. 14-15</bibl>, 27-28; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 243</bibl>;

<pb n="35"/></p>
<p>Fiechter and Hulsen (ap. <bibl>Tobelmann i. 13-16</bibl>) attribute to this arch
the Doric fragments found near the Regia in 1872 (see their list, repeated
from Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1889, 235</bibl>). A similar fragment was seen at SS.
Quattro Coronati (<bibl>PBS ii. 104</bibl>-a drawing by the later-seventeenth
century-hand).  It is noted by Hulsen that, though an arch was voted
by the senate in <date value="-29">29 B.C.</date>, it is nowhere stated that it was consecrated.
He attributes all the coins to the same arch, and follows a conjecture of
Dressel's, by which the inscription is inferred from the legends on the
coins of <dateRange from="-18" to="-17">18-17 B.C.</dateRange>: <foreign xml:lang="la">S.P.Q.R. Imp. Caesari Aug. cos. xi. tr. p. vi. civib.

<p> * erected by the senate in honour of Constantine to
commemorate his victory over Maxentius in <date value="312">312 A.D.</date>, as the inscription
in the attic (<bibl>CIL vi. 1139</bibl>) records. The date of its completion is fixed
to <dateRange from="315" to="316">315-316 A.D.</dateRange> by the mention of the decennalia in the inscriptions of
the side arches; and Grossi-Gondi decides for <date value="316">316</date> because the consulship
is omitted, whereas in 315 he held it for the fourth time.  It is not
mentioned by any of our literary sources. It stands at the beginning of
the road which traverses the valley between the Palatine and the Caelian
from the Colosseum to the south-east end of the circus Maximus, and which
is often (though without warrant) called via Triumphalis. The road
did not, however, run through it, and indeed lay at a somewhat lower
level, though not so low as to necessitate steps for foot-passengers to
pass through (<bibl>Mitt. 1891, 92</bibl>). The archways and the space round the
arch are paved with travertine. The arch is built of white marble;- it
is 21 metres high, 25.70 wide, and 7.40 deep; the central archway is
11.50 high and 6.50 wide, and the two lateral arches are 7.40 metres
high and 3.36 wide. Between the archways and at the corners were
eight fluted Corinthian columns of giallo antico, one of which has been
removed to the Lateran, while the other seven still remain: they were
doubtless removed from other buildings. The sculptures with which it
is decorated belong to several different periods (Ill. 5).</p>
<p>(1) The two reliefs at the ends of the arch and the two on the jambs
of the central archway, representing conflicts between Romans and
Dacians, formed part of a continuous frieze, which is supposed to have
decorated the enclosure wall of the <ref target="forum-traiani" n="U">FORUM TRAIANI</ref> (q.v.), and may
belong to the period of Domitian (Neue Jahrbiicher, 1905, 522; SScR
135, 151, n. 17; Rev. Arch. 1924, ii. 365), though Sieveking, in Festschrift
fur P. Arndt 36, returns to the usual ascription to Trajan.
<pb n="37"/></p>
<p>(2) The eight statues of Dacians in pavonazzetto (Phrygian) marble
standing on the cornice in front of the attic, each above one of the giallo
antico columns (all of which bear the inscription Ad Arcum, <bibl>CIL vi.
36617</bibl>), doubtless came from the Forum of Trajan, where similar statues
have been found <bibl>(Braccio Nuovo 9, 127; cf. Chiaramonti, 356; Brit.
Mus. 1770)</bibl>. Of those on the arch, one is a reproduction in white marble
(for the torso  see Cap. Cat. Atrio No. 21) and the rest have restored
heads and hands. Of the original heads in white marble, two are probably
in the Vatican (Braccio Nuovo 118; Busti 329).</p>
<p>(3) The round medallions over the side arches, four on each side,
representing an emperor in sacrificial and hunting scenes alternately,
have been much discussed. They were attributed to the Templum
Gentis Flaviae, or some monument of the Flavian period, and supposed
to have been used over again by Claudius Gothicus (<bibl>PBS iii. 229-251</bibl>).
But most recent critics have recognised Antinous in some of them, and
referred them to the period of Hadrian (<bibl>Mitt. 1907, 345-360</bibl>; <bibl>1911,
214-237</bibl> ; <bibl>1920, 143-151</bibl> ; <bibl>BPW  1911, 1239</bibl>; Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1919, 144</bibl>
sqq.; Mon. <bibl>L. xxix. 177</bibl>; Rev. Arch. 1910, i. 118-131 ; SScR 217-224),
while Hulsen makes those without the nimbus earlier (<bibl>BC 1922, 15</bibl>, n. 5),
attributing them to the period of Hadrian, and the other four (on the
side towards the Colosseum) to that of Philippus Arabus. It is also
suggested that the statue of Apollo represented on them  may be
taken from the Apollo Actius in the temple on the Palatine (SScR 235,
n. 18).</p>
<p>(4) The eight rectangular reliefs in the attic (<bibl>PBS iii. 251-268</bibl>).
Three other reliefs of the same series <note anchored="true" place="foot">Sieveking, however (op. cit. 34), assigns these three to a different (and rather earlier)
arch of the same emperor; cf. also Mon. <bibl>Piot. xvii. (1910) 229-250</bibl>.
 </note> are in the Palazzo dei Conservatori
(Cons. Cat. <bibl>Scala ii. 4</bibl>, 7, 10), and belong to an arch erected in <date value="176">176 A.D.</date>
to commemorate the victories of M. Aurelius in the Sarmatian and
German wars. They depict the emperor entering Rome, engaging in
sacrifice, receiving an address from his soldiers, etc.</p>
<p>To the Constantinian period belong: the reliefs on the pedestals
of the eight columns, representing victories, legionaries and captives,
the low frieze above the side arches and at the ends, the two round
medallions at the ends, representing the setting of the moon and the
rising of the sun (Strong, Sculpture 330, 331; SScR  331-341); the
Victories and river-gods in the spandrels, and the eight portrait busts in
the lateral passages.</p>
<p>The frieze refers to episodes in the life of Constantine-his exploits

Treves, his capture of Susa, his victory over Maxentius, his allocutio
from  the Rostra, and his largitio; and the damage to the heads is attributable to the reaction of Symmachus (Wilpert in <bibl>BC 1922, 13</bibl>, who is

82-95</bibl>; while Wace in <bibl>PBS iv. 270-276</bibl>, attributes it to a monument of
Maxentius).</p>
<p>The legionary signs of the Constantinian period represented on the
arch have been studied by Monaci (DAP 2. ix. 1-23 ; <bibl>xiii. 131</bibl> ; <bibl>xiv. 28</bibl> ;
<bibl>BCr 1907, 55-61</bibl>; Giornale Arcadico, 1906, 590-595, 664-671; <bibl>BC 1925, 82</bibl>).
Frothingham's theory (<bibl>AJA  1912, 3</bibl> sqq., 368 sqq.; <bibl>1913, 487</bibl>;</p>
<p>1915, 1 sqq.; 367 sqq.) that the arch was originally dedicated to
Domitian, and that after his <foreign xml:lang="la">damnatio memoriae</foreign> it was deprived of its
decorations, but stood in ruins till Constantine converted it to his own
uses, has not found general acceptance (Grossi-Gondi, L'Arco di Cos-
tantino, reprinted from Civilta Cattolica, 1st March, 19th April, 1913;
and in DAP 2. xi. 169-172).</p>
<p>Among the many arguments against it are (1) the existence among
the marble blocks used in the interior of the attic of a cornice block not
earlier than the time of Domitian (<bibl>PBS ii. 51</bibl>, No. 105 a; cf. vi. 207 and
YW  1923-4, 106); (2) the fact that the brickwork in the attic is of the
time of Constantine.</p>
<p>We may note the use of polychrome marbles and gilding in the
arch-besides what have been already mentioned, the employment
of porphyry to surround the circular medallions and as a fascia to the
main cornice.</p>
<p>The latest article on the subject <note anchored="true" place="foot">No effective arguments are brought forward to support the contention that the arch
was built before the time of Constantine.
</note> shows that the relief of the Haterii
cannot be used in support of Frothingham's theory.  'If an arch is
represented which stood between the arch of Titus and the Colosseum,
it was single, with eight attached columns.' The whole cornice, too, is
a mass of patchwork, and is crudely imitated in the entablature above
the columns; while the medallions are badly placed (Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad.
iv. (1924) 170-180</bibl>). See also Rossini, Archi Trionfali 67-73; Reinach,

Claudius on the Caelian, a distance of two kilometres. For the greater

Rotondo it divided, and one section ran towards the Aventine, ending
near the church of S. Prisca (LF 35; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 3866</bibl>=31963). The
arches have a span of 7.75 metres and the piers are 2.30 long and 2.10

Palatine was traversed by an aqueduct, perhaps built by Domitian; with
two tiers of arches, which may have carried a syphon. The pipe, 30 cm.
in diameter, which is generally associated with the syphon, would not
have stood the pressure; while if, as at Lyon, small pipes were used, they
might easily have become choked with deposit. Severus reinforced the
arches of Nero (<bibl>CIL vi. 1259</bibl>, where they are called arcus Caelimontani),
including the line of arches across the valley just mentioned (LA 364-374;
<bibl>LS iii. 79</bibl>; <bibl>JRS 1919, 87</bibl>; ZA 147-149).  For a branch which crossed the

<p>The aqueduct is frequently mentioned in the post-classical period.
Forma Claudiana in Eins. 8. 17, clearly refers to it (Forma Latera-
nense, ib. 7. 17; 9. 3; but contrast 2. 6), and it was restored by Hadrian I
(<bibl>LPD i. 504</bibl>). In a document of 978 (Reg. Subl. p. 161) there is a mention
of a <foreign xml:lang="la">domus in qua est oratorium martyrum Cosmae et Damiani quinta
Romae <rs key="regio2" type="region">regione II</rs> iuxta formam Claudia</foreign>; and this oratory, which is
mentioned among the boundaries of S. Erasmo on the Caelian, which lay
to the west of S. Stefano Rotondo (HCh 249), is probably the same as
<foreign xml:lang="la">S. Cosmae et Damiani ubi dicitur asinum frictum</foreign> (Reg. Subl. p. 224).</p>
<p><foreign xml:lang="la">Asinus frictus</foreign> may, like <foreign xml:lang="la">ursus pileatus</foreign>, be the name of an ancient

the neighbourhood of Rome (HCh 239) on the via Ostiensis (<bibl>T. x. 32</bibl>).</p>
<p> The church of S. Nicolas de Formis, near S. Stefano Rotondo, took its
name from this aqueduct (HCh 398), and so did S. Daniel and SS. Sergius

and his sons Geta and Caracalla, at the north-west corner of the forum,
in front of the temple of Concord. This information is contained in the
dedicatory inscription  (<bibl>CIL  vi. 1033</bibl>; cf. 31230) on both sides of
the attic of the arch, which is still standing. The original bronze letters
of this inscription have disappeared, but their matrices remain, and it
can be seen that the name of Geta was chiselled away after his murder,
and the space filled up with additional titles of Severus and Caracalla.
The arch is triple and built of Pentelic marble on a foundation of
travertine, which was concealed by the flight of steps that formed the
approach to the arch from  the forum  side.  Later, probably in the
<dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>, the level in front of the arch on this side was lowered,
the flight of steps lengthened, and the top of the foundation cut away
to provide for them (<bibl>CR 1899, 233</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 21-22</bibl>). The exposed
corners of the foundation were then faced with marble. The arch was
never traversed by a road until mediaeval times.</p>
<p>The arch is 23 metres high, 25 wide and 11.85 deep, the central archway
being 12 metres high and 7 wide, and the side archways 7.80 high and
3 wide. Between the central and side arches are vaulted passages with
coffered ceilings. On each face of the arch are four fluted columns with
Composite capitals, 8.78 metres high and 0.90 metre in diameter at the
base. These columns stand free from the arch on projecting pedestals,
and behind them are corresponding pilasters. An entablature surrounds
the arch, and above it is the lofty attic, 5.60 metres in height, within
which are four chambers.</p>
<p>Over the side arches are narrow bands of reliefs representing the
triumphs of Rome over conquered peoples, and above them four large
reliefs which represent the campaigns of Severus in the East (Reinach,
Rep. d. <bibl>Reliefs i. 258-270</bibl>; Strong, Sculpture 297n300; SScR 303-305).
In the spandrels of the central arch are winged Victories, and in those of
the side arches, river gods. On the keystones of the central arch are
reliefs of Mars Victor, and on the pedestals of the columns, Roman
soldiers driving captives before them. Coins of Severus (Cohen, Sev.
53, 104) and Caracalla (ib. Car. 14, 15) show  that on the top of
the arch was a six- or eight-horse chariot, in which stood Severus
<pb n="44"/>
and Victory, escorted by  Geta and  Caracalla, and  on  the ends
four equestrian figures; but of these statues no traces have been
found.</p>
<p>The excellent preservation of this monument is due in part to the
fact that in the Middle Ages its southern half belonged to the neighbouring
church of SS. Sergio e Bacco, and its northern half was fortified (HC 86).
The erection of this arch destroyed the symmetry of this end of the
forum  (HC 84-90; Thedenat 161-162, 234-238; LR 284-286; Rossini,
Archi trionfali, pls. 50-57; Sangallo, Barb. 31; D'Espouy, Fragments,

Caracalla and Geta, and Caracalla's wife Fulvia Plautilla, the daughter
of Plautianus (<bibl>CIL vi. 1035</bibl> ; cf. 31232). The inscription seems to have
been modified thrice-after the fall of Plautianus in 205, after the murder
of Plautilla in 211, and after the murder of Geta in 212.</p>
<p>The arch is not a true arch, but a flat lintel resting on two piers, and
is entirely of marble, except the base, which is of travertine. It is
6.15 metres in height and the archway is 3.30 metres wide. At the
corners of the piers are pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and the whole
exterior surface is adorned either with coarse decorative sculpture or
reliefs representing sacrificial scenes. On the inside the figures of the
imperial family are carved in relief (those of Plautilla and Geta have
been removed) ; the ceiling is cut in soffits, and the inscription is on the
lintel (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1867, 217</bibl>; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 470; <bibl>PAS ii. 70</bibl>; <bibl>LS iii. 42</bibl>;

at this point by having its curb bent toward the south. The arch was
single, as represented on a relief on the arch of Constantine (HC 74, fig. 28),
and was approached by steps from  the level of the forum.  Various
architectural fragments were discovered in 1835 and 1848, with parts of
the inscription<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The fragments of inscriptions supposed to have belonged to the arch have as a fact

difficult to explain <bibl>(HF 1193)</bibl>. The question has become more important since an attempt

at the time of the accession of Titus. This, however, we have no right to do; for the

his death.
</note> but not finished and dedicated
until after his death (<bibl>CIL vi. 945</bibl>). There is no mention of this arch in 
ancient literature, though it may be alluded to by Martial (de spect. 2)
<pb n="46"/>
quoted s.v. DOMUS AUREA (p. 167). The theory that it was erected
under Nerva and Trajan is improbable (CJ 1915-16, 131-141). In the
Middle Ages it formed part of the stronghold of the Frangipani, a chamber
was constructed in the upper part of the archway, and the level of the
roadway was lowered considerably, exposing the travertine foundations.
The injury to the structure was so great that it was taken down in 1822
and rebuilt by Valadier, who restored a large part of the attic and the
outer half of both piers in travertine. The frieze and inscription are
therefore preserved only on the side towards the Colosseum. The foundations of the arch stand on the pavement of the <ref target="clivus-palatinus" n="U">CLIVUS PALATINUS</ref> (q.v.),
and therefore it has been thought by some that the arch stood originally
farther north and was moved when the temple of Venus and Roma was
built (<bibl>CR 1902, 286</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1905, 118</bibl>; <bibl>BPW  1908, 1034</bibl>; Me1. 1908,
247-248).</p>
<p>It is, however, far more likely that the pavement belongs to the
pre-Neronian period, and that the position of the arch was the only one
possible, given the existence of the vestibule of the domus Aurea. The
arch was constructed of Pentelic marble, and is 13.50 metres wide,
15.40 high, and 4.75 deep. The archway is 8.30 metres high and 5.36
wide. Above it is a simple entablature, and an attic 4.40 metres in
height, on which is the inscription, which is preserved only on the east
side. On each side is an engaged and fluted Corinthian column, standing
on a square pedestal. The capitals of these columns are the earliest
examples of the Composite style. On the inner jambs of the arch are
the two famous reliefs (<bibl>PBS iii. 276-279</bibl>; <bibl>v. 178</bibl>; Strong, cit.), that on
the south representing the spoils from the temple at Jerusalem, the
table of shewbread, the seven-branched candlestick, and the silver
trumpets, which are being carried in triumph into the city; and that
on the north representing Titus standing in a quadriga, the horses of
which are led by Roma, while Victory crowns the emperor with laurel
as he passes through a triumphal arch. In the centre of the ceiling of
the archway, which is finished in soffits (<foreign xml:lang="la">lacunaria</foreign>), is a relief of the
apotheosis of Titus, representing him (or rather his bust) as being carried
up to heaven by an eagle. The frieze <note anchored="true" place="foot"> For a drawing at Windsor (Inv. 8182) which may represent a lost section of this
frieze, see <bibl>AJA 1914, 479-483</bibl>.
 </note> contains a procession of various
personages both civil and military, and of animals being led to sacrifice;
we may recognise a personification of the river god of the Jordan in a
recumbent figure, carried by three men. In the spandrels are the usual
winged Victories; while on the keystones are figures of Roma (or Virtus)
towards the Colosseum, and the Genius populi Romani (or Bonus Eventus <note anchored="true" place="foot">Not Fortuna, because the figure is male.
 </note>
or Honos) towards the Forum. In type the arch is the simplest of those
existing in Rome; the sides of the piers, which are not adorned with
sculpture, were adorned with niches like windows (<bibl>PAS ii. 47-49</bibl>; LR

round the edge of the hill and levelling off the surface enclosed. The
<pb n="48"/>
           
area was therefore in effect a built-up platform, part of which at least
was contemporaneous with the foundations of the temple. It was
enlarged in <date value="-388">388 B.C.</date>, and was regarded as a notable monument even at
the beginning of the empire (<bibl>Liv. vi. 4</bibl>. 11). The extent of the area has
been a matter of dispute, and some scholars have maintained that it
did not extend more than about 15-16 metres from  the sides of the
temple (Richter, Beitrage zur rom. <bibl>Top. ii. 24-25</bibl> ; Hermes, 1883,  115-118;
cf. <bibl>Gilb. iii. 398-399</bibl>; Aust in <bibl>Roscher ii. 709</bibl>), but the prevailing view
at present is that it covered practically all of the Capitolium (Hulsen,
Festschrift fur H. Kiepert 209-222; <bibl>RE iii. 1534-1538</bibl>; Rodocanachi,
Le Capitole romain 25-26). Remains of the walls of the substructures
have been found on the east side which prove that the area extended
in this direction about 35 metres from the temple. On the west it was
probably not more than 30 metres wide, and in front from 40 to 45.
Behind the temple there appears to have been only a narrow space, but
wide enough for the passage of a procession (Plin. <bibl>NH viii. 161</bibl>). Besides
the space occupied by the great temple, the area therefore contained
something more than one hectare of surface, sufficient for the other temples
and monuments that stood <foreign xml:lang="la">in Capitolio</foreign>-an expression ordinarily interpreted as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="la">in area Capitolina</foreign>.</p>
<p>The area was surrounded by a wall, and a porticus built in <date value="-159">159 B.C.</date>
on the inner side of the wall (<bibl>Vell. ii. 1</bibl>. 2, 3. 1). The principal entrance
was in the middle of the south-east side, opposite the front of the great
temple, where the clivus Capitolinus ended, and was sometimes referred
to as fores Capitolii (Suet. Aug. 94; App. <bibl>BC i. 16</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 71</bibl>).
A little south of this entrance, near the corner of the area, was the <ref target="porta-pandana" n="U">PORTA
PANDANA</ref> (q.v.), and there may have been others. The area was closed
at night and protected by dogs (Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 56; <bibl>Dionys. xiii. 7</bibl>;
<bibl>Gell. vi. 1</bibl>. 6), under the charge of a janitor in whose house Domitian
took refuge from the Vitellians. This house was afterwards removed to
make room for the Shrine (q.v.) of <ref target="iuppiter-conservator-sacellum" n="U">IUPPITER CONSERVATOR</ref> (Tac. <bibl>Hist.
iii. 74</bibl>; Suet. Dom. 5; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 479</bibl>=xiv. 32). Sacred geese were
also kept in the area (Dionys. Cic. locc. citt). Beneath the surface of
the area were subterranean passages called favissae, which were entered
from the cella of the great temple, and served as store-rooms for the
old statues that had fallen from its roof, and for various dedicatory gifts
(Fest. 88; <bibl>Gell. ii. 10</bibl>. 2; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 419</bibl>; <bibl>Roscher ii. 710</bibl>).</p>
<p>Within this area were the casa Romuli, the Curia calabra, the aedes
Tensarum, and  the atrium  Publicum; and a considerable number
of temples-of Fides, Iuppiter Feretrius, Iuppiter Custos, Iuppiter
Conservator, Iuppiter Tonans, Ops, Mars Ultor, Fortuna Primigenia,
and probably of Mens and Venus Erycina; as well as of several altars
or shrines-the great altar of Jupiter (see <ref target="iuppiter-optimus-maximus-capitolinus-aedes" n="U">TEMPLE OF JUPITER</ref>), of
Iuppiter Soter, Isis and Serapis, Bellona, Genius Populi Romani with
Felicitas and Venus Victrix, the gens Iulia, and perhaps Iuppiter Victor
<pb n="49"/>
and Indulgentia (see all these under their own names). The temple of
Fides probably stood at the south-west corner of the area, but the site
of the others is unknown. <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The foundations of the house which Caligula laid here (Suet. Cal. 22, mox, quo propior esset-to Jupiter Capitolinus-in area Capitolina novae domus fundamenta iecit) must
have been removed after his death.</note></p>
<p>There were also many statues of various deities set up in the area and
in the temples (Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. ii. 319</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">in Capitolio omnium  deorum
simulacra colebantur</foreign>; cf. Tert. Spect. 12; Jord.i. 2. 50-51; Rodocanachi
43-44). One of Jupiter, of colossal size, was erected by Sp. Carvilius
in <date value="-293">293 B.C.</date> and could be seen from the temple of Iuppiter Latiaris on the
Alban mount (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 34</bibl>, 43); a second stood on a high pillar and
after <date value="-63">63 B.C.</date> was turned to face the east (Cic. <bibl>Cat. iii. 20</bibl>; de div. i. 20;

<foreign xml:lang="la">sacrarium est locus in quo sacra reponuntur</foreign>; <bibl>Jord. ii. 271-281</bibl>) situated
at various points in the four Servian regions (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 45-54</bibl>) that
were visited in order on the Ides of May (Ov. <bibl>Fast. v. 621-622</bibl>; cf. 603)
by a solemn lustral procession in which the priests, the vestals, and
the city praetor took part. This procession afterwards halted on the
pons Sublicius and threw into the Tiber twenty-seven straw puppets,
called Argei (Varro, <bibl>LL vii. 44</bibl>, where XXVII not XXIIII is to be read; Fest.
15, 334; Plut. q. Rom. 32, 86; <bibl>Dionys. i. 38</bibl>, where the number 30 is an
error). The sacraria themselves, as well as the puppets, were called
Argei (<bibl>Liv. i. 21</bibl>. 5), or Argea (Fest. 19). On the sixteenth and seventeenth of March (Ov. <bibl>Fast. iii. 791</bibl> ; cf. <bibl>Gell. x. 15</bibl>. 30) a similar procession
visited the sacraria, and may very probably have deposited in them the
puppets that were to be taken out in May.</p>
<p>As to the meaning and origin of Argei, and of the ceremony itself,
both ancient and modern writers have expressed the most diverse views,
and there is a voluminous literature on the subject. It is probable that
the institution was introduced into Rome from  Greece between the
first and second Punic wars, in accordance with the instructions of the
Sibylline books; perhaps the first celebration was actually carried out
with human victims for whom the straw puppets were afterwards substituted (for the Argei in general and the literature of the subject, see

People, 54ff., 321 ff.; Rose, Quaestiones Romanae of Plutarch, 98-110

explanation of it as the throwing of the corn spirit into the water).</p>
<p>Varro (<bibl>LL v. 45-54</bibl>) mentions fourteen of these sacraria, quoting in the case of twelve from what was evidently the official record of the pontiffs that directed the order of the procession from one to another. This gives, for each region, first the name of the hill or distinctive locality, then the
number of the shrine, and finally further topographical details, some of
which date from the time of introduction of the ceremony and some of
them from later periods. The two that are not mentioned in this formal
manner are the first and sixth of the regio Suburana respectively on the
mons Caelius and in the Subura, i.e. the <ref target="succusa" n="U">SUCUSA</ref> (q.v.), and not to be

seven that had its own independent building, and that the others were
parts of, or within the precincts of, other buildings.</p>

<p>Of the twelve sacraria described by Varro, eleven can thus be located

Camillus erected the temple of <ref target="iuno-moneta-aedes" n="U">IUNO MONETA</ref> (q.v.) in <date value="-344">344 B.C.</date>  One

<p>The original topography of the arx is quite uncertain; for the construction of the church and cloisters of S. Maria in Aracoeli in the <dateRange from="800" to="899"> ninth
century</dateRange> changed completely all previous conditions (cf. Rodocanachi,
Le Capitole 237-242).  When the foundations were laid for the great
national monument of Victor Emmanuel, which now covers most of the
arx north of the Aracoeli and the slope of the hill below, some traces of
the scarped cliff and the tufa walls of the primitive fortification of the
hill were found  <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The description given seems to show that they were built of 2-foot blocks of tufa
like the other sections which at the time of their discovery were believed to be primitive,
from which indeed it is very doubtful whether they should be differentiated (see especially
<bibl>Mitt. 1889, 254</bibl>). For illustrations of one of the sections on the north-east, see Primo

and fragments of three sections of the later so-called Servian wall which
passed around the north corner of the hill. Two of these sections were

It is not to be confused with the Aedes Libertatis on the Aventine, and
probably not with the shrine or monument that is marked with the word
Libertatis on the Marble Plan in the north apse of the basilica Ulpia

<p>The first runs thus: <foreign xml:lang="la">Senatus populusque Romanus Libertati</foreign> (in
large letters on a marble slab); and the second, <foreign xml:lang="la">Libertati ab. imp.
Nerva Caesare Aug. anno ab urbe condita DCCCXXXVIII, XIIII K. Oct.
restitutae S.P.Q.R.</foreign>  Hulsen supposes, very naturally, that the first
inscription belonged to the dedicatory inscription of a shrine with the
statue of Libertas (near the curia, not on the Capitol) under which the
second inscription could very well have stood (<bibl>Mitt. 1889, 240</bibl>, 241).
There is no other reference until the <dateRange from="500" to="599"> sixth century</dateRange>, when an inscription
was set up in some part of the curia as follows (<bibl>CIL vi. 1794</bibl>): <foreign xml:lang="la">salvis

one, and Mommsen (Hermes, 1888, 631-633) has collected several references to the building in Cassiodorus and Ennodius. Of other earlier

been along the line of the successive imperial fora, passing the comitium,

history of the restored building of Pollio, and its relation to that part of
the curia that bore its name in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century<dateRange>, are unknown. The

<p>* the house of the Vestal Virgins at the foot of the Palatine,
just east of the forum proper. By the end of the republic this term
had come to mean their dwelling-house, in which sense it is ordinarily
used in extant literature (Fest. 333 ; <bibl>Gell. i. 12</bibl>. 9; Plin. <bibl>Ep. vii. 19</bibl>. 2;
Prud. <bibl>Peristeph. ii. 528</bibl>), but originally it included the whole precinct
of Vesta (cf. Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 263</bibl>; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vii. 153</bibl>). This precinct
contained the temple of <ref target="vesta-aedes" n="U">VESTA</ref> (q.v.), the dwelling of the Vestals, the
sacred grove, the domus Publica or official residence of the pontifex
maximus, and the <ref target="regia" n="U">REGIA</ref> (q.v.) itself or house of the king. This group
was called both Regia and atrium Vestae (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 263-264</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">hic
locus exiguus qui sustinet atria Vestae [ tunc erat intonsi regia magna
Numae</foreign>; cf. the confused terms atrium regium (<bibl>Liv. xxvi. 27</bibl>. 3; <bibl>xxvii.
11</bibl>. 16, in reference to the fire of <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date>) and regia Vestae (<bibl>CIL vi. 511</bibl>).</p>
<p>The grove, <foreign xml:lang="la">lucus</foreign> (Cic. de div. i. 101 ; <bibl>BC 1905, 208-210</bibl>; Me1. 1908,
238-240), originally covered the space between the atrium and the
Palatine, but was gradually encroached upon, and finally disappeared
entirely, as it would seem. The domus Publica (Suet. Caes. 46) still
continued to be the residence of the pontifex maximus until Augustus,
on assuming that office in <date value="-12">12 B.C.</date>, transferred it to the Palatine (Cass. <bibl>Dio
liv. 27</bibl>) and presented the domus Publica to the Vestals (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst.
1889, 247</bibl>). In <date value="-36">36 B.C.</date> Domitius Calvinus built the marble Regia, an
entirely separate structure. After the republic, therefore, the precinct
of Vesta included the temple, the grove, and the actual dwelling of the
Vestals, to which the name atrium was generally restricted. This name
would lead us to infer that the court, atrium, was the most prominent
part of the precinct, and it was certainly large enough for meetings of
the senate (Serv. <bibl>Aen. vii. 153</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">ad atrium Vestae conveniebat (senatus)
quod a templo remotum fuerat-a disputed passage</foreign>, cf. Van Deman,
Atrium Vestae 10).</p>
<p>Knowledge of the history of the atrium must be derived from the
evidence of the ruins themselves. Some discoveries were made in 1549
(Lanciani, <bibl>Storia ii. 203</bibl>), and extensive excavations were carried out in
1883 and 1899-1902 (for the results in 1883 see Lanciani, <bibl>NS 1883, 468-470</bibl>,

<pb n="59"/></p>
<p>These excavations show some remains of the republican atrium, that
is, the house of the Vestals, immediately south of the temple, adjoining
the domus Publica on the east, with the same north and south orientation.
This indicates the antiquity of both, though almost no remains earlier
than the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange> are now visible. They consist of a small
court with rows of rooms on the south and west sides, with walls and
pavements still visible at some points under the north-west corner of
the latest building; that of the court is a lithostroton pavement of
the Sullan period (<bibl>JRS 1922, 29</bibl>). The domus Publica seems to have
been larger than the house of the Vestals, and to have occupied all the
space between the Sacra via and the earlier Nova via. Its remains,
forming virtually a part of the original atrium (there is, in any case, no
line of demarcation between the two), lie along the north side of the
latest building and were entirely covered up by the road that Nero built
here in front of the shops (see below) (TF 85-86; (Ill. 7)).</p>
<p>Close to the main entrance to the atrium, at its north-west corner,
is the podium, about 3 by 2 metres in dimensions, of a shrine, generally
called aedicula Vestae, and supposed to have been built to house a
statue of the goddess, as the temple itself did not contain any (Cic. de nat.
<bibl>Deor. iii. 80</bibl>; de or. iii. 10). This shrine was not built until the second
stage of the imperial atrium, for it blocked a door belonging to that
period (Van Deman, op. cit. 23). Some fragments of the marble lining
and plinth are in situ; and the entablature with an inscription of the
time of Hadrian (<bibl>CIL vi. 31578</bibl>) which records a restoration, together
with numerous architectural bits, have been found. The entablature
has been placed upon a column and a brick pier (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 290-291;
Der Tempel d. Vesta 25-28; HC 203 ; Thedenat 315; LR 226).</p>
<p>The atrium Vestae was probably destroyed in the fire of Nero, and
was certainly rebuilt by him, when he remodelled the whole of this quarter
in a different form and with a different orientation. It now consisted
of a trapezoidal enclosure (in which the temple was included) approximately the size of the later building, with a central court surrounded
by rooms on three sides. Against the north enclosure wall was a row
of tabernae opening into the arcade leading up to the vestibule of the
<ref target="aurea-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUREA</ref> (q.v.); and the porticus occupied the whole intervening
space between the eastern enclosure wall and the street connecting the
Sacra and Nova via to the east (Vicus Vestae ?). There is thus no space
left for the garden, which, it was thought, might have been a survival
of the lucus (see VESTA, LUCUS); compare Van Deman, Atrium Vestae
pl. A, with AJA 1923, p. 421 and pl. iii., and Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. v. 124</bibl> and
pls. 6, 62.</p>
<p>This building was injured by fire, and restored by Domitian, who
erected a colonnade round the court, with a long, shallow piscina in the
centre, and entirely rebuilt the west end. Hadrian built a block of
rooms across the east end, thereby extending the area of the house as
<pb n="60"/>
        
far as the cross street mentioned above; he also closed in the front
of the largest room (13 on Van Deman's plans) on the south, and built
new back walls in this and the room next to it. This was continued
under the Antonines, the object being to diminish the damp, due to the
shutting off of the sun's rays by Hadrian's additions to the <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref> (q.v.). For the same reason the floor level was raised about
0.70 metre. In this period, too, Hadrian's additions were linked up
with the rest of the house, and a second and third story were added over
them. Finally, after suffering injury in the fire of Commodus, the
atrium was restored by Julia Domna, and the courtyard lengthened to
69 metres (it was, as before, 24 metres wide) so as to occupy the whole
of the central area. It was then that the arches spanning the Nova via
were built, serving as a support both to the upper stories of the atrium
and to the structures on the lower slopes of the Palatine (Ill. 8).
After this date various minor alterations were made, including the
construction, in the Constantinian period, of an octagonal structure
enclosing a circle in the centre of the peristyle (perhaps the foundation
of a pavilion, or the edging of a garden bed) and of two small piscinae,
one at each end, to replace the large one, which was no longer in
symmetry with the plan (Ill. 6).</p>
<p>After the last restoration the central court was surrounded by a
double colonnade, replaced at a still later period by a brick wall pierced
by arches.  Round the court stood numerous statues of Virgines
Vestales Maximae on inscribed pedestals (<bibl>AJA  1908, 324-342</bibl>; <bibl>CIL
vi. 32409-32428</bibl>; <bibl>HF ii. 1243</bibl>, 1357-61; PT pp. 76-78, Nos. 39, 42).
At the east end was a large hall paved with fine marbles, with three
rooms on each side of it; on the south of it is a small hall, with a sort of
vaulted cellar (possibly the penus of the household) and to the north
is a room in which an archaic altar, belonging to the Republican house,
has been found. On the south side of the courtyard is a group of rooms
used for household purposes, after which comes a series of finely decorated
rooms. At the west end are some rooms which are cut off from the
courtyard, and may, it is thought, have served for the cult of the Lares
(cf. <ref target="lares-aedes" n="U">LARES, AEDES</ref>); and further west still are rooms probably used for
the cult of Vesta in connection with the temple. Two hoards of coins
were found in the house-830 Saxon coins, dating down to the <date value="950">middle
of the tenth century</date>, in 1883 (<bibl>NS 1883, 487-514</bibl>), and 397 gold coins
dating <dateRange from="335" to="472">from 335 to 467-472 A.D.</dateRange> in 1899 (ib. 1899, 327-330).</p>
<p>A statue of Numa with a head of an ideal Greek type of the <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth
century B.C.</dateRange>, with a space for a bronze beard, was found in the house of
the Vestals. As the body shows, it probably belongs to the period
of Trajan (<bibl>BC 1919, 211-224</bibl>). The head shows evidence of the rite of
resectio (see <ref target="lucus-furrinae" n="U">LUCUS FURRINAE</ref>). </p>

<placeName>AUDITORIUM MAECENATIS</placeName>
</head> 
<p>the modern name of the remains of a building that stands in the angle between the via Merulana and the via Leopardi.
<pb n="61"/>
This building is constructed of opus reticulatum of the time of Augustus,
and stands obliquely across the line of the Servian wall. In form it is
a rectangular hall with a semi-circular apse at the west end, the total
length being 24.10 metres and the width 10.60. Since the floor is 7 metres
below the ancient level of the ground, the hall had to be entered by an
inclined plane. The walls reach 6 metres above the ancient ground
level, and the roof was probably vaulted. In the apse are seven rows of
curved steps, arranged like the cavea of a theatre. Above the steps
in the apse are five niches, and six more in each of the side walls of the
hall. All of these were beautifully painted with garden scenes and
landscapes in the third Pompeian style, but the frescoes have mostly
disappeared. The original pavement was of white mosaic, over which
a later pavement of marble was laid. The purpose of this hall is unknown.
It is probably not an auditorium, but may have been a sort of conservatory, although it is difficult to see how it could have been properly lighted.
It has been ascribed to Maecenas because his <ref target="horti-maecenatis" n="U">HORTI</ref> (q.v.) were supposed
to have extended as far south as this point, but this is very uncertain
(HJ 351; <bibl>AJA 1912, 390</bibl>, 394; Reber 488-491; Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1874,

Tiberius and Livia (ib. Ivi. 46. 3; the assignment to Livia alone by
Pliny (<bibl>NH xii. 94</bibl>) is of course an error. According to Suetonius, Tiberius
did not finish the temple, and it was completed by Caligula (Tib. 47:<foreign xml:lang="la">quae sola susceperat Augusti templum  restitutionemque Pompeiani

Pompeiani theatri, eaque perfecta  contemptu	ambitionis an  per

temple were statues of Augustus (see below) of Livia, set up by Claudius
(Cass. <bibl>Dio lx. 5</bibl>), and probably of other emperors who were deified (see

1-12, 618, 797-810; cf. HC fig. 100) show an octastyle building with
Corinthian capitals, and two statues, presumably of Augustus and Livia,
in the cella. The last reference to the temple is on a diploma of 248
<pb n="63"/>
(CIL iii. p. 900, No. lvii.), and it is not mentioned in the Regionary
Catalogue. We are told of one painting in the temple, that of Hyacinthus
by Nicias of Athens, which was placed there by Tiberius (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv.
131</bibl>).</p>
<p>Everywhere in Latin literature this temple is called <foreign xml:lang="la">templum Augusti</foreign>
or <foreign xml:lang="la">divi Augusti</foreign>, except in Martial (iv. 53. 2) and Suetonius (Tib. 74),
where it is <foreign xml:lang="la">templum novum</foreign>, a name which was evidently given to the
building at once, for it occurs in the Acta Arvalia from <date value="36">36 A.D.</date> on (<bibl>CIL
vi. 32346</bibl>, 10; 2041, 5; 2042a, 28; 2051, 14), as well as the variant
<foreign xml:lang="la">templum divi Augusti novum </foreign>(2028e, 12; 2044c, 5; 32345; also vi. 8704).
Once we find <foreign xml:lang="la">templum divi Augusti et divae Augustae </foreign>(vi. 4222). In
<date value="69">69 A.D.</date> an <foreign xml:lang="la">aedes Caesarum</foreign> was struck by lightning (Suet. Galba I: <foreign xml:lang="la">tacta
de caelo Caesarum aede capita omnibus simul statuis deciderunt, Augusti
etiam sceptrum e manibus excussum est</foreign>), and may perhaps be identified
with this temple of Augustus (HJ 80). In connection with the temple
Tiberius seems to have erected a library, <ref target="bibliotheca-templi-d-augusti" n="U">BIBLIOTHECA TEMPLI NOVI</ref> or
<ref target="augustus-divus-templum" n="U">TEMPLI AUGUSTI</ref> (q.v.). Over this temple Caligula built his famous
bridge to connect the Palatine and Capitoline hills (Suet. Cal. 22: <foreign xml:lang="la">super
templum divi Augusti ponte transmisso Palatium Capitoliumque coniunxit</foreign>), and its location is thereby indicated as somewhere on the north-
west side of the Palatine, below the domus Tiberiana.</p>
<p>Of the construction of the original temple before the restoration by
Antoninus, we know nothing from ancient sources other than coins. It
has generally been supposed that a bronze coin of Caligula (<dateRange from="37" to="40">37-40 A.D.</dateRange>,
Cohen, Cal. 9-11; HC fig. 99) represents it, and was struck to commemorate its completion or dedication. This coin represents an Ionic hexastyle
structure, decorated with sculptures on the roof, within the pediment,
and in front, and with garlands. Recently, however, this identification
has been attacked by Richmond (op. cit. 198-203) who maintains that the
temple of Caligula's coin is that of <ref target="apollo-palatinus-aedes" n="U">APOLLO PALATINUS</ref> (q.v.), while the
temple of Augustus is represented on bronze coins of Tiberius of <dateRange from="34" to="36">34-36 A.D.</dateRange>
(Cohen, Tib. 68-70). These show a hexastyle structure of the Corinthian
order, with sculpture above the pediment, statues of Hercules and
Mercury on pedestals beside the steps, a statue of Augustus in the cella,
and around the back of the building a high curved wall-the <foreign xml:lang="la">murus post
templum Augusti</foreign> of the diplomata (see above).</p>
<p>Still more recently it has been maintained that the temple of Concord
is represented on the coins of Tiberius, while that of Augustus is shown
on those of Caligula (BM Imp. i. pp. cxxxviii, cxlvi; Tib. 116, 132-134;
Cal. 41-43, 58, 69).</p>
<p>The structure generally known as the temple of Augustus and the
<foreign xml:lang="la">bibliotheca templi divi Augusti </foreign>has recently been completely uncovered
by the removal of the church of S. Maria Liberatrice (Ill. 9). It is a
large rectangular construction of brick-faced concrete, with very lofty
and massive walls, and belongs to the period of Domitian. That it forms
<pb n="64"/>
          
a single structural unit is shown very clearly by the unbroken lines of
bonding courses of tiles which run right through it. It consists of:</p>
<p>(a) A large rectangular hall, with its main facade towards the vicus
Tuscus; in front of it was a vestibule 6 metres deep and 32 wide, with
a large niche at each end. The front wall of this vestibule has collapsed,
and we have only the six (originally eight) short cross walls that were
built to support it by Hadrian. The hall behind was about 25 metres
deep, and in its walls were rectangular and semicircular niches, arranged
alternately; above them the walls rose straight, with several rows of
relieving niches, and no trace at all of any intermediate floor. The light
came from a large rectangular window in the upper part of each side wall
(smaller windows seem to have been originally intended). How it was
roofed is uncertain; if by a vault, it was the highest in antiquity, the
key being 150 feet from  the pavement (Rivoira, RA  110-111).  No
fragments of the supposed vaulting have, however, been found.</p>
<p>(b) Two smaller halls behind the large hall, accessible by doors from
the back of it,<note anchored="true" place="foot">In the westernmost of these passage ways some frescoes of the seventh or eighth
centuries A.D. were found in 1885, and the passage itself was, as a result, wrongly attributed
to that period (<bibl>NS 1885, 156</bibl>).
</note> but arranged on an axis parallel to its width and having
their main entrance on this axis, i.e. from the north-east, behind the
lacus Iuturnae. The first of these halls measures about 21 metres by 20,
and its walls are decorated with niches. The second was a peristyle, with
four brick piers at the angles, with grey granite columns between them,
surrounding the central open court. At its south-west end were three
rectangular rooms (the apse in the central one does not even belong to
the earliest period of its decoration as a church), and behind them a
solid wall, which, with the triangular space on the south-west side of
the front hall, served to conceal the divergence of orientation with the
<ref target="horrea-agrippiana" n="U">HORREA AGRIPPIANA</ref> (q.v.). From each of these halls a door leads into
the ramp ascending to the Palatine (see <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref>).</p>
<p>The church of S. Maria Antiqua was built into the two smaller halls
before the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century A.D.</dateRange>, and was redecorated in part in or about
649, 705, 741, 757, and 772.  It was partially abandoned after the
earthquake of Leo IV in 847, and the church of S. Maria Nuova (S.
Francesca Romana) was founded to replace it: though the presence of
a huge pillar in the centre of the piscina of the peristyle of Caligula
shows that a last effort was made to support the falling vaulting;
and Wilpert assigns some of the paintings in the front hall to the <dateRange from="900" to="999">tenth
century.</dateRange> In the <dateRange from="1200" to="1299">thirteenth century</dateRange> the small basilica of S. Maria libera
nos a poenis inferni (S. Maria Liberatrice) was erected above the site of
the older church.</p>
<p>In 1702 the upper part of the back wall of S. Maria Antiqua was
brought to light, but covered up again; but the whole church has now
been cleared (HCh 309; Rushforth in <bibl>PBS i. 1-123</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 74-82</bibl>;

227-228; Leclercq in Cabrol, <bibl>Dict. v. 2006-2047</bibl>; RE <bibl>Suppl. iv. 471-473</bibl>).</p>
<p>The original purpose of the whole group has not yet been determined.
Against the identification with the <foreign xml:lang="la">templum divi Augusti </foreign>we may note
(a) that no traces attributable to the original temple have so far been
found below the level of the building of Domitian, and that there is indeed
no room for any such structure, (b) that what lies before us does not
agree with the representation on the coins of Antoninus Pius, which
would of course show the portico added to the building by Hadrian
(<bibl>AJA 1924, 397</bibl>). And if the front hall cannot be the temple of Augustus,
it is hard to see how the hall behind it can be called the temple of
Minerva, or how S. Maria Antiqua can be identified with the bibliotheca,
even if the suitability of its plan be admitted. On the other hand, it is
difficult-we may say impossible-to find any other place for the temple
of Augustus, which, as we have seen, was still in existence in <date value="248">248 A.D.</date></p>
<p>The theory that the whole group may have taken the place of the great
peristyle which Caligula erected as a vestibule to the imperial palace
on the Palatine above, and have been an imperial reception hall, is
rendered improbable by the inadequacy of the approaches from the
front hall to those at the back (S. Maria Antiqua); see <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref>.

<p>the southernmost of the hills of Rome, stretching
south-east from the Tiber; it is trapezoidal in shape, with sides that
measure, beginning with that towards the river, about 500, 600, 750,
600 metres in length. It rises abruptly from the bank of the river on
the north and south-west. Its height near S. Alessio is 46 metres above
sea-level. Along the south-east side of this trapezoidal hill is a depression,
through which ran the ancient <ref target="vicus-portae-raudusculanae" n="U">VICUS PORTAE RAUDUSCULANAE</ref> (q.v.),
followed by the modern Viale di porta S. Paolo, and beyond this depression
<pb n="66"/>
rises another elevation which gradually sloped off to the Almo beyond
the;line of the Aurelian wall. This part of the hill, on which stand the
churches of S. Saba and S. Balbina, is sometimes called the pseudo-
Aventine (see below), but is usually included under the Aventine. The
line of the 'Servian' <note anchored="true" place="foot"> There are, however, no traces in this section of any construction earlier than <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date>
(see <ref target="murus-servii-tullii" n="U">MURUS SERVII TULLII</ref>). 
</note> wall-crossed this eastern elevation south of S. Saba
and west of S. Balbina, and thus included a section that was considerably
smaller than the trapezoidal hill to the north-west.</p>
<p>Whether Aventinus originally included both these parts of the hill
has been the subject of much discussion and cannot be regarded as
settled.  Ennius (ap. Cic. de <bibl>Div. i. 107</bibl>) seems to distinguish sharply
between them, while later, in the last century of the republic and early
empire, it is clear that the name was ordinarily applied to both (Varro,
<bibl>LL v. 163</bibl>; Suet. reliq. (Roth) 291; Fest. 276; Plut. Rom. 9). The
probability is that the original name of the western section by the Tiber,
following the analogy of other similar names, was gradually extended to
the part of the eastern hill included within the Servian wall. This inclusion
is strengthened by the statements of Dionysius who, in his description
of the Aventine, gives its circumference once (iii. 43) as eighteen stadia,
and elsewhere (x. 31) as twelve. The latter figure is too small even for
the western part, and must be considered as an error; the-former corresponds quite closely to that area enclosed within the line of the Servian
wall on both hills, and evidently refers to that. In strictly official
language Aventinus may always have remained the designation of the
western half only. A  fragment of the Acta Arvalia recently found
(<bibl>NS 1914, 473</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1914, 37</bibl>; DAP 2. xii. 37; <bibl>BCr 1915, 66</bibl>: in clivo
capsar(io) in Aventino maior(i) ), of <date value="240">240 A.D.</date>, indicates clearly that then
at any rate Aventinus maior, the main part of the hill, was distinguished
from Aventinus minor, the part now called the pseudo-Aventine.</p>
<p>When names were given to the Augustan divisions of the city, the
thirteenth was called Aventinus; while the twelfth, comprising the
eastern part of the hill, was the Piscina Publica (for a full discussion
of this question, see Merlin, L'Aventin dans l'Antiquite, <bibl>Paris 1906,
5-14</bibl>, and literature there cited; HJ 149-157).</p>
<p>According to the traditional view (<bibl>Gilbert ii. 144-257</bibl>) the Aventine,
although it was surrounded by the wall of Servius Tullius, remained
outside the pomerium  until the time of Claudius, and this exclusion
was due to religious scruples connected with the founding of the city
(<bibl>Gell. xiii. 14</bibl>). Another explanation of this exclusion-is that the hill
was not included within any wall until the Servian wall was rebuilt in

<p>The name Aventinus is still unexplained, in spite of the many etymologies offered by Roman antiquarians (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 45</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. i. 3</bibl>. 9;
Fest. 19; Verg. <bibl>Aen. vii. 657</bibl>, and Servius, ad loc.; Lydus, de mag. i. 34;
<bibl>Jord. i. 1</bibl>. 180-183; HJ 151-153; Merlin, op. cit. 26-36). The suggestion
that the word represents an ancient Italian, or perhaps Ligurian, settlement may possibly find some support in the use of <ref target="pagus-aventinensis" n="U">PAGUS AVENTINENSIS</ref>
(q.v.). The statement of Festus (148: <foreign xml:lang="la">Murciae deae sacellum  erat
sub monte Aventino qui antea Murcus vocabatur</foreign>) is probably false.</p>
<p>According to tradition, the Aventine was public domain until <date value="-456">456 B.C.</date>
when, by the lex Icilia, a portion of it was handed over to the plebs for
settlement (<bibl>Dionys. iii. 43</bibl>, x. 31-32; <bibl>Liv. iii. 31</bibl>). It continued to be
an essentially plebeian quarter until the empire, when many wealthy
Romans built their residences there, but it was always a comparatively
unimportant part of the city and contained few monumental structures
(for a full description of the topography and monuments of the Aventine,
see Merlin, op. cit.;. HJ 149-170; P1. 413-417, 421-422). </p>

<p> * the name given by the Romans to a very common type of
building erected for business purposes and also for the accommodation of
the courts. It usually consisted of a rectangular hall, of considerable
height, surrounded by one or two ambulatories, sometimes with galleries,
and lighted by openings in the upper part of the side walls. The hall
often ended in an apse or exedra. There were numerous variants in detail
from this type, but the general effect was the same. For discussions of
the basilica in general, see <bibl>RE iii. 83</bibl> ff.; <bibl>DS. i. 677</bibl> ff.</p>
<p>The recent discovery of the underground basilica just outside the
Porta Maggiore has somewhat modified the views previously held; Here
we have a building, undoubtedly pagan, belonging to the <dateRange from="1" to="99">first century</dateRange>
after Christ, which already shows, fully developed, the plan of the
Christian basilica with a nave and two aisles, separated by pillars supporting arches (Giovannoni in DAP 2. xv. 113). This basilica is not mentioned
in classical literature, and was quite unexpectedly discovered in 1915.
It was reached by a long subterranean passage, with two lightshafts
(which has now been closed up, a new approach having been constructed
from the via Praenestina), which led into a square vestibule with a larger
shaft. (It was the earth falling into this shaft (which lay right under the
Naples railway line) which led to the discovery of the basilica.} The
vestibule was decorated with painted stucco; and from it a window over
the entrance door threw scanty light into the basilica itself, which was
decorated entirely with reliefs in white stucco. The subjects are very
varied, and have given rise to much discussion. The basilica can be inferred from them to have served for the meetings of a neo-Pythagorean
sect which believed in a future life, as they can all be referred to the
adventures of the soul in its passage towards the otherworld, the scene in
the apse showing the actual plunge into the purifying flood. The worship
was obviously secret: and the building was probably constructed in such
a way as to excite as little attention as possible, the piers having been
made by excavating pits, which were then filled with concrete. The
vaults and arches were supported until the concrete had set on the solid
<pb n="72"/>
                
earth (not on scaffolding) which accounts for their irregularity: and it
was only afterwards that the earth was cleared out from beneath.</p>
<p>See <bibl>NS 1918, 30-52</bibl>, for the original discovery; and Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad.
iv. 79-87</bibl>, Strong and Jolliffe in <bibl>JHS 1924, 65-111</bibl>, and Carcopino, La
Basilique Pythagoricienne de la Porte Majeure, Paris, 1927, for a full
description, with references to the voluminous literature of the subject.
Bendinelli's attempt in <bibl>BC 1922, 85-126</bibl>, to prove it to have been a tomb
can hardly be accepted. A fully illustrated official account is to be
expected. </p>

<p>on the north side of the forum, between the
curia and the temple of Faustina. In <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> the censor M. Fulvius
Nobilior contracted for the building of a basilica '<foreign xml:lang="la">post argentarias novas</foreign>'
(<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>). In 159 P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, when censor, installed
a water clock in basilica Aemilia et Fulvia (Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 4</bibl>; cf. Censorin.
de die nat. 23. 7; Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 215</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">idque horologium sub tecto dicavit
a.u. DXCV</foreign>). This use of the double name, Aemilia et Fulvia, would seem
to indicate that it was thus given in Varro's source, and was a usual,
perhaps the official, designation of the building in the <date value="-150">middle of the second
century B.C.</date>, and that it had not wholly dropped out of use in Varro's
own time. If so, Fulvius' colleague in the censorship of 179, M. Aemilius
Lepidus, must have had at least equal responsibility in its construction,
notwithstanding Livy's statement, a hypothesis that is supported by
references to the later history of the basilica. In <date value="-78">78 B.C.</date>, the consul
M. Aemilius Lepidus decorated the building (here called basilica Aemilia)
with engraved shields or portraits of his ancestors (Plin. NHxxxv. 13),
and probably restored it somewhat; for a coin of his son Lepidus, triumvir
monetalis about <date value="-65">65</date> (Babelon i. p. 129, No. 25; BM <bibl>Rep. i. 450</bibl>. 3650-3) <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Restored by Trajan (Babelon, ii p. 573, No. 7).</note>
represents it as a two-storied porticus on which shields are hung with
the legend M. Lepidus <foreign xml:lang="la">ref(ecta) s(enatus) c(onsulto)</foreign>.  In <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>, the
aedile L. Aemilius Paullus, brother of the triumvir (<bibl>RE i. 564</bibl>), undertook
to restore the basilica with money furnished by Caesar from Gaul (Plut.
Caes. 29 [where the earlier building is called Fulvia only]; App. <bibl>BC
ii. 26</bibl>; Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 16</bibl>. 14). The theory that Paullus had almost
finished the building, when he decided to rebuild entirely and gave out a
new contract, does not seem correct (TF 67). The beauty of this restored
building is emphasised by Plutarch and Appian. Cicero says that Paullus
used the ancient columns of the earlier structure. Nevertheless, he does
not seem to have completed the work, for in <date value="-34">34 B.C.</date> his son L. Aemilius
Lepidus Paullus, when consul, finished and dedicated the building
(Cass. <bibl>Dio xlix. 42</bibl>).</p>
<p>In all references to the basilica after <date value="-54">54</date> B.C., except those cited above
from Varro, Pliny and Plutarch, it appears as basilica Paulli (Stat. <bibl>Silv.
i. 1</bibl>. 30: regia Pauli), so that this, rather than basilica Aemilia, was
probably its ordinary name.
<pb n="73"/></p>
<p>In <date value="-14">14 B.C.</date> it was burned, and rebuilt in the name of the Aemilius who
then represented the family (probably the same man who carried out the
restoration of <date value="22">22 A.D.</date>), but really by Augustus and the friends of Paullus
(Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 24</bibl>). Still later, in <date value="22">22 A.D.</date>, M. Aemilius Lepidus, son of
the restorer of <date value="-34">34 B.C.</date>, asked the senate for permission to carry out another
restoration at his own expense, according to Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. iii. 72</bibl>), who
calls the building <foreign xml:lang="la">basilica Pauli Aemilia  monumenta</foreign>. Pliny (<bibl>NH
xxxvi.  102</bibl>), reckons it, the forum  of Augustus and the temple of
Peace, as the three most beautiful buildings in the world, and mentions
its columns of Phrygian marble as very wonderful. These must have
stood in the interior of the basilica, but we do not know to which restoration they belong, and no traces whatever of them have been found in the
ruins; while those of the basilica of S. Paolo fuori le Mura are 1.19 metres
in diameter, and therefore too large. After the first century the basilica
is mentioned only on one inscription on a slave's collar (<bibl>CIL xv. 7189</bibl>:
in basilica Paulli), in the Regionary Catalogue (<rs key="regio4" type="region">Reg. IV</rs>), and in Polemius
Silvius (p. 545). It is represented in a fragment of the Marble Plan
(<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 53</bibl>, fig. 13; cf. <bibl>AJA 1913, 15</bibl>, n. i).</p>
<p>Dr. E. Van Deman has propounded (<bibl>AJA 1913, 26-28</bibl>) a theory (I) that
the porticus Gai et Luci is to be identified with the front arcades of the
basilica Aemilia; and (2) that the name porticus Iulia (Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi. 27</bibl>. 5
-though the MSS. have Livia, HJ 315-Schol. Pers. sat. iv. 49: <foreign xml:lang="la">foeneratores ad puteal Scribonis Licini <note anchored="true" place="foot">1 Vulg.: <foreign xml:lang="la">Scribonii Libonis </foreign>is the emendation generally adopted.
</note>quod est in porticu Iulia ad Fabianum
arcum</foreign>) was applied to it at a later date. If she is right in identifying
the remains of the arch with some blocks of tufa on the north side
of the temple of Caesar (<bibl>JRS 1922, 26-28</bibl>), the latter postulate is perhaps
to be conceded; for the fornix Fabianus cannot have stood anywhere
near the basilica Iulia (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>.210). In that case Suet. Aug. 29 <foreign xml:lang="la">porticum
basilicamque Gai et Luci </foreign>must then refer to two separate monuments:
for whatever the porticus may be, the basilica Gai et Luci must be the
basilica Iulia (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 13-16</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">basilicam quae fuit inter aedem
Castoris et aedem Saturni ... nominis filiorum meum  incohavi</foreign>). But
the passage of Dio refers to a dedication in <date value="12">12 A.D.</date>, which will not fit
the date of the inscription of Lucius Caesar (<date value="-2">2 B.C.</date>, see p. 74) any
more than it agrees with the date of the dedication of the porticus Liviae.</p>
<p>The remains of the basilica Aemilia, of which nothing was previously
visible, have been for the most part laid bare by the recent excavations.
It occupied the whole space between the temple of Faustina (from which
it was separated by a narrow passage) and the Argiletum.</p>
<p>There are some remains, including a column base which probably
belongs to the earliest period of the basilica, of the structures of <date value="-179">179</date>,
<date value="-78">78</date>, and <date value="-34">34 B.C.</date> (TF 66-75), or of <date value="-78">78</date> and <date value="-54">54 B.C.</date> (<bibl>JRS 1922, 29-31</bibl>), but
it is clear that little change was made in the extent and plan of the basilica
in the rebuildings of <date value="-14">14 B.C.</date> and <date value="22">22 A.D.</date>
<pb n="74"/>
                </p>
<p>It consisted of a main hall, divided into a nave and two aisles by
two orders of columns of africano marble, respectively 0.85 metre and
0.55 metre in diameter, with bases and capitals <note anchored="true" place="foot">1 In Zeitschr. f. Gesch. d. Archit. viii. <bibl>(1924)</bibl>, 73, objection is taken to the proposed
restoration of the lower order with Ionic columns in Toeb. cit. infra.
</note> of white marble, and
finely carved entablatures of the same material: two fragments of the
main entablature, which show traces of later injury by fire, bear the
remains of an inscription  <foreign xml:lang="la">... PAVL ... RESTI...</foreign> On the north-east
side of the nave there was a second line of columns, but as it lies only
about 4 feet from the outer wall, the intervening space cannot be treated
as a second aisle. The object of this inequality may have been to give
extra support, as there were probably no tabernae here. The pavement
is of slabs of fine coloured marbles (giallo, cipollino, porta santa).</p>
<p>The main hall was about 90 metres long and 27 wide; it is most
probable, though not certain, that it had no apsidal termination at either
end. It was lighted by a clerestory, to which belong some pilasters of
white marble, with beautiful acanthus decoration, which stood between
the double windows.</p>
<p>Outside the south-west wall of the nave was a row of small chambers
(tabernae), which, like it, were built of opus quadratum of tufa even in
the reconstruction of <date value="-14">14 B.C.</date> (or <date value="22">22 A.D.</date>). In three of them (one in the
centre and one near each end) were doors into the nave: the entire
difference in plan from the basilica Iulia may be due to the desire to
keep the heat out of the nave in summer. These chambers were vaulted
in concrete, the vault springing from a slight projection in the stone
block at the top of the side wall-an Augustan characteristic, noticeable
also in the basilica Iulia, the horrea Agrippiana, the temple of Castor
and Pollux, etc. A flight of stairs in the smaller chamber at each end
led to the space above them which opened on to the upper arcade of the
facade; and at the end of each of their side walls was a marble pilaster,
corresponding to the pillars which supported the main arcade, which had
fifteen arches. Most of the travertine foundation blocks of these pillars
are preserved, though some have been extracted by mediaeval and
Renaissance quarrying; but the white marble blocks of which they were
composed have been removed-with a single exception, which is of special
interest, inasmuch as it comes at the south angle of the building, and
shows clearly that here there was a projecting porch of one intercolumniation. This porch bore three inscriptions, set up in <date value="-2">2 B.C.</date> in honour of
Augustus and his two grandsons by the plebs, the senate, and the equites:
half of the first inscription is preserved (<bibl>CIL vi. 3747</bibl>=31291)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The attribution to Vespasian (<bibl>Mitt. 1888, 89</bibl>) has been given up.
</note>  but not
in situ, while the second lies as it fell when the building was destroyed
by earthquake. These inscriptions, with which have been connected
two bases also dedicated to Gaius and Lucius Caesar a year earlier
(DR 476-9 is not correct as to the circumstances of their discovery; see

<pb n="75"/>
<bibl>Mitt. 1899, 260</bibl>), have been used as the basis of the identification of the
front arcades of the basilica with the porticus Gai et Luci. Here lie
other fragments, including some of the entablature of the upper order of
the facade, with a cornice resembling that of the temple of Divus Iulius,
but smaller. The massive main order was Doric, with bucrania and
paterae alternating in the metopes, and fragments of it are preserved,
though up to 1500 a portion of the north-west side facade (which faced
originally on to the Argiletum, and owing to the direction of the latter,
was not at right angles to the front) was standing, as various
Renaissance drawings show (notably Sangallo, Barb. 26), and the so-called Coner, PBS ii. pl. 77).</p>
<p>From the facade three narrow steps descended to a broad landing,
from which four more steps led to the forum level. The shrine of <ref target="venus-cloacina" n="U">VENUS
CLOACINA</ref> (q.v.) was built at the foot of the steps, not far from the north-west end. The steps on the south-east side have recently been exposed
at one point, which has rendered it possible to determine the length
of the building.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century A.D.</dateRange> the wooden roofs of the nave
and aisles were set on fire (perhaps in 410, when Alaric captured Rome)
and numerous coins, from the time of Constantine to the <date value="399">end of the
fourth century</date>, were found on the marble pavement. Above the stratum
of ashes is a layer, about 1 metre thick, of earth mixed with fragments
of architecture, statues, bricks, pottery, etc.; and upon this stratum
has fallen the brick wall which replaced the back wall of the tabernae
after its destruction by fire. From this it is clear that the nave of the
basilica was abandoned after the fire (from which, as the fragments show,
the africano columns suffered especially) and was to a certain extent used
as a quarry even in ancient times. Nor were the tabernae nor the
facade rebuilt, though a large private building was established in the
south-east portion; in some of the tabernae are marble pavements of
the <dateRange from="600" to="899">seventh-ninth century</dateRange>, and on the back wall of the last taberna
but one, a fragment of an inscription, with the name of a saint, was
found. The sixteen columns of red granite (Ill. 11) which stood on high
'white marble pedestals (none of which were found in situ) may have
belonged to its portico. Certainly, the attribution of them to a restoration
of the facade of the basilica in the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> must be given up. Nor,
on the other hand, can they belong to the mediaeval church of S. Iohannes
in Campo (HCh 270), which must have lain at a much higher level,</p>
<p>The final ruin of the whole, which caused the collapse of the brick
wall at the back of the tabernae, may best be attributed to the earthquake
of Leo IV in <date value="847">847 A.D.</date> (<bibl>LPD ii. 108</bibl>; see VENUS ET ROMA, TEMPLUM).</p>

It was the last of the Roman basilicas, which it resembled less than it
did the halls of the great thermae. Its proper designation appears to

called templum Romae; <note anchored="true" place="foot">2 It was later called templum Romuli, while the temple of Venus and Rome was called
palatium Romuli; but the name never properly belonged to the so-called templum Divi
Romuli at all.
</note> (<bibl>LPD i. 280</bibl>; <bibl>Mel. 1886, 25</bibl> ff.; cf. however,
<bibl>BC 1900, 303</bibl>), and in the seventh when Pope Honorius took its bronze
tiles for the roof of St. Peter's (<bibl>LPD i. 323</bibl>; cf. <bibl>BC 1914, 106</bibl>). The
south aisle and the roof of the nave probably collapsed in the earth-
quake of Leo IV in 847 (<bibl>LPD ii. 108</bibl>); see <ref target="venus-et-roma-templum" n="U">VENUS ET ROMA, TEMPLUM</ref>).</p>
<p>The basilica stood on an enormous rectangular platform of concrete
100 metres long and 65 wide, and consisted of a central nave 80 metres
<pb n="77"/>
long, 25 wide and 35 high, with side aisles 16 metres wide and 24.50 high.
These aisles were divided into three sections by walls pierced by wide
arches and ending on each side of the nave in massive piers. In front of
these piers and at the corners of the nave were eight monolithic columns
of marble, all of which have been destroyed except one that was removed
by Paul V in 1613 to the Piazza di S. Maria Maggiore, where it now stands
(<bibl>LS ii. 209</bibl>; <bibl>JRS 1919, 180</bibl>). The height of the shaft of this column
is 14.50 metres, and it is 5.40 metres in circumference. On the piers
rested the roof of the nave, divided into three bays with quadripartite
groining. The ceiling was decorated with deep hexagonal and octagonal
coffers. For the entasis see Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. iv. 122</bibl>, 142.</p>
<p>The facade of the basilica as built by Maxentius was towards the east,
and at this end was a corridor or vestibule, 8 metres deep, which extended
across the whole width of the building. From this vestibule there were
five entrances into the basilica, three into the nave, and one into each of the
aisles. A flight of steps led up from the street in front to the vestibule,
which was adorned with columns. At the west end of the nave was a
semicircular apse, 20 metres in diameter, in which the fragments of the
colossal statue of Constantine, now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, were
probably found in 1487 (HC 242; Cons. 5, il ff.). The statue probably
sat in this apse, which would have been its natural place.</p>
<p>Constantine spoilt the original conception of the building when he
constructed a second entrance from the Sacra via in the middle of the
south side, where he built a porch with porphyry columns (?) and a long
flight of steps (Ill. 10). Opposite this new entrance he constructed a
second semicircular apse in the north wall, as large as that at the west end
of the nave but lower (PBS ii. pls. 16, 59; <bibl>CR 1905, 76</bibl>). Thenceforth
the basilica produced the same impression-of three parallel halls-whether one entered it from the south or from the east.</p>
<p>Besides the foundation, which has been almost wholly uncovered,
the north wall and the north aisle-or, as it rather appears, the north
sections of the three halls regarded as running north and south-are
still standing. The semicircular apse in the central hall contains sixteen
rectangular niches in two rows, with a pedestal or suggestus in the
centre.  A marble seat with steps runs round the apse, which was
separated from the rest of the hall by two columns and marble screens,
thus forming a sort of tribunal. Nothing of the nave remains except
the bases of the great piers. The core of the porch and of the flight of
steps leading down to the Sacra via is still visible, and several fragments
of the porphyry columns have been set up, but not in situ. Of the
pavement of slabs of marble considerable fragments have been found
(<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 117</bibl>).</p>
<p>The material employed in this basilica was brick-faced concrete
(<bibl>AJA 1912, 429-432</bibl>), and the great thickness of the walls-6 metres at
one point at the west end-and the enormous height and span of the
<pb n="78"/>
          
vaulted roof made it one of the most remarkable buildings in 
Rome.
The magnificence of its interior decoration was 
commensurate with its
size and imposing character. It was modelled on the central 
halls of the
great thermae.</p>
<p>The north-west corner of the basilica joined the wall of 
the forum
of Vespasian, thereby cutting off the previously existing 
thoroughfare
between the forum Romanum and the district of the 
Carinae. Maxentius
therefore constructed a passage-way under the north-west 
corner of the
building, about 4 metres wide and 15 long. In the Middle 
Ages this was
known as the Arco di Latrone <note anchored="true" place="foot">So Mon. <bibl>L. i. 551</bibl>; <bibl>ASRSP 1881, 378</bibl>. But the correct

restored by Diocletian (ib.), and again in <date value="416">416 A.D.</date> by a 
certain Gabinus
Vettius Probianus, prefect of the city, who also adorned it 
with statues
(<bibl>CIL vi. 1156</bibl>, 1658, 31883-31887; <bibl>NS 1883, 47-48</bibl>; 
<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 54</bibl>;
Klio, 1902, 269-270). Notwithstanding its dedication 
under the names
of Gaius and Lucius, it appears as the basilica Gai et Luci 
only in the
three passages quoted above, and elsewhere as basilica 
Iulia, or tecta Iulia
in the poets (<bibl>Mart. vi. 38</bibl>. 6; Stat. <bibl>Silv. i. 1</bibl>. 29). Its site is 
definitely
described by ancient authorities (Mon. Anc. loc. cit.; 
Fest. 290; Stat.
loc. cit.), and it is represented on the Marble Plan (frgs. 
20, 23). From its
roof Caligula threw coins among the people (Suet. Cal. 
37; <bibl>Joseph. xix.
11</bibl>.1. 11; cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1893, 264</bibl>; Chron. p. 145; <bibl>JRS 1926, 
134</bibl>).</p>
<p>During the early empire the centumviral court held its 
sessions in this
basilica (<bibl>Mart. vi. 38</bibl>. 5-6; Plin. <bibl>Ep. i. 5</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 14</bibl>; <bibl>v. 9</bibl>; <bibl>vi. 
33</bibl>; <bibl>Quint. xii.
5</bibl>. 6) and a statue of Crispus was set up here as a reward 
for his frequent
pleadings before the Emperor Domitian (Schol. Iuv. 4. 
81). The basilica
is mentioned in several inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 9709</bibl>, 9711, 
9712, 32296), in
Reg. (Reg. VIII), and by Pol. Silv. (545). The amount and 
magnificence
of the marble used in this basilica marked it as the special 
prey of the
vandals of the middle ages, and a lime kiln was found on 
its very pavement
(LD passim; <bibl>BC 1891, 229-236</bibl>). In the <dateRange from="600" to="699">seventh</dateRange> or <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth 
century,</dateRange> the
outer aisle on the west side was converted into a church 
(Archivio Storico
dell' Arte, 1896, 164; Frothingham, Monuments of 
Christian Rome
<bibl>(New York 1908)</bibl> 83); this has generally been identified 
with S. Maria
de Cannapara, mentioned in the catalogues of the twelfth 
to fifteenth
centuries, which must, however, have been at a 
considerably higher level
(HCh 321). Nor can it be S. Maria in Foro (HCh 335); cf. 
HFP 15.</p>
<p>The basilica occupied a space 101 metres long and 49 
wide, bounded
on all sides by streets, the Sacra via, the vicus Iugarius, 
the vicus Tuscus,
and a street on the south connecting the last two. In the 
later restora-
tions the material of construction, but not the form, was 
changed (<bibl>CR
1901, 136</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 60</bibl>). The central court, 82 metres 
long and 16
wide, was surrounded on all sides by two aisles, 7.50 
metres wide, over
which were the galleries of a second story (cf. Plin. <bibl>Ep. 
vi. 33</bibl> ; Suet. Cal.
37). These aisles were formed by the pillars of the facade, 
which were
of marble, and by inner rows of similar pillars made of 
brick and faced
with marble. The first floor of the basilica was therefore 
an open arcade,
divided by the marble balustrades which joined the pillars. 
Of these
pillars there were eighteen on each of the longer sides, and 
eight, counting
the ends of the spur walls, on the shorter. The entire 
outside of the
<pb n="80"/>
building was constructed originally of white marble, and on 
the outer
faces of its pillars were engaged columns of the Doric 
order. The floor
sloped slightly towards the north-east corner, and was 
paved with slabs
of marble, coloured in the central court and white in the 
aisles. The
central area was covered with a wooden roof (Stat. Silv. i. 
I. 29; <bibl>Mart.
vi. 38</bibl>. 6), which rose above the roof of the side aisles and 
admitted
light through its side windows, as in the basilica Aemilia. 
For the
fragments of the vaulting of the side aisles, see <bibl>Mitt. 1901, 
13-18</bibl>.</p>
<p>A continuous flight of three steps leads down from the 
floor of the
central court to that of the outer aisle in front, which, being 
lower, forms
a sort of portico. From this aisle steps again lead down to 
the street,
but as there is a considerable rise in the Sacra via, there are 
seven steps
at the east end and only one at the west. On the south side 
was a row
of rooms opening on the street, some of which, with 
massive tufa walls,
have only been partially excavated. It is possible that there 
was a row
of tabernae on this, the sunny side, as in the basilica 
Aemilia; there are
traces of stairs ascending to an upper level, i.e. to the roof 
of these
tabernae.</p>
<p>The existing remains consist of the foundation, with 
fragments of the
marble pavement on which are inscribed upwards of eighty 
tabulae
lusoriae (<bibl>Mitt. 1896, 227-252</bibl>); <note anchored="true" place="foot">This article, cited by various writers, contains a

the marble
casing; and on the vicus lugarius some of the brick pillars 
and arches of
the outer aisles belonging to the restoration of Diocletian, 
together with
some fragments of the marble pillars of the outside. 
Against the second
column from the front, on the west end, a heavy pier was 
built, which
formed part of an arch across the vicus Iugarius. Some 
architectural
fragments have been found, but the standing column of 
travertine and
many of the brick piers are modern (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 385-391;

but it was in the campus Martius, in circo Flaminio (Fast. 
Ven. ad III non.
Iun.; CIL i 2. p. 319; Mirabil. 23; <bibl>BC 1914, 383-385</bibl>), 
probably about
half-way between the north-east corner of the circus 
Flaminius and the

Petronia amnis. From  it the senators heard the cries of the 
prisoners
whom Sulla massacred in the Villa publica (Plut. Sulla 30; 
Sen. de clem.

front of it one
looked at the eastern end of the circus Flaminius (Ov. <bibl>Fast.

It was probably on the east side of the via Triumphalis and 
faced the east.
For a suggestive but hardly convincing theory that this 
temple was at
the west end of the circus Flaminius, in the Piazza

<p> (templa, Ov. <bibl>Fast. v. 153</bibl>): a temple of
Bona Dea at the north end of the eastern part of the 
Aventine, directly
south of the east end of the circus Maximus. It lay just 
below that section
of the hill called Saxum (v. <ref target="remoria" n="U">REMORIA</ref>), now occupied by 
the church of
S. Balbina, and hence was named Subsaxana (Ov. cit.; 
Not. Reg. XII;
Merlin 108-110; <bibl>BC 1914, 344-345</bibl>).  The early Roman 
goddess Bona
Dea Fauna (Macrob. <bibl>Sat. i. 12</bibl>. 22; Fest. 68) had 
apparently been merged
in the Greek goddess Dalia, whose cult had perhaps been 
introduced
into Rome after the capture of Tarentum, or a little later. To 
this
period the founding of the temple is probably to be 
assigned. It was
restored by Livia, the wife of Augustus (Ov. <bibl>Fast. v. 157</bibl>-
158), and by
Hadrian (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19), and was standing in the 
<dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>
(Not. Reg. XII), but has left no traces. The statement of 
Ovid (<bibl>Fast.
v. 155-156</bibl>) that this temple was dedicated by a Vestal, 
Claudia, is based
on an erroneous identification of this aedes with an 
aedicula which a
Vestal, Licinia, dedicated in <date value="-123">123 B.C.</date>, and which evidently 
was not allowed
to stand (Cic. pro domo 136). Bona Dea (Damia) was a 
goddess of
healing and her temple a centre of healing, as is shown by 
the fact that
in this temple snakes moved about unharmed and 
innocuous, and there
was a store within it of herbs of every sort '<foreign xml:lang="la">ex quibus 
antistites dant
plerumque medicinas</foreign>' (Macrob. <bibl>Sat. i. 12</bibl>. 25-26). No men

Rome, stretching
west from the eastern plateau, from its junction with the 
Esquiline
near the Porta Maggiore, in an irregular tongue about 2 
kilometres long
and 400 to 500 metres wide. This tongue ends in two 
points, like pro-
montories, an eastern, probably called <ref target="caeliolus" n="U">CAELIOLUS</ref> (q.v.), 
where the
church of the SS. Quattro Coronati now stands, and a 
western, the site of
SS. Giovanni e Paolo. South of the Caelian is the valley

the brook now called the Marrana, part of which was the 
<ref target="camenae" n="U">VALLIS CAMENARUM</ref> (q.v.), and on the north it was separated from 
the Esquiline
by the low ground that runs east from  the Colosseum.  
Part of the
northern side of the Caelian seems to have been called 
<ref target="succusa" n="U">SUCUSA</ref> (q.v.),
and this was probably just east of the Caeliolus. The height 
of the
Caelian varies considerably, being 45 metres in the Villa 
Mattei and 54
in the Villa Wolkonsky.</p>
<p>The hill is said to have been called at first <ref target="querquetulanus-mons" n="U">MONS 
QUERQUETULANUS</ref>
(q.v.), from the oak groves that covered it (Tac. <bibl>Ann. iv. 
65</bibl>), but this
was perhaps an invention of the antiquarians to explain the 
<ref target="porta-querquetulana" n="U">PORTA
QUERQUETULANA</ref> (q.v.) of the Servian wall. In the 
reign of Tiberius
the senate voted to call the hill Augustus mons (Tac. <bibl>Ann. 
iv. 64</bibl>; Suet.
Tib. 48), but this name never came into general use. In the 
Regionary
Catalogues the <rs key="regio2" type="region">second region</rs> of the city is called 
<ref target="caelimontium" n="U">CAELIMONTIUM</ref> (q.v.).
Caelius itself was explained by the antiquarians as the 
name given to this
hill in consequence of the settlement upon it of Caeles 
Vibenna and his
Etruscan companions who came to the assistance of one 
of the Roman
kings (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 46</bibl>; Fest. 44, 355; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 36</bibl>; <bibl>CIL 
xiii. 1668</bibl>,
1. 21). It seems difficult to explain the existence of Caelius 
mons and
Caelius, the name of a well-known plebeian gens, unless 
there be some
connection between the two (<bibl>Jord. i. 1</bibl>. 186-188; see 
<ref target="septimontium" n="U">SEPTIMONTIUM</ref>).</p>
<p>Tradition varies in ascribing the addition of the Caelius 
to the city
to Romulus (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 46</bibl>), Tullus Hostilius (<bibl>Liv. i. 30</bibl>. 
33; de vir. ill. 4;
Dionys. iii. I), Ancus Marcius (Cic. de rep. ii. 18; <bibl>Strabo 
v. 234</bibl>), Tar-
quinius Priscus (Tac. <bibl>Ann. iv. 65</bibl>), and Servius Tullius 
(or. Claudii, <bibl>CIL xiii.
1668</bibl>), and is of course without value.</p>
<p>Both Caelius and Sucusa were included in the 
Septimontium (cf. Fest.
341, 348). The later 'Servian' wall, following undoubtedly 
the original
line, crossed the Caelius about 250 metres west of the 
present church of
S. Giovanni in Laterano, and thus included the western 
half of the hill
within the area of the city, a condition that probably went 
back to the
regal period. Whether this hill ever had its own 
fortifications is still
undecided (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1871, 47</bibl>; cf. Varro, loc. cit.; 
Jord. i. I. 206;
HJ 224).
<pb n="89"/></p>
<p>In Augustus' division of the city, the Caelian fell into 
three regions-
the western and southern slopes into <rs key="regio1" type="region">Region I</rs>, the main 
portion into <rs key="regio2" type="region">II</rs>,
and the extreme eastern part into <rs key="regio5" type="region">V</rs>. The hill was thickly

during the republic, and we are told of an apartment 
house, belonging
to Ti. Claudius Centumalus (Cic. de off. iii. 66), which the 
owner was
ordered to demolish because it was so high as to cut off 
the view of the
augurs. In <date value="27">27 A.D.</date> the hill suffered severely from a fire 
(Tac. <bibl>Ann. iv. 64</bibl>),
and afterwards became a favourite place for the 
residences of the rich,
which, with their gardens, seem to have occupied a 
considerable part of
the whole (for the topography and monuments of the

<p>originally fountain deities, afterwards

was located.
Topographically, Camenae was a general term  (<bibl>Vitr. viii.

ii. 6</bibl>. 16; Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. vii. 697</bibl>; cf. templa Camenarum,

the grove (lucus,
Iuv. loc. cit.; <bibl>Liv. i. 21</bibl>), the spring (fons, locc. citt.; Plut. 
Num. 4;
Symmach. <bibl>Ep. i. 20</bibl>), and the shrine (aedicula, Serv. loc. 
cit.). The spring
was undoubtedly at the foot of the southern extremity of 
the Caelian
hill, inside the boundaries of the Villa Mattei, but it is 
impossible to
identify it certainly with any particular one of those that 
are now found
in the immediate vicinity (cf. LA 223-225 ; <bibl>LS iii. 205</bibl> ; 
HJ 206).  The
grove was around the spring, and the vallis extended 
north-east from
this point along the south-east side of the Caelian, and 
was traversed
by the vicus Camenarum  (<bibl>CIL vi. 975</bibl>, Reg. I), which 
joined the via
Appia. This valley is now marked by the Via delle Mole 
and the Marrana
brook. The spring was near the via Appia, and, according 
to tradition,
Numa built beside it a small bronze aedicula (the day of 
dedication was
Aug. 13, Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 108</bibl>), which, after 
having been struck
by lightning and removed to the temple of Honos et 
Virtus, was again
transferred by Fulvius Nobilior to the temple of Hercules 
which was then
called aedes Herculis et Musarum. Later a temple (aedes, 
Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxiv. 19</bibl>) appears to have taken its place, which is 
mentioned only once.
The grotto of the spring had also been adorned with 
marble in Juvenal's
<pb n="90"/>
time (iii. 10). Its water was excellent (Vitr. cit.; Frontin. de 
aquis i. 4).

<p>the level ground between the slopes 
of the Capitoline,
the Quirinal, and the Pincian hills, and the Tiber. This 
term varied
somewhat in its signification; for, while originally and in 
its widest
sense it embraced all this district, other names for small 
sections seem
to have come into use later. Thus as early as the <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth 
century B.C.</dateRange> the
south portion of the plain was probably known as <ref target="prata-flaminia" n="U">PRATA 
FLAMINIA</ref> (q.v.,
<bibl>Liv. iii. 54</bibl>, 63), and campus Martius was the ordinary 
designation of
what lay beyond. After Augustus had divided the city into 
fourteen
regions, the name campus Martius was restricted to that 
portion of
<rs key="regio9" type="region">Region IX</rs> (circus Flaminius) which lay west of the via 
Lata, the modern
Corso; and here again there seems to have been a further 
distinction,
for a cippus (<bibl>CIL vi. 874</bibl>) found near the Pantheon 
indicates that the
campus Martius of the time of Augustus was divided into 
two parts-
the district between the cippus and the circus Flaminius, 
which had been
more or less built over, and the open meadow to the 
north, the campus
proper; cf. ib. 31189; <bibl>BC 1883, 11-12</bibl>.</p>
<p>The campus Martius covered an area of about 250 
hectares (600 acres),
extending a little more than two kilometres north and 
south from the
Capitoline to the porta Flaminia, and a little less than two 
kilometres
<pb n="92"/>
east and west in its widest part, between the Quirinal and 
the river.
It was low, from 10 to 15 metres above the level of the 
sea in antiquity
(13 to 20 now), and from 3 to 8 above that of the Tiber, 
and of course
subject to frequent inundations. It contained several 
swamps or ponds,
as well as streams, the largest of which, the <ref target="petronia-amnis" n="U">PETRONIA 
AMNIS</ref> (q.v.),
which formed the limit of the city auspices (<bibl>AR  1909, 
67-70</bibl>) came
from a spring on the Quirinal, called the Cati fons, and 
flowed into the
largest swamp, the palus Caprae or Capreae, where were 
afterwards the
pool and baths of Agrippa. In the north-west part of the 
campus, near
the great bend in the river, there were hot springs, 
probably sulphurous,
and other traces of volcanic action. Some small part at 
least was wooded,
for we know of two groves, <ref target="aesculetum" n="U">AESCULETUM</ref> and <ref target="aesculetum" n="U">LUCUS 
PETELINUS</ref> (qq.v.).</p>
<p>The campus Martius, frequently called campus alone 
(<bibl>Liv. xl. 52</bibl>. 4; Cic.
Cat. ii. I. I; <bibl>Iuv. ii. 132</bibl>; Hor. <bibl>Carm. iii. 1</bibl>. 11; Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 
860</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 519</bibl>),
derived its name from the cult of Mars, or from the fact 
that it was
consecrated to Mars. According to one form  of the 
tradition it was
private property of the Tarquins, and after their expulsion 
became state
land, and was dedicated to Mars (<bibl>Liv. ii. 5</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">ager 
Tarquiniorum qui inter
urbem ac Tiberim fuit consecratus Marti Martius deinde 
campus fuit</foreign>;
<bibl>Flor. i. 9</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">populus Romanus agrum Marti suo consecrat</foreign>; 
Schol. <bibl>Iuv.
i. 132</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">hic enim ager Tarquini superbi fuit et pro illius fuga

d' *)arei/ou pedi/ou to\
h(/diston e)ke/kthto *tarku/nios kai\ tou=to tw=| qew=| 
kaqie/rwsav</foreign>); according to
another (<bibl>Dionys. v. 13</bibl>), it had been consecrated to Mars 
at an earlier period
and afterwards appropriated by Tarquin. This view is 
supported by the
existence of an <ref target="mars-ara" n="U">ARA MARTIS</ref> (q.v.), situated probably 
east of the Pantheon
in the Via del Seminario (<bibl>CP 1908, 65-73</bibl>), which, 
according to Festus
(189; cf. Plut. Marcell. 8), was mentioned in a law of 
Numa and therefore
dated from the early regal period. The note of Servius 
(<bibl>Aen. ix. 272</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">mos fuerat ut viris fortibus sive regibus pro honore 
daretur aliqua publici
agri particula ut habuit Tarquinius Superbus in campo 
Martio</foreign>) may be
reconciled with either form of this tradition, but the first 
was probably
the more generally accepted.</p>
<p>Another tradition concerning the public ownership of 
part or all of
this district is apparently embodied in certain references 
to the gift of
a <ref target="campus-tiberinus" n="U">CAMPUS TIBERINUS</ref> (q.v.) or Martius to the state by 
a Vestal virgin,
Gaia Taracia or Fufetia (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 25</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">invenitur 
statua decreta
et Taraciae Gaiae sive Fufetiae virgini Vestali ut poneretur 
ubi vellet...
meritum  eius ipsis ponam  annalium  verbis: quod 
campum Tiberinum
gratificata esset ea populo</foreign>; Plut. Popl. 8; cf. HJ 475; <bibl>Gell. 
vii. 7</bibl>. 4).
As Gellius alone identifies campus Tiberinus and campus 
Martius, much
uncertainty is attached to the whole matter (<bibl>Gilb. ii. 112</bibl>-
113; <bibl>RE vii.
480-483</bibl>; Mommsen, <bibl>RF ii. 7-8</bibl>; Mitt. 1921-2, 23-28).</p>
<p>At any rate the campus belonged to the state from the 
beginning of
the republic, and we are told (<bibl>Oros. v. 18</bibl>. 27) that Sulla, 
under the financial
<pb n="93"/>
pressure of the impending war with Mithridates, was the 
first to sell any
part of this public domain to private owners, although the 
name prata
Flaminia (vid. sup.) seems to indicate some private 
ownership at a very
early date. It is probable, however, that these prata had 
become public
property but retained their original name. There are 
further indications
of the encroachment by individuals on the boundaries of 
the campus in
the first or possibly the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange>, such as the 
suburb called
<ref target="aemiliana" n="U">AEMILIANA</ref> (q.v.), just outside the porta Carmentalis, 
and perhaps a
villa and gardens of the elder Scipio (Cic. de nat. deor. ii. 
11; <bibl>Phil. ii. 109</bibl>;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi. 1</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">e)s to\ proa/teion a)pa/nthsas</foreign>).  
Private houses did
not begin to multiply to any extent (cf. Cic. ad <bibl>Att. xiii. 
33</bibl>) before the
time of the empire, but they became fairly numerous, for 
the Regionary
Catalogue lists 2777 insulae and 140 domus in <rs key="regio9" type="region">Region IX</rs>.</p>
<p>From  the beginning the campus Martius was used as 
pasture for
sheep (Schol. <bibl>Iuv. vi. 528</bibl>) and horses (<bibl>Dionys. v. 13</bibl>); 
was cultivated
for grain (cf. the story of Tarquin's grain); and furnished 
space for the
athletic and military exercises of the Roman youth 
(Dionys. loc. cit.;
Hor. <bibl>Carm. iii. 7</bibl>. 25-27; Veget. de re mil. i. 10). It was 
entirely outside
the pomerium  during the republic and probably remained 
so down
to the reign of Claudius (see <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref>). By the time of 
Hadrian
the pomerium had been extended to include the prata 
Flaminia, but the
campus Martius in its narrower sense was not included 
until the wall
of Aurelian was built. Because it was public property and 
outside the
pomerium, the campus was used as the place of assembly 
for the citizens
(<bibl>Liv. i. 44</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. iv. 22</bibl>; <bibl>Gell. xv. 27</bibl>), in their military 
capacity as
an army and in their civil capacity as the comitia 
centuriata.  The
enclosed space in which this comitia voted came to be 
known as ovile
or saepta (q.v.; Serv. <bibl>Ecl. i. 33</bibl> et al.). Audience was 
given here to foreign
ambassadors who could not enter the city (<bibl>Liv. xxx. 21</bibl>. 
12 ; <bibl>xxxiii. 24</bibl>. 5),
and foreign cults were domiciled in temples erected here.</p>
<p>We know certainly of only three other cult centres 
besides that of
Mars in the campus Martius before the Punic wars-the 
<foreign xml:lang="la">ara Ditis et
Proserpinae in Tarento</foreign>, the Apollinare, an altar or grove, 
and the temple
of Apollo which was built in <date value="-431">431 B.C.</date>, and the temple of 
Bellona built in <date value="-296">296</date> B.C. Between <date value="-231">231</date> and the battle of Actium  at least 
fifteen other
temples were erected, and more during the next century. 
The construction of the circus Flaminius in <date value="-221">221</date> B.C. marked an epoch 
in the history
of the southern part of the campus, but there was no 
public building
of any note in the campus Martius proper before the end 
of the republic,
when Pompeius built the first stone theatre in Rome in <date value="-55">55</date> 
B.C.  Caesar
conceived the idea of changing the course of the Tiber by 
digging a
new channel on the west of the Janiculum, and of building 
over all the
plain between that hill and those on the east side of the 
city (Cic. ad <bibl>Att.
xiii. 33</bibl>). The river bed was not changed; but Augustus 
and his
coadjutors began the construction of all kinds of public 
buildings, with
<pb n="93"/>
the result that, by the time of the Antonines, all of this 
district except
the north-west section, which was still kept open, was 
covered with many
of the most wonderful structures in Rome, circuses, 
theatres, porticoes,
baths, columns, obelisks, mausolea, temples, etc. The 
remarkable
appearance of the campus even before the death of 
Augustus is described
by Strabo in a well-known passage (v. 3. 8, p. 236), 
where, however,
the traditional text requires rearrangement (A. W. Buren, 
Ann. Brit.
Sch. at Athens, xxii. 1916-18, 48-50, following P. Meyer, 
Straboniana, 20).</p>
<p>There is some doubt as to whether the murder of 
Valentinian III in
<date value="455">455 A.D.</date> occurred in the Campus Martius proper, or in the 
campus Martius,
or drill ground (the words are frequently used in this sense 
nowadays
both in France and in Italy) attached to the imperial villa '<foreign xml:lang="la">ad 
duas
lauros</foreign>,' beyond the third milestone of the via Labicana 
(Johannes Ant.
fr. 85, p. 126; Chron. <bibl>Min. i. 162</bibl>, 303, 490; <bibl>ii. 86</bibl>, 157, 
186; <bibl>iii. 422</bibl>).
In the former case, we should have to suppose the 
existence in the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth
century A.D.</dateRange> of another locality in the campus Martius, 
bearing the
same name '<foreign xml:lang="la">ad duas lauros,</foreign>' and the latter appears to be 
preferable
(<bibl>BCr 1879, 76</bibl>; Studi e Documenti xvii. <bibl>(1896)</bibl>, 47, 48; <bibl>BC 1906, 74-77</bibl>; T x. 390; Mem. <bibl>AP i. 3</bibl> <bibl>(1927)</bibl> 158; contrast Bury, 
History of
the Later Roman Empire, i. 300).</p>
<p>With the decline of the city after the barbarian 
invasions, the rapidly
dwindling population gradually abandoned the surrounding 
hills and was
concentrated in the campus Martius, which contained the 
main part of
Rome until the new developments in the <dateRange from="1800" to="1899">nineteenth

</head> 
<p>* the smallest of the hills of Rome, 
with a length of
about 460 metres and an average width of 180, lying 
between the forum
and the campus Martius and extending in a general north-
east-south-
west direction. It was surrounded by steep cliffs on all 
sides except the
south-east, where it was accessible from  the forum  
valley, and was
composed of three distinct parts, the elevations at the 
north and south
<pb n="96"/>
ends and the depression between them.  The present 
height of the
north sumqit at the church of S. Maria in Aracoeli is 39 
metres above the
mean level of the Tiber; that of the south summit, the Via 
di Monte
Tarpeo, 38 metres; and that of the Piazza del 
Campidoglio, 30 metres.</p>
<p>In the earliest period the north elevation seems to have 
belonged to
the Sabine settlement on the Quirinal.  Possibly the south  
portion
came into possession of the Palatine Romans, but at any 
rate the whole
hill became part of the enlarged city at the stage known as 
the City of
the Four Regions, when the Romans and Sabines had 
united, although
it was not included in one of the regions themselves.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Beloch (Rom. Gesch. 204,205) expresses considerable 
scepticism as to the existence
of a Sabine settlement on the Quirinal. In any case the 
division of the Capitol between
two different communities is not easy to imagine.</note> This 
seems to have
indicated that it belonged to the community as a whole.  
Originally
the north summit-and presumably the south-was fortified 
in the usual
way by escarpments and breastwork where the cliff was 
steep, and
elsewhere by tufa walls, some traces of which have been 
found (see <ref target="arx" n="U">ARX</ref>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Except those in Via S. Pietro in Carcere I, the antiquity 
of which (despite ZA) is
doubtful, these walls probably belong to the 'Servian' 
enceinte and not to. any separate
fortifications of the Capitol and in part also to the 
"substructiones Capitolii" (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxvi. 104</bibl>).
</note>
When the Palatine and Sabine settlements were united, the 
wall of the
enlarged city included the whole hill and ran along its 
north-east side,
the line of the later so-called <ref target="murus-servii-tullii" n="U">MURUS SERVII TULLII</ref> 
(q.v.). Traces of the
latter have been found at some points (see <ref target="arx" n="U">ARX</ref>).</p>
<p>On the north elevation was the <ref target="arx" n="U">ARX</ref> (q.v.), or citadel, 
and on the south
Tarquin established the worship of the triad of great 
gods-Jupiter,
Juno and Minerva-thereby marking this point as the 
religious centre
of the community (<bibl>Gilb. ii. 448-456</bibl>). To it was given the 
name Capitolium
(caput, capitalis), which the Roman antiquarians 
explained by a story
that in digging for the foundations of the great temple of 
Jupiter, the
workmen found a human skull of great size which was 
regarded as
prophetic of the future greatness of the city (<bibl>Liv. i. 55</bibl>; 
Varro, <bibl>LL v. 41</bibl>).
Capitolium, therefore, was originally the proper 
designation of this part
of the hill, and continued to be so used (Cic. pro Scaur. 
47 ; Varro, <bibl>LL
v. 149</bibl>; Verg. <bibl>Aen. ix. 448</bibl>; Hor. <bibl>Carm. iii. 30</bibl>. 8; <bibl>Liv. iii. 
18</bibl>. 10; Plin.
<bibl>NH xix. 23</bibl>; Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 3</bibl>; and very freq.). The official 
designation of the hill was Arx et Capitolium (<bibl>Liv. ii. 7</bibl>. 10; <bibl>iii. 
68</bibl>. 7; <bibl>Gell.
v. 12</bibl>. 2; <bibl>Liv. iii. 18</bibl>. 1 : arce Capitolioque; <bibl>iii. 19</bibl>. 7: in 
arce in Capitolio;
<bibl>vi. 20</bibl>. 13: arce aut Capitolio; Val. <bibl>Max. vi. 3</bibl>. 1 : in arce 
aut in Capitolio)
or Capitolium  et Arx with variations (Cic. pro Rab. 35; 
<bibl>Liv. i. 33</bibl>. 2;
vi. II. 4; <bibl>xxxviii. 51</bibl>. 8; Val. <bibl>Max. iii. 2</bibl>. 7; Tac. <bibl>Ann. xi. 
23</bibl>), which
indicated its double nature and continued in use down to 
the end of the
republic, although the increasing importance of the 
Capitolium and the
decreasing necessity for a citadel led to the gradual 
application of the
term Capitolium to the entire hill (CIL i 2. p. 191, 6, 198. 
18; Cic. pro
Font. 30; <bibl>Liv. iii. 19</bibl>. 12; Val. Max. i. I. II; Serv. <bibl>Aen. i. 
720</bibl>; Suet.
<pb n="97"/>
Tib. 3; <bibl>Gell. xvii. 21</bibl>. 24; and freq.). On the other hand, 
the word
Capitolium was also employed to designate simply the 
temple of Jupiter
itself, as the most significant part of the whole (Cic. de 
orat. iii. 180;
<bibl>Vitr. iii. 3</bibl>. 5; Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 182</bibl>; <bibl>Vell. ii. 3</bibl>. I; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 
71</bibl>; and
freq.). The adjective Capitolinus was of course derived 
from the noun,
and mons Capitolinus became a common name for the 
whole hill (ad <bibl>Her.
iv. 43</bibl>; Fest. 322; <bibl>Solin. i. 12</bibl>; <bibl>iv. 13</bibl>; Flor. <bibl>Ep. i. 11</bibl>, 13;

de civ. ii. 22;
<bibl>iii. 8</bibl>, 12; <bibl>iv. 23</bibl>). The depression between the two 
summits was called
<ref target="inter-duos-lucos-2" n="U">INTER DUOS LUCOS</ref> (q.v.) or <ref target="inter-duos-lucos-2" n="U">ASYLUM</ref> (q.v.), the latter 
name being explained
by the story that Romulus welcomed here the refugees 
from other towns
(<bibl>Liv. i. 8</bibl>).  The precipitous cliff at the south-west corner 
of the
Capitolium, from which criminals convicted of capital 
offences were
hurled, was known from early times as saxum Tarpeium 
(Varro, <bibl>LL v. 41</bibl>)
or rupes Tarpeia (Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 71</bibl>), and both the whole 
hill and its southern
part were called <ref target="tarpeius-mons" n="U">TARPEIUS MONS</ref> (q.v.), but the 
statement of the Roman
antiquarians that this was the original name of the hill is 
false. It was
also called Saturnius: cf. Varro, <bibl>LL v. 42</bibl> (antiquum 
oppidum in hoc
fuisse Saturnia scribitur); Fest. 322; <bibl>Solin. i. 13</bibl>.</p>
<p>The principal approach to both summits of this hill was 
the <ref target="clivus-capitolinus" n="U">CLIVUS
CAPITOLINUS</ref> (q.v.), originally a path leading from the 
forum to the
depression between the summits, where it divided; but the 
erection of the
<ref target="tabularium" n="U">TABULARIUM</ref> (q.v.) at the end of the republic, and of 
the mediaeval
buildings, destroyed all traces of earlier conditions on the 
ridge between
the elevations. There were also two flights of steps, the 
<ref target="centum-gradus" n="U">CENTUM GRADUS</ref>
and (perhaps) the <ref target="gradus-monetae" n="U">GRADUS MONETAE</ref> (qq.v.), which 
led to the top of the
hill from the forum side.</p>
<p>The Capitolium proper, or south summit, was occupied 
by the most
famous of all Roman temples, that of <ref target="iuppiter-optimus-maximus-capitolinus-aedes" n="U">IUPPITER OPTIMUS MAXIMUS CAPITOLINUS </ref>(q.v.), and the <ref target="area-capitolina" n="U">AREA CAPITOLINA</ref> 
(q.v.) or space in which
this temple and others stood; while on the north summit 
were the Arx
and temple of <ref target="iuno-moneta-aedes" n="U">IUNO MONETA</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>During the first centuries of the republic, private 
dwellings were
erected to some extent on the hill, for in the year <date value="-390">390</date> 
B.C. there was a
guild of those who dwelt <foreign xml:lang="la">in Capitolio atque arce </foreign>(<bibl>Liv. v. 
50</bibl>); and after
the treason of Manlius, a law was passed which forbade 
any patrician
to live on either summit (<bibl>Liv. vi. 20</bibl>). In spite of such 
prohibitions, the
gradual destruction of the fortifications and the demands 
of a rapidly
increasing population led to continual encroachments upon 
this quasi-
sacred hill. In <date value="-93">93 B.C.</date> a considerable tract, which had 
belonged to the
priests, was sold and came into private possession (<bibl>Oros. 
v. 18</bibl>; cf. also
Cic. pro Mil. 64). By the <date value="50">middle of the first century</date> the 
whole hill, with
the exception of the area Capitolina, the actual sites of the 
temples, and
the steepest parts of the slopes, was occupied by private 
houses (Tac.
<pb n="98"/>
<bibl>Hist. iii. 71</bibl>; cf. Hist. Aug. Elag. 30). Remains of these 
houses have
been found on the Arx near the church of S. Maria in 
Aracoeli, and at
the foot of the stairway leading from the Piazza d'Aracoeli 
to the
church (<bibl>NS 1888, 497</bibl>; <bibl>1889, 68</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 255</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1873, 111-122</bibl>, 143-146; <bibl>1888, 331</bibl>; see also Acciaresi, Giuseppe Sacconi

<p>It was used simply as a place of detention, and not of 
penal servitude,
though executions (i.e. those of Jugurtha and 
Vercingetorix and of the
Catilinarian conspirators) also took place here. The 
subterranean part
was called Tullianum (applied in Amm. <bibl>Marc. xxviii. 1</bibl>. 
57 to the whole).
The name (<bibl>Liv. xxix. 22</bibl>. 10; <bibl>xxxiv. 44</bibl>. 8; Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. 
vi. 573</bibl>; Calpurn.
Flacc. decl. 4: Acta Chrysanth. et Dariae, 25 Oct. p. 483) 
is by Varro
(<bibl>LL v. 151</bibl>) and Festus (356) derived from  Servius 
Tullius, who was
the builder of this portion of the carcer : while Livy (i. 
33) attributes the
construction of the carcer to Ancus Martius. Sallust 
(Cat. 55) describes
it in a well-known passage: <foreign xml:lang="la">in carcere locus quod 
Tullianum appellatur,
ubi paullulum  ascenderis ad laevam, circa duodecim  
pedes humi depressus. Eum muniunt undique parietes atque insuper 
camera lapideis
fornicibus iuncta, sed incultu, tenebris, odore foeda atque 
terribilis eius
facies est.</foreign></p>
<p>This lower chamber of the building is subterranean and 
was originally
accessible only by a hole in the roof.  It is nearly 7 
metres in diameter:
in the walls only three courses of stone are visible, and it 
is thus less
than 6 feet high: but three more courses may still be 
hidden by the
present floor, and this would give the 12 feet of which 
Sallust speaks.
The building was, according to one theory, in origin a 
cupola grave, like
those of Mycenae: while others think that it served as a 
water reservoir,
and derive the name Tullianum from  tullus, a spring. A 
small spring
does indeed still rise in the floor; and the absence of 
incrustation, used
as an argument against the second hypothesis, has little 
weight, as the
water is not calcareous.</p>
<p>It has generally been believed that the cupola was cut 
by the constructors of the upper chamber; Tenney Frank (TF 39-
47) now supposes,
without sufficient reason, that the lower chamber 
originally had a flat
wooden roof, which later served as a scaffolding for the 
flat stone vault,
which dates from  after <date value="-100">100 B.C.</date> But the holes to which 
he points in
support of this theory may just as well have been cut for 
this scaffolding.
<pb n="100"/>
There is little doubt that the chamber was originally 
circular (the statement that the straight chord on the side towards the 
Comitium is of rock,
is incorrect). See <bibl>JRS 1925, 121</bibl>.</p>
<p>Most authorities attribute to it a high antiquity: but 
Frank assigns
the lower chamber to the <dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third century B.C.</dateRange> owing to the 
use of peperino
(not tufa, as all other authorities state) and the regularity 
of the blocks,
uniformly 56 cm. high: while the date of the drain leading

<p>This temple was restored in <date value="-117">117 B.C.</date> by L. Caecilius 
Metellus (Cic. pro

repairs were made by Verres (Cie. in <bibl>Verr. i. 129-154</bibl>), 
and the temple
was completely rebuilt by Tiberius in <date value="6">6 A.D.</date>, and 
dedicated in his own
name and that of his brother Drusus (Suet. Tib. 20; Cass. 
<bibl>Dio lv. 27</bibl>. 4;
Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 707-708</bibl>). Caligula incorporated the temple in 
his palace,
making it the vestibule (Suet. Cal. 22; Cass. <bibl>Dio lix. 28</bibl>. 
5; cf. <ref target="augustus-divus-templum" n="U">DIVUS
AUGUSTUS, TEMPLUM</ref>, <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS  TIBERIANA</ref>), but 
this  condition  was
changed by Claudius.  Another restoration is attributed to 
Domitian
(Chron. 146), and in this source the temple is called 
<foreign xml:lang="la">templum Castoris
et Minervae</foreign>, a name  also  found  in  the  Notitia  (Reg. 
VIII), and
variously explained (see <ref target="minerva-templum" n="U">MINERVA, TEMPLUM</ref>). It had 
also been supposed
that there was restoration by Trajan or Hadrian (HC 161), 
and that the
existing remains of columns and entablature date from 
that period, but
there is no evidence for this assumption, and the view 
has now been
abandoned (Toeb. 51).  The existing remains are mostly 
of the Augustan
period (<bibl>AJA 1912, 393</bibl>), and any later restorations must 
have been so
superficial as to leave no traces.</p>
<p>This temple served frequently as a meeting-place for 
the senate (Cic. in
<bibl>Verr. i. 129</bibl>; Hist. Aug. Maxim. 16; Valer. 5; CIL i 2. 586. 
1), and played
a conspicuous role in the political struggles that centred in 
the forum
(Cic. de har. resp. 27; de domo 54, 110; pro Sest. 34; in 
Pis. 11, 23;
pro Mil. 18; ad Q. fr. ii. 3. 6; App. <bibl>BC i. 25</bibl>), its steps 
forming a
sort of second Rostra (Plut. Sulla 33; Cic. <bibl>Phil. iii. 27</bibl>). In 
it were
kept the standards of weights and measures (<bibl>CIL v. 
8119</bibl>. 4; <bibl>xi. 6726</bibl>. 2;
<bibl>xiii. 10030</bibl>. 13 ff.; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1881, 182</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 
244-245</bibl>), and the
chambers in the podium (see below) seem to have served 
as safe deposit
vaults for the imperial fiscus (<bibl>CIL vi. 8688</bibl>, 8689),<note anchored="true" place="foot">8688 '<foreign xml:lang="la">actori Caesaris ad Castor. et ad loricata(m)</foreign> ' seems 
to allude to two separate
buildings; and the latter is mentioned alone (' a loricata ') in 
ib. 8690-2 (=xv. 7143-7145).
Mommsen (CIL in loc.) believes this 'loricata' to be a 
building defended by a lorica
(i.e. a kind of government safe deposit); contrast <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>.

for the treasures
of private individuals (Cic. pro Quinct.   7; <bibl>Iuv. xiv. 260</bibl>-

temple, artistic
<pb n="104"/>
                             
or historical, except of one bronze tablet which was a 
memorial of
the granting of citizenship to the Equites Campani in <date value="-340">340</date> 
B.C. (Liv. viii.
II. 16).</p>
<p>The traces of the earlier structures (including some 
opus quadratum
belonging to the original temple ; see Ill. 12) indicate 
successive enlargements with some changes in the plan of cella and pronaos 
(for the discussion
of these changes and the history of the temple, see Van 
Buren, <bibl>CR 1906,
77-82</bibl>, 184, who also thinks that traces can be found of a 
restoration in
the <dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third century B.C.</dateRange> ; cf. however, <bibl>AJA 1912, 244-246</bibl>). 
The Augustan
temple was Corinthian, octastyle and peripteral, with 
eleven columns on
each side, and a double row on each side of the pronaos. 
This pronaos
was 9.90 metres by 15.80, the cella 16 by 19.70, and the 
whole building
about 50 metres long by 30 wide. The floor was about 7 
metres above
the Sacra via.  The very lofty podium  consisted of a 
concrete core
enclosed in tufa walls, from which projected short spur 
walls. On these
stood the columns, but directly beneath them at the points 
of heaviest
pressure travertine was substituted for tufa. Between these 
spur walls
were chambers in the podium, opening outward and 
closed by metal
doors. From  the pronaos a flight of eleven steps, 
extending nearly
across the whole width of the temple, led down to a wide 
platform,
3.66 metres above the area in front. This was provided 
with a railing
and formed a high and safe place from which to address 
the people.
From the frequent references in literature (see above) it is 
evident that
there was a similar arrangement in the earlier temple of 
Metellus. Leading
from this platform to the ground were two narrow 
staircases, at the ends
and not in front. The podium was covered with marble 
and decorated
with two cornices, one at the top and another just above 
the metal doors
of the strong chambers. Of the superstructure three 
columns on the
east side are standing, which are regarded as perhaps the 
finest architectural remains in Rome. They are of white marble, 
fluted, 12.50 metres
in height and 1.45 in diameter. The entablature, 3.75 
metres high, has
a plain frieze and an admirable worked cornice (for the 
complete description of the remains of the imperial temple previous to

<p> the barracks of the 
equites singulares, a
select corps of cavalry organised about the <date value="99">end of the first 
century</date> as a
bodyguard for the emperor. Some remains of these 
barracks were found
in 1885 in the Via Tasso, just north-west of the Scala 
Santa, consisting
principally of the wall of a large rectangular court, in which 
were niches
and in front of the niches inscribed pedestals (<bibl>BC 1885, 137</bibl>; Ann. d.
<bibl>Inst. 1885, 235</bibl> ; PT 131). These inscriptions and others 
found near by
(<bibl>CIL vi. 31138-31187</bibl>) mention castra priora and castra 
nova or nova
Severiana, and one MS. of the Notitia reads castra eq. 
sing. 11. There
were, therefore, two barracks, the later apparently erected 
by Severus,
but they were probably adjacent structures, or even parts 
of the same
building (HJ 246; <bibl>DE ii. 2148</bibl>). Other fragments of walls 
that probably
belong to the castra have been found in front of the Lateran

<p>on the Caelian hill, the barracks of

soldiers detached for special service in Rome from the

They consisted principally of the frumentarii, who were 
originally
employed on supply service, but also used as military 
couriers (their
institution dates perhaps from Augustus), and in the 
second and third

Certain inscriptions relating to these barracks (<bibl>CIL vi. 230</bibl>, 
231 (=30721),

and they
were located by Hulsen (DAP 2. ix. <bibl>(1907)</bibl> 411) and by 
Lanciani (LR 339;

<div xml:id="castra-praetoria" type="entry">
<head>
<placeName>CASTRA PRAETORIA</placeName>
</head> 
<p>* the barracks of the praetorian 
guard, built by Tiberius
at the instigation of Sejanus in <dateRange from="21" to="23">21-23 A.D.</dateRange> when these 
troops were
quartered permanently within the city (Suet. Tib. 37; Tac. 
<bibl>Ann. iv. 2</bibl>;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lvii. 9</bibl>. 6; Schol. <bibl>Iuv. x. 95</bibl>). They were in the 
extreme north-
eastern part of Rome, just beyond the inhabited district 
(Plin. <bibl>NH iii. 67</bibl> ;
Suet. Nero 48; Not. Reg. VI), about 500 metres east of the 
agger, on a
site that was one of the highest in Rome (59-60 metres 
above sea-level),
and commanded both the city and the roads leading to the 
east and
north-east. The camp was constructed on the usual Roman 
model,
forming a rectangle 440 metres long and 380 wide, with 
rounded corners.
The longer axis, the cardo maximus, ran nearly north and 
south, and
at its ends, in the middle of the shorter sides, were the 
porta praetoria
and the porta decumana. It is not certain, however, 
whether the porta
praetoria was on the north side or the south (HJ 387-388 
north, Antonielli,
<bibl>BC 1913, 31-47</bibl> south).  The cardo maximus did not divide 
the castra
equally, and the gates at its ends, porta principalis dextra on 
the west and
porta principalis sinistra on the east, were 190 metres from 
the north side
and 250 from the south.<note anchored="true" place="foot">This has been the view hitherto; but Richmond points 
out that the arrangement of
the barracks shows that the via principalis (which on the 
analogy of all other camps
must have run through in a straight line) can only have run 
from north to south, the east
to west line being interrupted. He therefore places the porta 
praetoria on the west, the
decumana on the east, and the porta principalis dextra and 
sinistra on the north and south
respectively (<bibl>PBS x. 13</bibl>).
</note></p>
<p>The original walls of Tiberius (<bibl>AJA 1912, 398</bibl>) are of 
brick-faced
concrete, 4.73 metres high where they are still preserved 
(see below), and
had battlements and turreted gates (Ill. 13) (Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 
84</bibl>; <bibl>Herod. vii.
11</bibl>.12).  On the inside of the wall were rows of vaulted 
chambers occupied
by soldiers, some of which, on the north and east sides, 
are still visible.
They were 3 metres high, of opus reticulatum lined with 
stucco, and
above them ran a paved walk for the guards (for the 
discovery of these

<pb n="107"/>
and other chambers in the castra, see BC 1872-3, 5, 12-14; <bibl>1876, 176-178</bibl>).
A view of the principia is perhaps to be found on one of 
the 'Aurelian'
panels of the Arch of Constantine (<bibl>PBS iii. 263</bibl>). As would 
be expected
from the importance of the praetorian guard, the castra 
are mentioned
frequently in the literature of the empire (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xi. 31</bibl>; 
<bibl>xii. 69</bibl>;
<bibl>xiii. 14</bibl>; <bibl>xv. 53</bibl>, 59; <bibl>Hist. iii. 84</bibl>; Suet. Claud. 21; Hist.

Max.et Balb.x. 5; Frag.Vat. 195; Herod.ii.6,7; vii. II, 12; 
Chron. 147)
and in inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 9277</bibl>, 9661, 9992), especially 
those on lead
pipes, which show  the care expended by successive 
emperors on the
water supply of the barracks (<bibl>CIL xv. 7237-7244</bibl>;<note anchored="true" place="foot">The provenance of ibid. 7245 is uncertain, and it 
apparently refers to a centurion of
the first cohort of the vigiles.

<p>Two interesting coin types of Claudius represent on the 
reverses his
reception in the praetorian camp after the murder of 
Caligula: the
legends are respectively <foreign xml:lang="la">imper(ator) recept(us)</foreign>, which is 
shown in the
type with a soldier on guard, and <foreign xml:lang="la">praetor(ianus) recept(us)</foreign> 
(i.e. infidem),
i.e. the acceptance by Claudius of the fealty of the 
praetorians-an idea
well symbolised by the clasping of hands (BM Imp. p. 
cliii; Claud. 5,
8-10, 20-25, 28-37, 38 and p. 174 n.. =Cohen, Claud. 40-
46, 77-80).</p>
<p>The regular name of the barracks was castra praetoria, 
but they seem
also to have been called vulgarly castrum praetorium (<bibl>CIL 
xv. 7239</bibl> b, c)
and castrae praetoriae (ib. d); and in the Middle Ages 
castra custodiae
(<bibl>BC 1914, 399</bibl>, 402).  The cohortes urbanae were also 
quartered here
before the construction of the Castra Urbana.</p>
<p>Aurelian incorporated the castra in his line of 
fortification, which
joined the castra at the north-west corner and again near 
the middle of
the south side. The north and east wall of the castra thus 
formed the
continuation of the Aurelian wall, and its original height 
was increased
by an addition of 2.5 to 3 metres at the top and by digging 
away the soil
about its foundations to a depth of 2.3 metres (Homo, 
Aurelien 244-245,
266-268). The original wall can be distinguished from that 
of Aurelian
by the difference in brickwork and by the outline of the 
battlements
(LR fig. 171 shows Aurelian's battlements, and not those 
of Tiberius;
for the latter, see RA 41-46, and especially fig. 46, in 
which both the lines
of battlements are seen). The gates on the north and east 
sides were also
walled up by Maxentius (?).  In 312 Constantine 
disbanded the praetorian
guard and dismantled their barracks, presumably by 
destroying the
inner walls that had not been used by Aurelian (<bibl>Zos. ii. 17</bibl>; 
Aur. Vict.
<bibl>Caes. xl. 25</bibl>; Lact. de mort. pers. 26), although a part of 
the west wall
is reported as standing in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> (<bibl>LS ii. 
243</bibl>; HJ 389, n. 41).</p>
<p>Within the castra was the shrine of the standards of the 
guard (<bibl>CIL
vi. 1609</bibl>; <bibl>Herod. iv. 4</bibl>. 5; <bibl>v. 8</bibl>. 5-7), a tribunal, on which 
these standards
were set up, restored by the statores attached to the 
barracks (<bibl>CIL vi.
3559</bibl>; <bibl>WS  1902, 356-358</bibl>), a shrine of Mars (<bibl>CIL vi. 
2256</bibl>), and an
<pb n="108"/>
armamentarium, or imperial armoury, mentioned twice by 
Tacitus (<bibl>Hist.
i. 38</bibl>. 80) and in two inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 999</bibl>, 2725; <bibl>RE ii. 
1176</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the north part of the castra, east of the north gate, 
was an
altar of Fortuna Restitutrix, of which the remains were 
found in 1888
in a room paved with black and white mosaic (<bibl>NS 1888, 
391</bibl> ; <bibl>BC 1888, 401</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 30876</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This inscription (cf. also <bibl>RE vii. 35</bibl>) belongs to the 
Severan period, and repairs at that
time are vouched for by brickstamps (<bibl>CIL xv. 3</bibl>: Castris 
praetori(s) Aug. n.) which should
be attributed to this period rather than to that of M. Aurelius 
and Commodus. The
bearded head is found again on <bibl>CIL xv. 381</bibl> (<bibl>PBS x. 22</bibl> n. 
4). A Christian cemetery
of the beginning of the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> was also found in the 
castra (De Rossi, Roma <bibl>Sott.
i. 218</bibl>; Grisar, Geschichte Roms, i. 668).
</note> Certain antiquarians of the sixteenth 
and fifteenth
centuries speak of an arcus Gordiani near the porta Chiusa 
(for reff. see
HJ 390, n. 45; <bibl>LS i. 169</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1913, 38</bibl>), and this has been 
connected
by some with architectural fragments found in the via 
Gaeta and the
viale Castro Pretorio (BC 1872-3, 103, 233-237). One or 
more such arches
may very probably have stood in or near the castra, but 
there is no
evidence of an arch of Gordian, or that the fragments 
discovered belonged
to that arch mentioned in the Renaissance (<bibl>BC 1913, 37-42</bibl>). For further
discussion of the castra, see <bibl>Gilb. iii. 198-199</bibl>; HJ 385-
390; LR 439-442
(the relief from an arch with a Victory is at Ny-Karlsberg,

inscribed
amphorae in the camp and vicinity, <bibl>BC 1879, 36-112</bibl>, 143-

367; <bibl>CIL vi.
9969</bibl>), and was standing in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not. Reg. 
XI). The
site of the temple was near the west end of the circus on 
the Aventine
side, but how far up the slope is not certain-perhaps near 
the junction
of the modern Vicolo di S. Sabina and Via S. Maria in 
Cosmedin
(<bibl>Dionys. vi. 94</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. xl. 2</bibl>. 1; DAP 2. vi. 238-239; Merlin 
93-95, and
literature cited there; <bibl>BC 1914, 115</bibl>), but no traces of it 
have been
found.</p>
<p>The worship of Ceres was essentially plebeian, and the 
political
importance of this temple was very great. It was the 
headquarters
of the plebeian aediles, the repository of their archives, and 
the treasury
in which was placed the property of those who had been 
found guilty
of assaulting plebeian magistrates (<bibl>Dionys. vi. 89</bibl>; <bibl>x. 42</bibl> ; 
<bibl>Liv. iii. 55</bibl>. 7).
Copies of senatus consulta were also deposited here after 
<date value="-449">449 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv.
iii. 55</bibl>. 13; Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsr. ii. 476-477</bibl>, 490). The 
temple possessed
the right of asylum (Varr. ap. Non. 44: asylum Cereris), 
and was a centre
of distribution of food to the poor. It was regularly called 
aedes, but
delubrum once by Pliny (<bibl>NH xxxv. 24</bibl>), and in Greek 
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*dhmhtrei=on</foreign> (<bibl>Strabo
viii. 381</bibl>), <foreign xml:lang="greek">*dhmh/trion</foreign> (Cass. Dio 1. 10), and 
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*dh/mhtros i(ero/n</foreign> (App. <bibl>BC i. 78</bibl>).
In ordinary usage the official title was abbreviated to aedes 
Cereris (see
Merlin, passim; HJ 115-117; <bibl>RE iii. 1974-1975</bibl>; <bibl>xiii. 70-73</bibl>;

also a market-place (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. i. 14</bibl>. 1), and within it part of the ceremony
of the triumph took place (<bibl>Liv. xxxix. 5</bibl>; Plut. Lucull. 37).<note anchored="true" place="foot">See also <bibl>JRS 1921, 33-34</bibl>.

Augustus delivered the laudatio of Drusus here (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 2</bibl>. 2); and
in <date value="-2">2 B.C.</date> water was brought into the circus and thirty-six crocodiles
butchered immediately after the dedication of the forum of Augustus
(ib. 10. 8). If P. Meyer (Straboniana, ii. 20) and A. W. Van Buren
(Ann. Brit. Sch. Athens, 1916-18, 48-50) are correct, Strabo (v. 3. 8)
mentions it between the circus Maximus and the forum Romanum.</p>
<p>Extant literature furnishes no information concerning the construction
of the building, its restorations or its contents, except that contained
in the statement of Vitruvius (ix. 9. 1: <foreign xml:lang="la">plinthium sive lacunar quod
etiam in circo Flaminio est positum Scopinas Syracusius (dicitur invenisse)</foreign> ). This circus was so conspicuous a building and so important
a centre that it soon gave its name to the immediate vicinity, and other
buildings were described as <foreign xml:lang="la">ad circum Flaminium</foreign> (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 13</bibl>) or
<foreign xml:lang="la">in circo Flaminio</foreign> (<bibl>Liv. xl. 52</bibl>. 2; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 26</bibl>, and very frequently;
cf. <bibl>Mart. xii. 74</bibl>. 2: <foreign xml:lang="la">accipe de circo pocula Flaminio</foreign>). In the Regionary
Catalogue it is the official name of <rs key="regio9" type="region">Region IX</rs>. It is marked on a fragment
(27) of the Marble Plan (cf. FUR 21-22).  Money changers appear to have
had their stations in its arcades (<bibl>CIL vi. 9713</bibl>). In the Einsiedeln Itinerary
(1. 2; 2.2; 8. 3) the name is wrongly applied to the Stadium, though
some think the Ordo Benedicti has the name correctly (Mon. <bibl>L. i. 521</bibl>;
cf. <bibl>BC 1901, 57</bibl>, 58), while others think the circus is the basilica Iovis.</p>
<p>At the close of the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> a considerable part of the circus,
called castellum aureum, was still standing (a bull of Celestin III of 1192
mentioning the churches of S. Lorenzo and S. Maria in Castello aureo or
de castro aureo (Domnae Rosae; Bullar. <bibl>Vat. i. 74</bibl>; Caetani-Lovatelli,
Passeggiate nella Roma antica, <bibl>Rome 1909, 108-128</bibl>; HCh 284-285, 331) ).
Its ruins were described by Biondo (Roma instaurata iii. 109) in the
<dateRange from="1400" to="1499">fifteenth century</dateRange>, but almost entirely removed in the sixteenth to make
room for the Mattei palace, and the whole site then gradually covered by
modern buildings. Some remains of the curved end lie in and beneath
the Palazzo Caetani in the Piazza Paganica (III. 14) and of the long sides
in various cellars, especially those of the Palazzo Longhi Mattei Paganica.
The construction is of concrete faced with opus reticulatum, but the pillars
are built of large squared blocks of tufa and travertine. None of these
remains can belong to the original date of erection.</p>
<p>The major axis of the circus ran almost due east and west. On the
east (the carceres end) the limits of the circus seem to be set by the discovery of private houses and the pavement of an ancient street just east
<pb n="113"/>
of the Piazza Margana (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1870, 48</bibl> ff.; cf. Fulvius, Antiquitates urbis p. l(x)v; LR 453; <bibl>LS ii. 64-66</bibl>). If so, the length of the
circus was about 260 metres, and its width about 10O.</p>
<p>The few remains (cf. Canina, Edifizi iv. pls. 186, 187) and drawings
of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> architects (LR 454-456; HJ 551, n. 122; <bibl>JRS
1919, 187</bibl>) show that this circus was built on the general plan adopted in
later structures of a similar character, and that its lower story opened
outwards through a series of travertine arcades, between which were
Doric half-columns. In the Middle Ages the arcades on the north side
were converted into dark shops, and gave the name to the street on that
side, the Via delle Botteghe oscure; cf. the churches of S. Lucia de
calcarario or de apothecis obscuris (HCh 300-301; cf. 306, and v. <ref target="anicii-domus-2" n="U">DOMUS
ANICIORUM, 2</ref>) and of S. Salvator in Pensulis (ib. 449) ;<note anchored="true" place="foot"> We may add S. Lorenzo in Pensulis (HCh 293), which is probably the same as
S. Lorenzo in Pallacinis (see <ref target="pallacinae" n="U">PALLACINAE</ref>).
</note> and the memory
of the rope makers who plied their trade in the arena is preserved in the
Via dei Funari and the churches of S. Nicola and S. Caterina dei Funari

Neronis (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 74</bibl>) and circus Vaticanus (ib. xvi. 200), and was
a favourite place for the sports and orgies of Claudius and Nero (cf. Suet.
Claud. 21; Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiv. 14</bibl> (?); Suet. Nero 53 (?)).  On the spina
Caligula erected an obelisk (<ref target="obeliscus-vaticanus" n="U">OBELISCUS VATICANUS</ref> (q.v.) ) from Heliopolis
(Plin. <bibl>NH xvi. 201</bibl>; <bibl>xxxvi. 74</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 882</bibl> =3 1911).</p>
<p>In the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> the north side of the circus was destroyed to
make room for the first basilica of St. Peter, and the south wall and the
two southernmost rows of columns of the church were built on the three
parallel north walls of the circus (see plan in Lanciani, Pagan and Christian
Rome 129).  In the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> two mausolea were erected on part of
the spina, one of them being the tomb of the wife of the Emperor Honorius
(see Lanciani, op. cit. 198-205; Mel. 1902,388). One of these was destroyed
about <date value="1520">1520</date> (see <ref target="sep-mariae" n="U">SEPULCRUM MARIAE</ref>), but the other stood until the
<dateRange from="1700" to="1799">eighteenth century</dateRange> (DuP 38; Cerrati, cit.). For the mediaeval name Palatium Neronianum, see HCh 259 (S. Gregorii de Palatio). Some remains of
the circus were visible in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and in the
seventeenth, when the new church of St. Peter was being built, the ruins
were described by G. Grimaldi, whose notes are extant in several MS.

Structura, published by M. Cerrati, Studi e Testi fasc. 26 <bibl>(1914)</bibl> xxxiv.-
xxxvii.). Cerrati points out that the reason of the collapse of the old
basilica was that its walls were built, not on the centre of the walls of the
circus, but slightly to one side. The axis of the circus ran east and west,
 
<pb n="114"/>
and the carceres were at the east end, toward the Tiber, flanked by two
towers placed unsymmetrically. According to Grimaldi, the circus was
90 metres wide and 161 long, but the length is probably underestimated
(HJ 657-8; LR 551-554; <bibl>RE iii. 2581-2</bibl>); while Cerrati determines the
width as 500, not 400, palms (i.e. 111.50 metres).</p>

<p>the first and largest circus in Rome, which was gradually
built up in the <ref target="vallis-murcia" n="U">VALLIS MURCIA</ref> (q.v.), between the Palatine and Aventine
hills. This valley was admirably adapted for the purpose, being 600
metres long and 150 wide. Here the first recorded games were held (Ov.
Ars <bibl>Am. i. 103-108</bibl>; cf. <bibl>Trist. ii. 283</bibl>; <bibl>Fast. ii. 391-392</bibl>; <bibl>iv. 391</bibl>, 680),

occurred the rape of the Sabine women (Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 20</bibl>; Plut. Rom. 14).
To the Tarquins tradition ascribed the beginnings of the circus and the
assignment of definite places or curiae to senate and knights where they
could erect wooden platforms on supports (fori), from which to view the
games, either to Priscus (<bibl>Liv. i. 35</bibl>. 8; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 68</bibl>. 1) or Superbus (<bibl>Liv.
i. 56</bibl>. 2; <bibl>Dionys. iv. 44</bibl>. 1; de vir. ill. 8 ;<note anchored="true" place="foot">' Foros ' is a conjecture: the text is corrupt.
</note> cf. Chron. 145), but the first
definite statement is that of Livy for <date value="-329">329 B.C.</date> (viii. 20. 1: <foreign xml:lang="la">carceres eo
anno in circo primum statuti</foreign>), which makes it plain that there had been
nothing permanent before that date. These carceres were probably of
wood, for a century later they were painted (Enn. ap. Cic. de div. i. 108:<foreign xml:lang="la">omnes avidi spectant ad carceris oras quam  mox emittat pictis e
faucibus currus</foreign>).  For further mention of the fori publici, see <bibl>Liv.
xxix. 37</bibl> (<date value="-204">204 B.C.</date>); CIL i 2. 809 (<dateRange from="-99" to="-1">first century B.C.</dateRange>).</p>
<p>It is probable that after the carceres the next permanent part of the
circus to be constructed was the spina (see below), and that on it were
placed those statues of which we have record, one of Pollentia (<bibl>Liv.
xxxix. 7</bibl>. 8 (<date value="-189">189 B.C.</date>): <foreign xml:lang="la">malus in circo instabilis in signum Pollentiae
procidit atque id deiecit</foreign>), and others (<bibl>Liv. xl. 2</bibl>. I: <foreign xml:lang="la">signa alia in circo
maximo cum columnis quibus superstabant evertit</foreign>). It is also possible
that the arch of Stertinius (see <ref target="fornix-stertinii" n="U">FORNIX STERTINII</ref>) with its gilded statues,
erected in <date value="-196">196 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. xxxiii. 27</bibl>. 4), may have stood in the line of the
spina, but the temple of <ref target="iuventas-aedes" n="U">IUVENTAS</ref> (q.v.) of 191 (<bibl>Liv. xxxvi. 36</bibl>. 5) was on
one side.  A  permanent spina presupposes the covering over of the
stream, which flowed through the circus. This came from  the valley
between the Caelian and Esquiline, passing through the (marshy ?)
depression which later on Nero converted into the stagnum of the domus
Aurea and then traversed the valley between the Caelian and Palatine.
It was converted into a cloaca, and discharged into the Tiber about
100 metres below the Cloaca Maxima, where its mouth may still be seen
(LF 30, 35; cf. our Ill. 5). In KH iv. it is wrongly connected with the
mediaeval Marrana Mariana (see <ref target="aqua-iulia" n="U">AQUA IULIA</ref>).</p>
<p>In <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> the censors, Q. Fulvius Flaccus and A. Postumius Albinus,
<pb n="115"/>
added considerably to the equipment of the circus, but owing to the
fragmentary condition of the text in Livy (xli. 27. 6), nothing can be made
out with certainty except that they restored the carceres, and set up ova,
or sets of seven large eggs of wood, with which to record the number of
laps run in the races for the benefit of the spectators-an arrangement
that became permanent (Varro, <bibl>RR i. 2</bibl>. II; Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iii. 51</bibl>. 10).
In <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>, at the dedication of the temple of Venus Victrix, Pompeius
caused twenty elephants to fight in the circus, and they broke down the
iron railing with which he had intended to protect the spectators (Plin.
<bibl>NH viii. 20</bibl>, 21). More effective protection was afforded by the moat or
euripus which Caesar constructed in <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date> between the arena and the
seats (Plin. loc. cit.; Suet. Caes. 39: <foreign xml:lang="la">circensibus spatio circi ab utraque
parte producto et in gyrum  euripo addito... venationes editae...
quingenis peditibus elephantis vicenis tricenis equitibus hinc et inde
commissis. nam  quo laxius dimicaretur, sublatae metae inque earum
locum bina castra exadversum constituta erant</foreign>). This passage seems to
mean that Caesar lengthened the circus and removed the goals temporarily,
but does not justify the conclusion (HJ 123) that up to this time there
had been no permanent section of the spina. In <date value="-33">33 B.C.</date> Agrippa placed
on the spina seven dolphins, probably of bronze, which served with the
ova to indicate the laps of the races (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlix. 43</bibl>. 2).</p>
<p>How extensive and how permanent the circus had become before the
Augustan period, it is impossible to say. In <date value="-31">31 B.C.</date> a fire destroyed
a considerable part of it (Cass. Dio 1. 10. 3). Augustus himself records
only the construction or restoration of the pulvinar ad circum maximum
(Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 4</bibl>), a sort of box on the Palatine side of the circus from
which the imperial family could view the games, but Cassiodorus attributes
to him much more (<bibl>Var. iii. 51</bibl>. 4: <foreign xml:lang="la">mundi dominus ad potentiam suam
opus extollens mirandam etiam Romanis fabricam in vallem Murciam
tetendit Augustus</foreign>). Pliny, on the other hand, speaks very distinctly of
the existing circus as the work of the dictator Caesar (<bibl>NH xxxvi. 102</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">nec ut circum  maximum  a Caesare dictatore exstructum  longitudine
stadiorum trium latitudine unius sed cum aedificiis iugerum quaternum
ad sedem CCL inter magna opera dicamus</foreign>). At any rate, our definite
information about the monument, whether due to Caesar or Augustus,
begins with the Augustan period, and subsequent changes probably did
not affect materially its general plan. Besides building the pulvinar,
Augustus set up on the spina the obelisk from  Heliopolis (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxvi. 71</bibl>; <bibl>Ammian. xvii. 4</bibl>. 12), which is now in the Piazza del Popolo
(see <ref target="obelisci-mausolei-augusti" n="U">OBELISCUS AUGUSTI</ref>).</p>
<p>According to Dionysius's description (iii. 68), written in <date value="-7">7 B.C.</date>, the
circus was then one of the most wonderful monuments in Rome, three
and one-half stadia (621 metres) long and four plethra (118 metres) wide,
a euripus or water channel, ten feet wide and ten feet deep, surrounding
the arena except at the carceres end. The seats rose in three sections,

the lower story being built of stone, and the two upper of wood. The
short side, opposite the carceres, was crescent-shaped, and the total
seating capacity was 150,000. The carceres, or chariot stalls, were
without roof, and closed by a rope barrier which could be dropped before
them all at once. Around the outside of the building was a one-storied
arcade containing shops (<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)rgasth/ria</foreign>) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">oi)kh/seis</foreign>, perhaps a sort of
pergola (<bibl>Mitt. 1887, 220</bibl>) above them. Through this colonnade were
entrances to the lower section of seats and stairways to the upper,
arranged alternately to facilitate ingress and egress.</p>
<p>The chambers in the outer arcade, which Dionysius mentions, were
occupied in large part by questionable characters, cooks (Cic. pro Mil. 65),
astrologers (Cic. de div. i. 132; Iuv. 6. 588; Hor. <bibl>Sat. i. 6</bibl>. 113-4) and
prostitutes (Iuv. 3. 65; Priap. 27: Anth. <bibl>Lat. i. 190</bibl>; Hist. Aug. Elag. 26;
Cyprian. de spect. 5). Augustus and succeeding emperors also watched
the games from the imperial residences on the Palatine, or the houses
of their friends, as well as from the pulvinar (Suet. Aug. 45; Claud. 4;
cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 9822</bibl>, and perhaps Fest. 364). That the circus was faced with
marble on the inside, and presumably on the outside also, is to be inferred
from  Ovid (Ars <bibl>Am. i. 103-104</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">tunc neque marmoreo pendebant vela
theatro nec fuerant liquido pulpita rubra croco</foreign>; cf. Calp. Ecl. 7. 69-aet.
Neronis). Augustus is said to have assigned separate seats to the
senators and knights (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 22</bibl>. 4), but apparently not in any fixed
section, for Claudius did this for the senators (Cass. <bibl>Dio lx. 7</bibl>. 3-4; Suet.
Claud. 21), and Nero for the knights (Suet. Nero II; Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 32</bibl>;
Plin. <bibl>HN viii. 21</bibl>; cf. Calp. Ecl. 7. 26-29).</p>
<p>In <date value="36">36 A.D.</date> part of the circus on the Aventine side was burned (Tac. <bibl>Ann.
vi. 45</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio lviii. 26</bibl>. 5). This is called <foreign xml:lang="la">pars circi inter ultores</foreign>
in a fragmentary chronicle of Ostia (<bibl>BC 1916, 211-212</bibl>), where ultores
probably refers to certain di ultores whose shrines were in this part of
the circus.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The reading' inter vitores' (basketmakers) is preferable (Eranos, 1926, 86-88).
</note> The damage was probably repaired at once, for Caligula
celebrated the ludi circenses, evidently with considerable pomp (Suet.
Cal. 18: <foreign xml:lang="la">minio et chrysocolla constrato circo</foreign>; cf. Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 162</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">invenere et alium usum in ramentis squamaque circum maximum ludis
circensibus sternendi ut sit in commendatione candor</foreign>).</p>
<p>Claudius built carceres of marble instead of the tufa, of which they had
previously been constructed, and gilded goals, probably of bronze, in
place of the earlier wooden metae (Suet. Claud. 21). Nero removed the
euripus to make room for additional seats for the equites (Plin. <bibl>NH viii.
21</bibl>), and protected the spectators from the wild beasts by a continuous
round bar of wood, covered with ivory, which revolved and therefore
gave no hold to the animals (Calp. Ecl. 7. 49-53). At some later time
the name euripus was given to basins of water on the spina, or in its line,
and then to the spina itself. Into these basins flowed streams of water
from the mouths of the dolphins (Tert. de spect. 8: <foreign xml:lang="la">delphines Neptuno
<pb n="117"/>
vomunt</foreign>; Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iii. 51</bibl>. 8: <foreign xml:lang="la">euripus maris vitrei reddit imaginem
unde illuc delphini aequorei aquas influunt</foreign>; cf. the mosaics of Barcelona
and Lyons, DS i. figs. 1520, 1523; for euripus used of the whole spina,
Tert. loc. cit. <foreign xml:lang="la">ea (i.e. Magna mater) praesidet euripo</foreign>; adv. Hermog. 31 :
<foreign xml:lang="la">statua super euripum</foreign>; Anth. Lat. 3. 5-6; Sid. Apoll. Carm. 23. 360;
<bibl>RE vi. 1284</bibl>; Lydus, de mens. i. 12).</p>
<p>In <date value="64">64 A.D.</date> the great fire of Nero broke out in the tabernae on the
Palatine side of the circus (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 38</bibl>), and must have destroyed
a considerable part of this side at least. It is probable that in this, as
in other fires, it was only the upper structure of wood that was burned.
Nero evidently rebuilt the circus, for it was in use in 68 when he returned
from Greece and passed through it in triumphal procession (Suet. Nero 25;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lxii. 20</bibl>. 4, 21. 1). Of the circus during the reign of Vespasian
Pliny (<bibl>NH xxxvi. 102</bibl>) says that it was three stadia long, one wide, covered
four iugera of land, and seated 250,000 persons. He calls the circus, the
basilica Aemilia, and the temple of Peace the three most beautiful buildings
in the world. The text of this passage is, however, corrupt, and the
figures are open to question (see below). Again, in the reign of Domitian,
both the long sides were injured by fire (Suet. Dom. 5: <foreign xml:lang="la">naumachia e
cuius postea lapide maximus circus deustis utrisque lateribus extructus
est</foreign>), but to what extent is not known. The restoration was carried out
by Trajan with stone from  Domitian's naumachia; he increased its
seating capacity sufficiently by adding two stadia to the length of the
cavea (<bibl>Pausan. v. 12</bibl>. 6; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxviii. 7</bibl>. 2). A passage in Pliny's
Panegyric (51) seems to mean that Trajan removed a sort of private
box (cubiculum), from which Domitian, while invisible to the people,
had viewed the games, and sat himself exposed to the gaze of the spec-
tators. His enlargement of the circus was probably on the Palatine
side, where an addition two stadia long could have been built on the
north side of the street that bounded the north side of the circus, and
could be connected by arches with the cavea. Whether Pliny's further
statement-<foreign xml:lang="la">populo cui locorum  quinque milia adiecisti</foreign>-refers to the
seats in this addition, is very doubtful (cf. a similar statement in <bibl>CIL
vi. 955</bibl>; Mommsen, Staatsrecht, iii. 446). It was under Trajan that
the circus seems to have reached its greatest size and magnificence.</p>
<p>During the reign of Antoninus Pius there was a ruina circi (Hist. Aug.
Pius 9), doubtless the same catastrophe which is mentioned in Chron. 146:
<foreign xml:lang="la">circensibus Apollinaribus partectorum columna ruit et oppressit homines</foreign>
MCXII. What the partecta were, is not known, but a similar accident is
recorded under Diocletian (ib. 148: partectorum podius ruit et oppressit
homines XIII). Caracalla is said to have enlarged the ianuae circi (ib. 147),
presumably some of the arches of the lower arcade. Constantine restored
the circus magnificently (Aur. Vict. Caes. 40. 27: <foreign xml:lang="la">a quo etiam post circus
maximus excultus mirifice</foreign>; Nazar. Paneg. 35:<foreign xml:lang="la"> circo ipso maximo
sublimis porticus et rutilantes auro columnae tantum inusitati ornatus
<pb n="118"/>
dedere</foreign>), and prepared to bring an obelisk from Heliopolis, which, however,
was actually done by Constantius in 357 (Amm. <bibl>Marc. xvii. 4</bibl>. 12-16).
This was set on the spina and was the highest in Rome (now in the Piazza
del Laterano; see <ref target="obeliscus-constantii" n="U">OBELISCUS CONSTANTII</ref>). References to the circus
and its games in literature after Constantius are numerous (e.g. Amm.
<bibl>Marc. xxviii. 4</bibl>. 29; Symmach. passim), but give practically no informa-
tion about the building except the section of the letter of Theodoric,
contained in Cassiodorus, <bibl>Varia iii. 51</bibl>. In addition to what has been
already quoted from that letter, we learn that the spina was decorated
with reliefs representing Roman generals in triumphal procession over
the bodies of their captives, a scene that recurs on a diptych of the consul
Lampadius of the <dateRange from="400" to="599">fifth-sixth century</dateRange> <bibl>(DS i. fig. 1532)</bibl>.</p>
<p>Additional information about the circus is furnished by fragments
of the Marble Plan (38-40, 124, 153, 370; BC 1899, pl. i. n. 7; cf. HJ 135 n. 63 and pl. iii; also DAP 2. xi. 107-110), reliefs on sarcophagi,
coins, mosaics, and smaller works of art (for lists and descriptions see
Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1863, 137-149</bibl>; <bibl>1870, 232-261</bibl>; Abhandl. d. Berl. <bibl>Akad.
1873, 67-71</bibl>; <bibl>RE iii. 2579-2580</bibl>; HJ 138-139; DS i. figs. 1515-1534).
Modern excavations have brought to light comparatively few remains
of the structure, mainly foundations of some parts of the east end, and
of both the long sides, especially that on the north. The lines of the
paved streets around the building have also been found, so that the exact
site, the orientation, and the principal dimensions of the circus in its final
shape, can be determined with considerable accuracy (<bibl>NS 1876, 101</bibl>,
138-139, 184; <bibl>1877, 8</bibl>, 110, 204; <bibl>1888, 191</bibl>, 226-227; <bibl>Mitt. 1892, 295</bibl>;
<bibl>1893, 289</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1888, 171</bibl>; <bibl>1908, 241-253</bibl>; Me1. 1908, 229-231; <bibl>1909,
132-135</bibl>; <bibl>CRA 1908, 327-328</bibl>). The ruins under S. Anastasia (HJ 134
n. 616; ZA 269-274) form no part of the circus proper, but belong to
buildings on the lower slopes of the Palatine. Only the arched chambers
on the right of the church belong to the circus.</p>
<p>The length of the arena was 568 metres, and its width increased from
75 metres at the carceres to 84 at the beginning of the spina and 87 at its
east end. The length of the spina was 344 metres, and the total length
of the circus 600. The width of the cavea proper was 27 metres, but
this was much increased by the additions built over the streets on the
north and south sides. The extreme width thus secured on the Palatine
side was about 80 metres, and the maximum width of the circus about 200
(M61. 1908, 229-231; <bibl>BC 1908, 248-249</bibl>).</p>
<p>The exterior had three stories with arches and engaged columns, like
the Colosseum, but all covered with marble. The cavea was divided
into three bands or zones of seats, separated by corridors. The upper
and perhaps the middle zone were probably made of wood. The arrangement of approaches and stairways was also probably somewhat like that
of the Colosseum.  The west end contained the carceres or stalls for
the chariots (Varro, <bibl>LL. v. 153</bibl>), set on a curve so that the distance was
<pb n="119"/>
the same from each to the starting line (alba linea, Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iii. 5</bibl> . 7)
drawn across the arena which marked the start and finish. The carceres,
twelve in number (ib. 4), were closed by rope barriers supported by small
hermae (hermulae), which were dropped simultaneously at the start.
This fact probably explains the use of the name Duodecim portae (Obseq.
70; Not. Reg. XI) for this end of the building. Above the middle of
the carceres was the box of the magistrate presiding over the games,
from which he gave the signal for the start with a mappa (Cassiod. Var.
loc. cit.; Suet. Nero 22). At each end of the carceres were towers and
battlements suggesting a walled town, and this part of the circus was
sometimes called oppidum (Varro, cit.; Fest. 184). The east end of the
circus was curved, with a gateway in the centre through which the
procession seems to have usually entered at the beginning of the games.
In <date value="81">81 A.D.</date> this gateway was replaced by a triple arch, erected by the
senate in honour of Titus and his capture of Jerusalem (<bibl>CIL vi. 944</bibl>).
It is represented on the Marble Plan (fr. 38). A podium, or raised
platform, surrounded the arena. On this were the chairs of high officials,
and from it the cavea rose gradually. On the spina were the two obelisks,
the eggs and dolphins (see above), and at each end the metae or goals,
three cones of gilt bronze (Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iii. 51</bibl>. 7). The altar of <ref target="consus-ara" n="U">CONSUS</ref>
(q.v.) was near the east end of the spina, and other shrines seem to be
represented on the reliefs. Tertullian (de spect. 8)) gives a list of various
divinities who were worshipped in the circus -- CASTOR AND POLLUX, SOL, MAGNA MATER, NEPTUNE, VENUS MURCIA (qq.v.), and some minor
deities. Their shrines were either on the spina or in the cavea (HJ 140).</p>
<p>The seating capacity of the circus has given rise to much discussion.
Dionysius' statement (iii. 68) that the Augustan building held 150,000
spectators, and Pliny's (xxxvi. 102) that in his time it held 250,000, have
both been questioned; and that of the Notitia that in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>
it had 385,000 loca has been interpreted to mean that number of running
feet of seats, which would accommodate about 200,000 spectators. This
seems reasonable, but there is no doubt that the capacity of the building
was greatly increased after the time of Augustus and on this basis
Dionysius' figure would seem too high. Estimates of the final capacity
vary from  a maximum  of 385,000 to a minimum  of 140,000, but no
certainty has been reached (<bibl>BC 1894, 321-324</bibl>; Richter 178; HJ 137;
<bibl>RE iii. 2578</bibl>).</p>
<p>Throughout the republic the circus was used for gladiatorial combats
and fights with wild beasts, as well as for races; but after the building of
the amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus, and still more after the erection
of the Colosseum, the first species of entertainment was largely, although
not entirely removed from the circus. The last recorded games took place
under Totila in <date value="550">550 A.D.</date> (Procop. b. <bibl>Goth. iii. 37</bibl>), and in that century
the destruction of the circus began. The form of the circus was still
clearly recognisable in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> (DuP 107-112). At present
<pb n="120"/>
a small portion of the seats at the curved end, on the N.E. side, are still
visible, and traces were found further N.W. in making a drain in 1873-4
along the Via dei Cerchi <bibl>(Mora in Messaggero, 25th March, 1924)</bibl>. The
name de gradellis, applied to churches of S. Gregorio and S. Maria (HCh
258, 336 sqq.) does not refer to the circus (<bibl>LS i. 90</bibl>) but probably to the
steps that descended to the mills in the Tiber. See in general HJ 120-
144; <bibl>RE iii. 2572-2581</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 454-456</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 313-319</bibl>; <bibl>DS ii. 1187</bibl>-

<p> a temple of the deified Claudius on the

divi Claudi in Caelio monte, coeptum quidem ab Agrippina sed a Nerone
prope funditus destructum</foreign>). This destruction was probably due, in part
at least, to the construction of the distributing station of the aqua Claudia,
which Nero extended to the Caelian (Frontin. de aquis i. 20; <bibl>ii. 76</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> We may associate with these alterations the fine fountain decoration in the shape of a
ship's prow found near the arch of Constantine (<bibl>BC 1882, 63</bibl>; Bocconi, Musei Capitolini,

</note>
Part of it may have been sacrificed to the domus Aurea, which extended
to the north-west corner of the Caelian opposite the Colosseum, where
this temple stood, the site now occupied by the gardens of the Passionist
Fathers. It is mentioned in one inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 10251</bibl>a), and Aurelius
Victor (Caes. 9, cf. Epit. 9) speaks of Claudii monumenta. There was also
a porticus Claudia (Mart. de spect. 2. 9-10: <foreign xml:lang="la">Claudia diffusas ubi porticus
explicat umbras/Ultima pars aulae deficientis erat</foreign>), which was clearly
just inside the limits of the domus Aurea, and would most naturally be
located on the Caelian in connection with the temple of Claudius (FUR
p. 33; cf. however, Mnemosyne, 1906, 83-84).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The reading desipientis (=insanae) is here proposed.
</note> Three fragments of the
Marble Plan (45, 77, 96) probably belong together and represent parts of
<pb n="121"/>
this temple and the buildings of the aqueduct, but they contain no indication of a porticus (<bibl>Mitt. 1903, 20</bibl>). Nevertheless, it is probable that the
porticus Claudia surrounded the temple.</p>
<p>The last mention of the temple is in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not. Reg. II),
though a bull of Honorius III of 1217 speaks of the <foreign xml:lang="la">formae et alia aedificia
positae intra clausuram Clodei</foreign>. Nothing is known of the history of its
destruction. It was (if the combination suggested above of the fragments of the forma Urbis is correct) prostyle hexastyle, fronting towards
the north, and stood on a lofty and extensive podium, some of the substructures of which have been excavated and are now visible (<bibl>LS i. 71</bibl>;
<bibl>iii. 76</bibl>; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1882, 205</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1880, 463</bibl>; <bibl>1909, 427</bibl>). These
substructures are different on the different sides of the podium, those on
the west consisting of double rows of travertine arches with engaged
columns and entablature; those on the north containing what seem to
be reservoirs for water; and those on the east consisting of alternately
square and semicircular recesses which are separated from the podium
by narrow passages. These passages are, probably, simply air spaces.
The recesses are divided from one another by narrow semicircular niches
in groups of three. This difference in style and construction is probably
due to the combination of temple and nymphaeum which was the result
of Vespasian's restoration (HJ 232-234; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 124</bibl>; LA 371; ZA
144 sqq.; Rivoira, RA 68, 73, who assigns the brick facing of the concrete

Q. Fulvius Flaccus and A. Postumius Albinus, and a porticus was built
on the right side of the road from the temple of Saturn to the Capitolium
(<bibl>Liv. xli. 27</bibl>. 7; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 71</bibl>). It is probable, however, that this
porticus did not extend below the depression in later times. In <date value="-190">190 B.C.</date>
Scipio erected a decorative arch at the top of the clivus (<bibl>Liv. xxxvii. 3</bibl>).</p>
<p>This was the only means of access to the mons Capitolinus except
the flights of steps-Centum Gradus, Gradus Monetae (?)-and afforded
a convenient place for commanding the forum with troops (Cic. pro Sest.
28; post red. 12 ; <bibl>Phil. ii. 16</bibl>, 19; ad Att. ii. I. 7). Along part of it,
probably Inter duos Lucos, there were private houses (Cic. pro Mil. 64:
<foreign xml:lang="la">domus in clivo Capitolino scutis referta</foreign>).</p>
<p>The clivus begins near the arch of Tiberius at the corner of the basilica
Iulia.  Here some arches of the time of Sulla are preserved, which
supported it and a street branching from it (they have by some been
wrongly explained as the <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref> (q.v.; cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 13-16</bibl>; HC 71),
It then skirts the north front and the west side of the temple of Saturn.
making a sharp turn at the corner of the porticus deorum Consentium,
and ascends to the Asylum with an average gradient of 1: 8. Part of the
back wall of the porticus serves as a foundation for the clivus, but its
upper course has been changed by more recent structures. Portions
of the lava pavement of the clivus still exist at various points near the
bottom of the ascent, including a small piece attributable to <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>
and another attributable to Sulla; while that in front of the temple is
one of the best specimens of Augustan paving in Rome, having been
preserved by the erection upon it of the church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus
<pb n="123"/>
(see <ref target="sacra-via" n="U">SACRA VIA</ref>). Another piece of its pavement may be seen to the
south of the porticus Deorum Consentium (a good deal is hidden by the
modern road) and another to the south-west of the Tabularium (KH iv.).
No trace remains of the upper part of the clivus or of the branch that led
to the arx, which was at first the more important of the two. It is
probable that the clivus reached the substructures of the area Capitolina
on its north-east side, then turned at right angles, and with a rather
steep rise of perhaps 1: 15 passed around the south corner of the area,
and entered it on the south-east side. The <ref target="porta-stercoraria" n="U">PORTA STERCORARIA</ref> (q.v.)

</note> Even in the time of
Theodoric the cloacae of Rome were objects of wonder (Cassiod. <bibl>Var.
iii. 30</bibl>). This tradition has been strikingly confirmed-and it is one of
the most important historical results of the recent excavations in the
forum-by the fact that the latest tombs in the prehistoric necropolis
of the forum belong to the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth century B.C.</dateRange> (<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 115</bibl>; HC 4).</p>
<p>The course of the cloaca Maxima proper began in the Argiletum,
where it collected the waters of the Esquiline, Viminal and Quirinal, and
flowed through the forum  and Velabrum  to the Tiber.  The windings
of the whole of its course show that it was in origin a stream flowing
through a marshy valley, which Tarquin regulated by walls; and despite
what the writers of the empire say about his having constructed it
underground from the first, Plautus's reference to it as canalis (Curc. 476)
has led most scholars to suppose that it was not roofed until after his own
time.<note anchored="true" place="foot">Cf. also <foreign xml:lang="la">canalicolac forenses</foreign> (Fest. 45).
</note> Some of its windings too appear to have been due to the erection of
buildings under the empire, e.g. that near the temple of Minerva, though
the style of construction seems older (see below).
<pb n="127"/></p>
<p>It is probable that nothing remains of the original drain, though a
small section in cappellaccio under the basilica Aemilia may be attributed
to such an early period; but it has not yet been properly described
(<bibl>CR 1901, 137-138</bibl>; TF 69-74). Some of the branch drains near the
temple of Saturn, on the other hand, may be assigned to the beginning
of the <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth century B.C.</dateRange> at latest (<bibl>JRS 1925, 121</bibl> ; ASA 3).</p>
<p>In the rest of its course there is nothing belonging to any period before
the <dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third century B.C.</dateRange>, and much is a good deal later, being assignable
to the restorations of Agrippa. The whole, however, needs further
examination in the light of modern criteria.</p>
<p>The cloaca proper seems to have begun near the north-west corner
of the forum of Augustus. From  this point to the via Alessandrina
it is built entirely of peperino, vaulted, and paved with blocks of lava-
the characteristic style of the republic; while onwards as far as the forum
the roof has been restored in brick-faced concrete of the empire. The
channel is here 4.20 metres high and 3.20 wide. Eight branches empty
into this section-none of them, as Lanciani notes, from private houses,
which must have relied largely on cesspools. Beneath the nave of the
basilica Aemilia the channel of the cloaca Maxima has been found crossing
it obliquely; this portion had been rebuilt in tufa and travertine in <date value="34">34 A.D.</date>
Originally it appears to have run in the direction of the column of Phocas
(TF fig. 10, p. 69), though it must soon have turned westward; but a
branch was built (in <date value="-78">78 B.C.</date>, as Frank thinks-but did the cloaca at that
time already run round the outside of the basilica ?) to connect it with
the line of the cloaca as rebuilt (by Agrippa ?), which skirted the basilica
on the north-west and south-west, then turned at right angles to the
south-west near the shrine of Venus Cloacina, crossed the area of the
forum, passed under the east end of the basilica Iulia, and thence into
the Velabrum. According to Ficoroni (Roma Antica, i. 74) the whole
of this lower section was cleared in 1742; the conduit was found to
be built of blocks of travertine and was as much as 10 metres below
ground. A part of it, belonging to the republican period, with later
restorations, is still visible opposite the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro.
It has recently been connected with the main sewer of modern Rome,
so that the forum can no longer be inundated by its backwash (<foreign xml:lang="la">aliquando
Tiberis retro infusus recipitur</foreign>, as Pliny says), as it was, for the last time, in
the flood of 1901: <foreign xml:lang="la">Vidimus flavum  Tiberim  retortis litore Etrusco

a combination of Gabine stone and Grotta Oscura stone, are assigned to

<foreign xml:lang="la">apud Cloacinae sacrum</foreign>). In process of time Cloacina was arbitrarily
identified with Venus and called Venus Cloacina (Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 119</bibl> : <foreign xml:lang="la">traditur myrtea verbena Romanos Sabinosque, cum propter raptas virgines

shrine belong probably to the first period in the history of the <ref target="cloaca-maxima" n="U">CLOACA
MAXIMA</ref> (q.v.), although tradition ascribed it to Titus Tatius (Lact. <bibl>Inst.
i. 20</bibl>. 11).  Coins struck during the second triumvirate (Babelon, ii. 242;

represent a small round structure with a metal balustrade, the legend
<ref target="cloacina-sacrum" n="U">CLOACIN</ref>, and two female figures, one holding a flower, which evidently
represent Venus Cloacina. There is no doubt that this is the shrine
of which the foundations were discovered directly in front of the basilica
Aemilia in 1899-1901. The existing remains stand over the drain that
flows under the basilica, near the point where it empties into the cloaca
Maxima, and consist of a marble base, round except on the west side,
where it has a rectangular projection, 2.40 metres in diameter, resting
on a slab of travertine and eight courses of various kinds of stone. The
character of these courses shows that the foundation was gradually
raised as the basilica encroached upon it (<bibl>Mitt. 1893, 284</bibl>; <bibl>1902, 45</bibl>;

fragment (36) of the Marble Plan, and represents a rectangular building
with its main axis extending due north and south at an angle of 18
degrees with the via Lata, and divided into three parts, each of which
consisted of a central court surrounded by a porticus and rows of
chambers.  Extensive remains brought to light by the excavations of
the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange> showed, however, that many changes had been
made in the barracks after the time of Severus (HJ 461, and literature
there cited; <bibl>NS 1912, 337</bibl>).</p>
<p>II on the Esquiline (Not. Reg. V), at the south end of the Piazza
Vittorio  Emanuele (<bibl>CIL vi. 414</bibl>, 1059; ib. (not in situ) 2962-68,

the present church of S. Stefano Rotondo (<bibl>CIL vi. 221</bibl>, 222, 1057, 1058;

building were found in the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">sixteenth century</dateRange> (<bibl>LS ii. 132</bibl>) and in 1820

<p>The location of the other three barracks is uncertain:</p>

(<bibl>CIL vi. 2969-71</bibl>, 3761=31320, 32753-6), but the statio was probably
just inside the porta Viminalis, near the east corner of the baths of
Diocletian (HJ 374; BC 1872-3, 250; <bibl>1876, 107</bibl>, 174; Jord. i. I. 309;
<bibl>ii. 122</bibl>; <bibl>CIL xv. 7245</bibl>-this pipe may have been found near this site,

<p>VI in <rs key="regio8" type="region">Region VIII</rs> (Not.), but the inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 2984-92</bibl>; 32757)
are without topographical value. For a supposed excubitorium in the
forum, see <bibl>NS 1902, 96</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1902, 31</bibl>; Atti 570: <bibl>CIL vi. 3909</bibl>.</p>
<p>VII in <rs key="regio14" type="region">Region XIV</rs> (Not.). No traces of the statio of this cohort
have been found, but considerable remains of one of the excubitoria were
discovered in 1866 at the monte de' Fiori, near the church of S. Crisogono.
The building, which appears to have been originally a large private house,
belongs to the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange> with later additions, and on its walls
are many graffiti (<bibl>CIL vi. 2998-3091</bibl>), dating <dateRange from="215" to="245">from 215 to 245 A.D.</dateRange> and
containing much information in regard to the organisation of the corps.
The portion excavated consists of a central atrium with mosaic pavement
and a hexagonal fountain, and adjacent apartments, among them  a
lararium and a balneum (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1867, 8-30</bibl>; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1874,

order to make room for the temple of Venus and Roma, it is said, without
taking it down (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19). Commodus (Hist. Aug. Com. 17;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxii. 22</bibl>) converted it into a statue of himself as Hercules;
but at his death it was restored as the Sun and so remained (Cohen, Comm.

was built by Hadrian still exists, between the Colosseum and the temple
of Venus and Roma. It is 7 metres square, of brick-faced concrete, and
was originally covered with marble (see also Hieron. ad a. Abr. 2090;

Remains of what may be the base on which it stood originally exist
under the monastery of S. Francesca Romana. The mention of it in

interesting record of the persistence in Christian times of a picturesque
spring festival celebrated by the sellers of garlands on the Sacra via. The
famous saying quoted by Bede (Collect. 1. iii.), '<foreign xml:lang="la"> quamdiu stabit coliseus,
stabit et Roma; quando cadet coliseus, cadet et Roma; quando cadet
Roma, cadet et mundus,</foreign>' should be referred, not to the amphitheatre
but to the statue, which had no doubt fallen long before (Nissen, Ital.

</head> 
<p>a column, erected in memory of Antoninus Pius
by his two adopted sons, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (<bibl>CIL vi. 1004</bibl>).
It stood in the campus Martius, on the edge of the elevation now known
as Monte Citorio, and belonged architecturally to the <ref target="ustrinum-antoninorum" n="U">USTRINUM</ref> (q.v.),
being 25 metres north of it with the same orientation. The column was
a monolith of red granite, 14.75 metres in height and 1.90 in diameter, and
was quarried in <date value="106">106 A.D.</date>, as is shown by the masons' inscription on its
lower end (<bibl>IG xiv. 2421</bibl>. 1). It stood on a pedestal of white marble,
surrounded with a grating, and was surmounted by a statue of Antoninus,
as is represented on coins issued after his death (Cohen, Ant. Pius 353-6).
Previous to the eighteenth century the base of the column was entirely
buried, but the lower part of the shaft projected about 6 metres above the
ground. In 1703 the base was excavated, but the shaft lay in the Piazza
Colonna until 1764 when unsuccessful attempts were made to repair it.
Some pieces were used to restore the obelisk of Augustus that is now in
the Piazza di Monte Citorio, and the lower part was taken to the Vatican.
Three of the sides of the pedestal, which is now in the Giardino della
Pigna in the Vatican, are covered with reliefs. The principal one, representing the apotheosis of Antoninus and Faustina, was turned towards
the Ustrinum. The opposite side bears the dedicatory inscription, and
the reliefs on the other two represent scenes from the <foreign xml:lang="la">decursus equitum</foreign>

the building of a separate lodge for the procurator of the column in

<foreign xml:lang="la">columna Cochlis</foreign>, either because of the spiral band of relief surrounding
it (cf. Cels. 8. 10. 1: <foreign xml:lang="la">fascia circa fracturam ter voluta sursum versum

in the interior (cf. Thes. Ling. Lat. s.v. for the use of cochlea in this sense,
both literally and metaphorically), as Isid. Orig. 15. 2. 38 suggests. It
was called centenaria because it was one hundred feet high.</p>
<p>This monument was more carefully preserved than most of those in
Rome, having been given in the <dateRange from="900" to="999">tenth century</dateRange> by Popes Agapetus II and
John XII to the Benedictines of S. Silvestro in capite, with the little church
of S. Andrea de Columna <note anchored="true" place="foot"> There was also a church of S. Lucia de Columna (HCh 302).
</note> (HCh 182, 183), but it suffered somewhat from
fire and earthquake. In the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> repairs were made by the
municipal authorities, and also by Sixtus V in 1589 and the following
year, when Fontana, his architect, placed on top of the column the present
statue of St. Paul. He also chiselled off from the pedestal what remained
of the reliefs on its four sides-sacrificial scenes with Victories and garlands-and encased its upper part, above ground, with marble, some of
which came from  the Septizonium  (<bibl>LS iii. 146-149</bibl>).  The dedicatory
inscription had long ago disappeared, and is not recorded by any author.</p>
<p>The column is a direct imitation of that of Trajan, the height of shaft,
torus, and capital being the same, 100 Roman feet (29.77 metres), but
tapers less and therefore seems more massive. The shaft itself, 26.50
metres in height and 3.90 in diameter, is composed of 26 rings of Luna
marble. It is hollow, and contains a spiral stairway with 200 steps.
The interior is lighted by 56 rectangular loop-holes. Therefore the
statement of Reg. (Reg. IX: <foreign xml:lang="la">columnam cochlidem altam pedes CLXXV. s,
gradus intus habet CCIII, fenestras LVI</foreign>) is incorrect in its first two items.
<pb n="133"/>
The shaft stands on a plinth and torus decorated with oak leaves, 1.385
metres high, and its capital is 1.5 metres in height and of the Doric
order. The exterior of the shaft is adorned with reliefs arranged in a
spiral band which returns upon itself twenty-one times. These reliefs
represent scenes in the campaigns of Aurelius and correspond to those
on the column of Trajan, but are inferior in execution (for the explanation
of these columns as book-rolls, see Birt, quoted under <ref target="forum-traiani" n="U">FORUM TRAIANI</ref>).
It is probable that the temple of Aurelius (see <ref target="divus-marcus-templum" n="U">DIVUS MARCUS, TEMPLUM</ref>)
stood just west of the column, and that both were surrounded by a
porticus (for column and reliefs, see the definitive work of Petersen,

earlier still. The pedestal was probably built at the same time as those

simply set the statue of Phocas on the column and constructed the
pyramid of tufa steps around the pedestal (as Nichols in Archaeologia

<placeName>COMITIUM</placeName>
</head>
<p>* the place of assembly of ancient Rome (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 155</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">comitium ab eo quod coibant eo comitiis curiatis et litium causa</foreign>). Until
Mommsen's article (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1845, 288-318</bibl>) the comitium  was
believed to have been a building situated at the east end of the forum.
In reality it was an open space, upon which troops could march (<bibl>Liv. v. 55</bibl>),
and prodigies such as the raining of blood could be observed (ib. xxxiv. 45);
and when it is spoken of as tectum (ib. xxvii. 36), this only means that
awnings were spread over it (cf. Plin. <bibl>NH  xix. 23</bibl>). Its site was
<pb n="135"/>
conjecturally fixed as early as 1870 (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 318, n. 3), but certainty was
only reached when the <ref target="curia-iulia" n="U">CURIA IULIA</ref> (q.v.) was correctly identified. For
comitium and curia were connected through all time (<bibl>Liv. xlv. 24</bibl>. 12:<foreign xml:lang="la">comitium vestibulum curiae</foreign>).</p>
<p>The comitium was the political centre of ancient Rome until the
<dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange> Macrob. (<bibl>Sat. iii. 16</bibl>. 15) refers to the administration
of justice as still going on there in <date value="-161">161 B.C.</date>, though the tribes usually voted
in the forum. In <date value="-145">145 B.C.</date> the tribune C. Licinius Crassus was the first,
we are told, to lead the legislative assembly of the people from the
comitium to the forum (Cic. Lael. 25, 96; Varro, <bibl>RR i. 2</bibl>. 9; cf. Plaut.
Curc. 400 ff.), and Plutarch must be wrong in attributing the step to
Gaius Gracchus (5).</p>
<p>The republican comitium was a templum or inaugurated plot of ground
(Cic. <bibl>Rep. ii. 11</bibl> : <foreign xml:lang="la">fecit et saepsit... comitium  et curiam</foreign>) orientated
according to the cardinal points of the compass. In the centre of the
north side was the curia; on the west were the carcer and the basilica
Porcia; on the south were the rostra and the Graecostasis; while the
<ref target="senaculum" n="U">SENACULUM</ref> (q.v.) was further off.
For the various archaic monuments which stood in the comitium, see
<ref target="ficus-navia" n="U">FICUS NAVIA</ref>, <ref target="ficus-navia" n="U">PUTEAL IN COMITIO</ref>, <ref target="ficus-navia" n="U">STATUA ATTI NAVI</ref>, <ref target="ficus-navia" n="U">STATUA HERMODORI</ref>, <ref target="ficus-navia" n="U">STATUA HORATII COCHLITIS</ref>.</p>
<p>Until recent excavations, the comitium was buried to a depth of over
30 feet; but it has now been completely cleared from the front of the
curia Iulia, except on the north-west. The twenty-seven different strata
recognised by Boni in his stratigraphic explorations may be reduced to
fourteen main divisions, which represent five successive elevations
(Van Deman in <bibl>JRS 1922, 6-11</bibl>, whose account is here followed).</p>
<p>The whole question is closely connected with the problems concerning
the <ref target="rostra-vetera" n="U">ROSTRA VETERA</ref> (q.v.). It seems that the latter changed its orientation more than once, but whether we should suppose that the comitium
and the curia did the same is doubtful, though one would naturally suppose
a certain amount of symmetry.</p>
<p>The five successive elevations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At about 10.40 to 10.60 metres above sea-level, traces were found
of a layer of beaten earth not unlike a primitive pavement ; and a little
above this a compact stratum of a large number of broken roof tiles of
an early type was brought to light at the same time. They are clearly
the debris of some building or buildings close at hand destroyed by fire,
and belonging to the level below them. They cannot, it is held, be
earlier than the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">6th century B.C.</dateRange>, and it may be the fire that followed
the Gallic invasion of <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date> that is in question.</p>
<p>(2) At 10.85 to 10.90 above sea-level, i.e. at the same level as the
cappellaccio pavements of the forum, a hard stratum of tufa and earth
beaten together was found. It was about 8 cm. thick, and was either
the bed of a pavement or the pavement itself; for from it a low flight
<pb n="136"/>
of steps led up to the platform of the rostra Vetera (the straight flight
of steps in HC pl. v., where it is shown in black and lettered rostra
Vetera?) and a similar flight of steps descended to the same level in
front of the curia Iulia (also shown in black on the plan cited). The
rostra Vetera separated the comitium from the forum on the south, and
themselves faced due south, while the career, which faced almost due
east, formed its western boundary; but its northern and eastern limits
have not yet been ascertained at this period (later on, the former is marked
by the tabernae of the forum Iulium; while on the east it cannot have
extended, one would think beyond the cloaca Maxima).</p>
<p>(3) Half a metre higher, at 11.35 to 11.50 metres above sea-level,
are portions of structures which point to a rise in level; no traces of a
pavement have so far been found, though a thin layer of earth and tufa
may have represented it.</p>
<p>(4) A foot higher again, at 11.80 metres above sea-level, is another
floor, from which the curved steps of the rostra Vetera ascend. No actual
pavement is preserved, but the level is clear from a line of tufa slabs on
which the rostra rests.</p>
<p>(5) Higher again, at 12.63 metres above sea-level, is a pavement of
finely cut and laid travertine slabs immediately in front of the curia,
generally attributed to the restoration of Faustus Sulla (see <ref target="curia-iulia" n="U">CURIA</ref>); their
orientation does not agree with that of the curia nor of the rostra.</p>
<p>Above it, and directly in front of the later steps of the curia is a
pavement of blocks of Luna marble, 13.50 metres above sea-level, which
represents the level of the Comitium as established by Caesar. It was
now quite a small area, divided off from the forum by a screen supported
by pilasters, the holes for which are visible (or this line may have divided
the comitium  into two parts; but if so, it is difficult to assign any
other boundary to it).  Beyond this the pavement was of slabs of
travertine, which still exists round the black marble pavement, or
niger lapis (?), and towards the Arch of Severus. The reason for the
reduction in size of the Comitium was the construction of the Saepta,
in consequence of which it ceased to have any raison d'etre.</p>
<p>The latest pavement of the comitium  begins at abo it  11 metres
from the front of the curia and extends in a fragmentary condition as
far as the black marble pavement. It consists of roughly laid slabs of
travertine, and is about 20 centimetres higher than the marble pavement
just described. Resting partly on each of the two pavements is the
circular marble basin of a fountain, with an octagonal space for the foot
of a large bowl-perhaps that which now stands on the Quirinal (<bibl>BC 1900, 13-25</bibl>).  Good though the workmanship is, it is generally assigned
to the fourth or <dateRange from="500" to="599">fifth century A.D.</dateRange></p>
<p>In the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century A.D.</dateRange> several pedestals with dedicatory inscriptions were set up in the comitium-a dedication by Maxentius to Mars
Invictus and the founders of the city (see <ref target="sep-romuli-1" n="U">SEPULCRUM ROMULI</ref>), a
<pb n="137"/>
dedication to Constantius by Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus and a third
with scanty traces of a dedication to Iulianus.</p>
<p>At various points in the comitium are twenty-one small, shallow pits
made of slabs of tufa set vertically, of various shapes; they are generally
covered with stone slabs, and are similar to those found in the forum,
which, however, are rectangular. Most of those in the comitium were
filled with debris of the end of the republic. Their purpose is quite
uncertain-they may have served to contain the remains of sacrifices,
and are therefore called ' pozzi rituali ' ; or they may have served (though
this seems unlikely) to carry away rain water; or they may have been
intended to hold wooden posts (like flagstaffs) for festivals (ZA 77).</p>

vowed by L. Furius Camillus in <date value="-367">367 B.C.</date> during the disturbances that
took place over the passage of the Licinian laws. Its erection was voted
by the people immediately after their enactment (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 641-644</bibl>;
Plut. Cam. 42). It stood between the Volcanal and the foot of the
Capitoline (Ov. cit. 637-638; Act. Arv. passim; Serv. <bibl>Aen. ii. 116</bibl>; Stat.
Silv. i. I. 31; Plut. Cam. 42; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 148</bibl>, 156), and the space around

The date of the actual erection of the temple is not known; the day of
its dedication was probably 22nd July (Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 103</bibl>),
while that of the later structure was 16th January (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 637</bibl>;

(App. <bibl>BC i. 26</bibl>; Plut. C. Gracch. 17; Cic. pro Sest. 140; August. de civ.
d. iii. 25). Opimius probably built his <ref target="basilica" n="U">BASILICA</ref> (q.v.) at the same
<pb n="139"/>
time, close to the temple on the north. In <date value="-7">7 B.C.</date> Tiberius undertook to
restore the temple with his spoils from Germany (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 8</bibl>. 2), and
the structure was completed and dedicated as <foreign xml:lang="la">aedes Concordiae Augustae</foreign>,
in the name of Tiberius and his dead brother Drusus, on 16th January,
<date value="10">10 A.D.</date> (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 640</bibl>, 643-648; Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi. 25</bibl>; Suet. Tib. 20, where
the year is given as <date value="12">12 A.D.</date>). It is represented on coins (Cohen, Tib.
68-70; BM. Tib. 116, 132-4). A later restoration, perhaps after the fire
of 284, is recorded in an inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 89</bibl>), which was seen on the
pronaos of the temple by the copyist of the inscriptions in the Einsiedeln
Itinerary.</p>
<p>After the restoration by Opimius, this temple was frequently used
for assemblies of the senate (Cic. <bibl>Cat. iii. 21</bibl>: pro Sest. 26; de domo
111; <bibl>Phil. ii. 19</bibl>, 112; <bibl>iii. 31</bibl>; <bibl>v. 18</bibl>; Sall. Cat. 46,49 ; Cass. Dio lviii.

ii. 159), and as a meeting-place for the Arval Brethren (see Henzen, p. 5,
for list from <date value="63">63 A.D.</date>; <bibl>DE i. 176</bibl>).</p>
<p>Tiberius compelled the Rhodians to sell him a statue of Vesta for
this temple (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 9</bibl>. 6), and it evidently became a sort of museum,
for Pliny mentions many works of art that were placed in it-statues of
Apollo and Juno by Baton (xxxiv. 73), Latona with the infant Apollo
and Diana by Euphranor (77), Aesculapius and Hygeia by Niceratus (80),
Mars and Mercury by Piston (89), Ceres Jupiter and Minerva by Sthennis
(90), paintings of Marsyas by Zeuxis (xxxv. 66), Liber by Nicias (131),
Cassandra by Theodorus (144) ; four elephants of obsidian dedicated by
Augustus (196) ; and a famous sardonyx that had belonged to Polycrates
of Samos <bibl>(xxxvii. 4; see also Jacobi, Grundzuge einer Museographie

<p>A few other incidental references to the temple occur (Val. <bibl>Max. ix. 7</bibl>.4;

ii. 32</bibl>). Several dedicatory inscriptions have been found among its ruins
(<bibl>CIL vi. 90-94</bibl>, 30856, 30857), and three others mention an aedituus of
the temple (2204, 2205, 8703). It is represented on a coin of Orbiana,
the wife of Alexander Severus (Froehner, Med. 177-178 <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cohen, Alex. Sev. et Orbiana, 3.
</note>), and on a fragment (22) of the Marble Plan; and is mentioned in the Regionary
Catalogue (<rs key="regio8" type="region">Reg. VIII</rs>). The structure was threatening to collapse in the
time of Hadrian I, <dateRange from="727" to="795">772-795 A.D.</dateRange> (<bibl>LPD i. 512</bibl>, 522).</p>
<p>Its situation with respect to other buildings and the contour of the
ground led to the adoption of a plan which made this structure unique
among Roman temples (FUR  fr. 22). Instead of having the usual
proportions, the cella of the Augustan temple was 45 metres wide and
only 24 deep, while the pronaos was only 34 metres wide and 14 deep,
and therefore did not extend across the whole front of the cella. The
<pb n="140"/>
back wall of the cella abutted against the front of the Tabularium, and
a very wide flight of steps led down from the pronaos to the area. So
far as investigations have been carried, they seem to show that the ground
plan of the temple of Opimius was similar to that of Tiberius (see Van
Buren, <bibl>CR 1906, 82-84</bibl>, 184 f. for such an investigation, and the traces
of successive structures-II being doubtful-and compare TF 47-49).
The interior of the Augustan cella was surrounded by a row of white
marble columns, standing on a low shelf which projected from the main
wall. This wall contained eleven niches, in the central one of which,
opposite the entrance, a statue of Concord must have stood. The
exterior of the temple was entirely covered with marble, and the building
must have been one of the most beautiful in Rome.</p>
<p>The existing remains consist of the concrete core of the podium,
much of which belongs to the construction of <date value="-121">121 B.C.</date>, and is probably the
oldest known concrete in the city (<bibl>AJA 1912, 244</bibl>, 245); the threshold
of the main entrance, composed of two blocks of Porta Santa marble,
together 7 metres long; a very few fragments of the marble pavement
of the cella and the pronaos; and a part of the magnincent cornice, now
in the Tabularium, together with numerous small architectural fragments.
The bases were also very fine--the only perfect example is in the Berlin
museum (No. 1013; cf. PBS ii. No. 126b-not 105d). For the cornice,
see Toeb. i. pl. vi., vii. pp. 42-51). In the podium are two chambers which
may have been store-rooms for treasure.</p>

<p> an altar of Consus, an Italic deity of agriculture and the
underworld, whose cult was one of the most ancient in the city and
localised in the valley between the Aventine and Palatine. It was perhaps
dedicated on 1st January, under which date it appears to be mentioned
in Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 83</bibl>. When the circus Maximus finally occupied
the entire valley, the altar was near the primae metae, that is, at the
south-east end of the permanent spina (Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 20</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 3</bibl> :
<foreign xml:lang="greek">bwmo\s *kw/nsou</foreign>; Tert. de spect. 5. 8). It is named by Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>)
as one of the corners of the Palatine <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref> (q.v.). This altar was
underground, and covered except at festivals (7th July, 21st August,
15th December), when it was exposed and sacrifices offered on it (Varro,

For a theory that the primae metae and the shrine of <ref target="murcia" n="U">MURCIA</ref> (q.v.)
were at the north-west end of the carceres, and that a brick receptacle,

<p> a hall of assembly on the Capitoline hill, where, before
the publication of the calendar, on the Kalends of each month the
pontifex minor made a public announcement of the day on which the
Nones would fall (Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 27</bibl>; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 654</bibl>; Macrob. <bibl>Sat.

derived from <foreign xml:lang="la">calare</foreign> (locc. citt.; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 13</bibl>), both because the pontifex
called the people together (comitia calata), and because he called out the
day of the Nones. As curia was regularly used in early times for halls
where the representatives of the curiae, or the senate, assembled, it
seems probable that originally this curia bore the same relation to the
senate and comitia Calata that the curia Hostilia did to the senate and
comitia Curiata (Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsrecht iii. 868</bibl>, 914, 927; cf. <bibl>Liv.

minor sacrificed here to Juno on the Kalends of each month. It was

<p>According to what we know of the republican buildings which surrounded the comitium, the curia Hostilia should have faced due south

either that it was necessarily orientated in the same way as the curia
Iulia (Jord. 1. 2. 327), or, more probably, that it lay further north.</p>
<p>As to its orientation, however, we must note that (a) that of the
<ref target="rostra-vetera" n="U">ROSTRA VETERA</ref>  (q.v.) varied  considerably at different times (see
<ref target="comitium" n="U">COMITIUM</ref>, p. 135), (b) that a flight of tufa steps 1.24 metre high, on
practically the same orientation as that of the curia Iulia, leads down to
the second level of the comitium (10.85 to 10.90 metres above sea-level),
which may belong to an earlier curia (Pl. 235, fig. 49) ; (c) that the fine
travertine pavement generally attributed to Faustus Sulla has quite a
different orientation from either. See <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 328-332; <bibl>Mitt. 1893,

just before his assassination and continued by the triumvirs (Cass. <bibl>Dio

(Varro ap. <bibl>Gell. xiv. 7</bibl>. 7). See also <bibl>CIL vi. 877</bibl>a (=32324), 1718, 32326

Augustus set up in it a statue of Victory (<bibl>Dio li. 22</bibl> ; v. VICTORIA, ARA)
and built an annex called the <ref target="chalcidicum" n="U">CHALCIDICUM</ref> (q.v.). The Secretarium
Senatus, another annex of the senate house, probably also formed part
of the structure of Augustus, though we have no direct evidence of its
existence before the time of Diocletian.</p>
<p>The curia Iulia, like the older curia, was built in comitio (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxv. 27</bibl>, 131); in fact several senatus consulta which have come down
to us in their Greek form state that they were voted <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n kometi/w|</foreign>; one
under Hadrian, however, is more explicit (in comitio in curia, <bibl>EE ii.
273</bibl>, 282).</p>
<p>The curia as restored by Augustus is believed by Hulsen (Neueste
Ausgr. 12, fig. 7), who had previously (HC 51) connected them
with the basilica Iulia, to be represented in coins of <dateRange from="-29" to="-27">29-27</dateRange> B.C. (Cohen,
Aug. 122; BM. <bibl>Rep. ii. 16</bibl>. 4358, 4359=Aug. 631, 632; cf. p. cxxiii,
n. 4, where it is referred to the temple of Julius; while Richmond (<bibl>JRS
1914, 218</bibl>) wrongly refers it to a little shrine just outside the Atrium
of Augustus on the Palatine). The statue of Victory standing on a globe
which came from Tarentum is shown in the apex of the pediment, and is
represented on other coins of the same date (BM Aug. 622-3; Cohen,
Aug.  13; BM. <bibl>Rep. ii. 14</bibl>, 15. 4356-7, where it is wrongly stated to have
been placed in the basilica Iulia).</p>
<p>Domitian restored the curia in <date value="94">94 A.D.</date> (Hieron. 161 <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Ed. Schoene; so also Tiro, Epit. Chron. in Chron. <bibl>Min. i. 417</bibl> ; according to Fotheringham (p. 273) the date would be 89-90.
</note>), and it was no
doubt he who took the opportunity of dedicating the Chalcidicum to his
patron goddess Minerva, whence it acquired the name of Atrium Minervae
(Notit. Reg. VIII). This curia is represented in the famous Anaglypha
Traiani (see <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref>). It is perhaps also represented in one of the reliefs
of the arch of Benevento (<bibl>Mitt. 1892, 257</bibl>; SScR 194). The curia was
burnt down in the fire of Carinus, and rebuilt by Diocletian (Chron. 148),
and the existing building dates from his time.</p>
<p>We learn from <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> drawings (Lanciani, Mem. L. 3. xi.
5-21 ; <bibl>Mitt. 1895, 47-52</bibl>) that it formed part of a group with the Atrium
Minervae and the Secretarium Senatus.</p>
<p>The curia proper is a hall 25.20 metres by 17.61 metres, of brick-faced
concrete, with a huge buttress at each angle; the lower part of the front
wall was decorated with slabs of marble, while the upper part (like the
exterior of the thermae of Caracalla and Diocletian) was covered with
stucco in imitation of white marble blocks with heavily draughted joints.
The travertine consoles and the brick cornice which they support (which
are continued round the triangular pediment) were also coated with
stucco. A flight of steps led up to the entrance door, to which belonged
an epistyle bearing the inscription: <foreign xml:lang="la">[i]mperant[e... [n]eratius in... 
[c]uriam sen[atus]...</foreign>  The second line no doubt contained the name
of an unknown praefectus urbi (<dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange>). When the building became
<pb n="145"/>
a church, a metrical (?) inscription was painted over it, of which only
the first word, <foreign xml:lang="la">aspice</foreign>, is preserved. Over the door were three large
windows. A small portion of the pavement of the interior, of various
coloured marbles, was recently exposed to view, but covered up again.</p>
<p>The marble facing of the internal walls was destroyed in 1562 (LR 266;
<bibl>LS iii. 221</bibl> (for details, see Archivio Boccapaduli Arm. ii. <bibl>Mazzo iv. 46</bibl>. 10).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> There is a full list, with sizes, signed by Pirro Ligorio, of 29 slabs of porphyry and
150 of marble removed by the Pope's orders.
</note>
The brick facing of the exterior and the cornice were coated with stucco
to represent marble (ib.), just as was the case in the Thermae of Diocletian.</p>
<p>In <date value="303">303 A.D.</date> there were erected in front of the curia, outside the
comitium, two colossal columns, in celebration of the vicennalia and
decennalia of Diocletian and his colleagues in the empire. The first
base, found in 1490, is lost; but the second, decorated with inferior
reliefs (one of which represents the suovetaurilia, in imitation of the

<p>Near here are also fragments of a large base for a quadriga erected in
honour of Arcadius and Honorius after Stilicho's victory over Gildo in
Africa in <date value="398">398 A.D.</date> (<bibl>CIL vi. 1187</bibl>, 31256 ; <bibl>Mitt. 1895, 52-58</bibl> ; LR 261) and
another inscription celebrating Stilicho's victory over Radagaisus at
Pollentia in <date value="403">403 A.D.</date> (<bibl>CIL vi. 31987</bibl>).</p>
<p>The church of S. Adriano was founded in the curia by Honorius I
(625-638; <bibl>LP lxxii. 6</bibl>), who added the apse. It is called in tribus fatis
from a group of the three fates which stood near the temple of Janus
(<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 259, 349; <bibl>BCr 1912, 146</bibl>; HC 24, 26; HCh 260-261). After
this several bodies were buried in niches cut in the front wall, in the
concrete core of the steps, and in front of them, on the pavement of the
comitium. The doorway, 5.90 metres in height, probably remained in
use until after the fire of Robert Guiscard the Norman in 1087, when its
level was raised by 3.25 metres: and so it remained (with steps descending
into the church from the higher ground outside) until the restoration
of the church in 1654, when it was raised again by about the same amount.
When the ancient bronze doors were removed to the Lateran by Borromini
a few years later, various coins were found inside them, among which
was one of Domitian. Between <date value="1654">1654</date> and the <date value="1899">end of the nineteenth
century</date> there has been another rise in level of about 1 metre.</p>
<p>To the left of the curia was the <ref target="chalcidicum" n="U">CHALCIDICUM</ref> or Atrium Minervae
(q.v.) (the last remains of which disappeared when the Via Bonella was
made in 1585-90), a courtyard with a colonnade running down each side;
while to the north-west again was the Secretarium Senatus, a hall measur-
ing 18.17 by 8.92 metres, with an apse at the north-east end. An
inscription shows that it had been restored by Junius Flavianus in
<pb n="146"/>
<date value="311">311 A.D.</date> and that it was repaired in <date value="412">412 A.D.</date>, after its destruction by
fire, by the then Praefectus Urbi, Epifanius (<bibl>CIL vi. 1718</bibl>). The passage

<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 257, 258 to the apse of this building, should more probably be
taken to signify the south-western hemicycle of the forum of Trajan
(<bibl>BC 1887, 64-66</bibl>; 1889,363; <bibl>1899, 88</bibl>).</p>
<p>The ancient basilica of S. Martina, built in the ruins of the Secretarium
Senatus, is first mentioned under Hadrian I (772-795; LP xcvii. 51, 96).
It is called <foreign xml:lang="la">S. Martinae sita in tribus fatis </foreign>under Leo III (LP xcviii. 90;
HCh 381). It was restored by Pietro da Cortona in 1640 and its level
raised, so that the older structure (in which no traces of antiquity are
actually visible) serves as the crypt.</p>

known as Diana Aventina (<bibl>Prop. iv. 8</bibl>. 29), or Aventinensis (Fest. 165;
<bibl>Mart. vi. 64</bibl>. 13 ; Val. <bibl>Max. vii. 3</bibl>. 1), and the Aventine itself was called

octostyle and dipteral, surrounded by a double colonnade. It was
standing in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not. Reg. XIII), but no trace of it has

that of Diana at Ephesus (Strabo iv. I. 5) brought to Rome from Marseilles, and another of marble (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 32</bibl> : <foreign xml:lang="la">in magna admiratione

<p>In the Augustan period it contained a bronze stele on which was

<placeName>DIRIBITORIUM</placeName>
</head>
<p> a building in the campus Martius in which the votes cast
by the people, presumably in the Saepta, were counted by the diribitores,
or election officials. It was begun by Agrippa, but opened and finished
by Augustus in <date value="-7">7 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 8</bibl>). Its roof had the widest span of
any building erected in Rome before <date value="230">230 A.D.</date>, and was supported by
beams of larch one hundred feet long and one and a half feet thick, of
which one that had not been needed was kept in the Saepta as a curiosity
(Cass. Dio, loc. cit.; Plin. <bibl>NH xvi. 201</bibl> ; <bibl>xxxvi. 102</bibl>). Caligula placed
benches in the Diribitorium and used it instead of the theatre when the
sun was particularly hot (Cass. <bibl>Dio lix. 7</bibl>), and from its roof Claudius
watched a great fire in the Aemiliana (Suet. Claud. 18).</p>
<p>Cassius Dio (lxvi. 24) states that this building was burned in the great
fire of <date value="80">80 A.D.</date>, but also (lv. 8) that in his day (<dateRange from="200" to="225">early third century</dateRange>) it was
standing unroofed (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)xanh)s</foreign>), because, after its wonderful roof of great
beams had been destroyed, it could not be rebuilt. As it is impossible
that such a building in this locality should not have been repaired after
the fire of 80, we must suppose that it was a hall without a roof for one
hundred and fifty years. We must also suppose that it was very near
the Saepta to facilitate the counting of votes, but it is very difficult to
find a location large enough for such a structure near the Saepta except
on the south-west, under the church of the Gesu, where, however, no
traces whatever of any ancient building have been found. For this
reason, in spite of the fact that Saepta and Diribitorium are mentioned
together as if they were separate buildings (Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi. 24</bibl>), Hulsen
has developed the theory that it was really the upper story of the Saepta.
The masonry of the latter seems to be too massive for a one-storied
structure, and the enormous beams would be admirably adapted for a
hall like that which the Diribitorium is represented as being (<bibl>BC 1893, 136-142</bibl>; HJ 562-564). The mediaeval name Diburo belongs, however,

seeking water to heal his children of a plague (Val. <bibl>Max. ii. 4</bibl>. 5; Fest.
329, 350). It was also said to be twenty feet below the surface of the
ground.  On this altar were offered the sacrifices at the <foreign xml:lang="la">ludi Tarentini,</foreign>
which were afterwards merged with the <foreign xml:lang="la">ludi saeculares</foreign> (Liv. Ep. 49;
Phlegon, Macrob. 4; cf. Censorin. de die nat. 17. 8; <bibl>Zos. ii. 4</bibl>). The
altar of the time of the empire was discovered in 1886-1887, behind the
Palazzo Cesarini, 5 metres below the level of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele.
Two blocks of the altar itself, which was 3.40 metres square, were found
resting upon a pedestal which was approached by three steps, and a
large pulvinus belonging to it was also found (Cons. 13). Behind it
was a massive wall of tufa and round it a triple wall of peperino. Not
far away, in a mediaeval wall, were found large portions of the marble
slabs containing the inscriptions that record the celebration of the ludi
saeculares by Augustus in <date value="-17">17 B.C.</date>, and by Severus in <date value="204">204 A.D.</date> The

<p>the name of a notable structure in the campus
Martius erected by Domitian (Chronog. a. 354, P. 146), consisting of an
enclosing porticus, the porticus Divorum (<bibl>Eutrop. vii. 23</bibl>), and two aedes,
the <foreign xml:lang="la">aedes divi Titi</foreign> (<bibl>CIL vi. 10234</bibl>, lines 8, 10, 23 ; cf. HJ 565, n. 18) and,
presumably, an <foreign xml:lang="la">aedes divi Vespasiani</foreign>. Eleven fragments of the Marble
Plan (59, 167, 224; and eight recently discovered, <bibl>Mitt. 1903, 17-57</bibl>,
pl. I, II) represent the porticus (q.v.) between the Saepta and the baths
of Agrippa, and within its entrance, formed by a triple arch on the
north side, two small tetrastyle temples. These were probably the
two aedes of Titus and Vespasian, and the whole complex was the templum
Divorum, which seems ordinarily to have been known as Divorum (cf.
FUR; Chron.; Not. Reg. IX). The porticus was rectangular, about
200 metres long and 55 wide, with something over thirty columns on the
long sides and sixteen on one short side. It extended from the present
Piazza Grazioli nearly to the Via di San Marco,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. <bibl>LS ii. 129-131</bibl>. In <bibl>NS 1925, 240-242</bibl>, some remains found immediately to the
north of Palazzo Venezia are attributed to the south end of the porticus; but, as Hulsen
points out, this does not agree with the orientation of the porticus as shown on the Forma
Urbis, and also makes it too small. It is therefore probable that these remains belong to
some of the private buildings between the porticus and the Saepta which were orientated
with the latter (<bibl>Mitt. 1903, 23</bibl>).
</note> and contained a grove and
altar besides the temples. Stuart Jones (Quarterly Review, <bibl>Oct. 1925,
393</bibl>) believes that the relief of the Suovetaurilia in the Louvre (Companion
<pb n="153"/>
pl. 50) belongs to the 'high altar' of this temple. After the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth
century</dateRange> there is no mention of the structure, but its name is preserved
in the Diburi or Diburo of several mediaeval documents in connection
with the monastery of S. Ciriaco in Camiliano (HJ 564-567; HCh 243,
589). Many architectural remains have been found on the site of
the building, but not such as to permit of a reconstruction.</p>

<p>a temple of the Divi, that is, the deified emperors, on

<placeName>DOLIOLA</placeName>

<p> a place, probably within the limits of the forum  Boarium,
ad cloacam maximam  (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 157</bibl>), where earthen pots, doliola,
were buried. It was unlawful to pollute this spot (Varro, loc. cit.; Fest.
69), and the jars were said to contain either the bones of corpses or
<foreign xml:lang="la">quaedam religiosa</foreign> of Numa (Varro, l.c.), or the sacred utensils of the
Vestals (<bibl>Liv. v. 40</bibl>. 8) or other priests (Fest. l.c.; Placid. 32, Deuerl.),
which they buried when the Gauls sacked the city. In 1901 there were
found, at the south-west corner of the arch of Ianus Quadrifrons and also
at a distance of 22 metres from it, remains of small chambers arranged
on both sides of narrow corridors, which formed subterranean galleries
with vaulted roofs. These chambers were of small size, 1.95 by 1.80
metres in width and depth, with doors 1.80 high. Each chamber contained a seat across one side.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> They may be, like the building near the Regia, miscalled Carcer by Boni, a series of
bedrooms for slaves. Similar rooms may be seen in the Republican house cut by the
foundations of the Neronian arcades on the Sacra via (see <ref target="aurea-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUREA</ref>, p. 168).
</note> The floor of the chambers farthest from
the arch is 3.25 metres below the ancient pavement of the forum Boarium,
and 4.50 metres below the present level of the Via del Velabro.  The
construction of the galleries is that of the last century of the republic,
and they seem to be adapted for an underground prison suggesting the
<foreign xml:lang="la">locus saxo consaeptus</foreign> (<bibl>Liv. xxii. 57</bibl>), in which two Gauls and two
Greeks were buried alive in <date value="-215">215 B.C.</date> We have several other records of
similar human sacrifices in foro Boario, though Gatti, in spite of Pliny's
<foreign xml:lang="la">etiam nostra aetas vidit</foreign> (<bibl>NH xxviii. 12</bibl>), doubts if they actually occurred
except in effigy. This may also have been the Doliola itself, for the
<foreign xml:lang="la">ossa cadaverum</foreign> said to be preserved here suggest human sacrifices.</p>
<p>Von Duhn (Italische <bibl>Graberkunde i. 416</bibl>) considers that the probabilities are in favour of a site nearer the temple of Vesta (inasmuch as
Livy tells us that the Vestals hid what they could not carry with them
<pb n="154"/>
<foreign xml:lang="la">in doliolis, sacello proximo aedibus flaminis Quirinalis</foreign>, and fled with
the rest across the Pons Sublicius to the Janiculum), and that the discoveries of 1901 are of too late a period to have anything to do with
the matter. There is little doubt that the whole legend arose from actual
discoveries of prehistoric tombs along the line of the cloaca Maxima
(cf. <ref target="busta-gallica" n="U">BUSTA GALLICA</ref>, <ref target="busta-gallica" n="U">EQUUS DOMITIANI</ref>; <bibl>NS 1911, 190</bibl>).</p>

<p>* the house of Augustus on the Palatine, which served
as his residence subsequently;<foreign xml:lang="la"> habitavit ... postea in Palatio, sed
nihilo minus aedibus modicis Hortensianis, et neque laxitate neque
cultu conspicuis, ut in quibus porticus breves essent Albanarum
columnarum, et sine marmore ullo aut insigni pavimento conclavia</foreign>

domus excitavit, quam  fulmine ictum  desiderari a deo haruspices
pronuntiarant</foreign>). The house was thus originally that of Hortensius,
and close to the temple of <ref target="apollo-aedes" n="U">APOLLO</ref> (q.v.); and if we identify the latter
with the podium  on the south-west side of the hill, the house of
Hortensius will be that which is generally known as the house of
Livia. Augustus also acquired the house of <ref target="q-lutatius-catulus-domus" n="U">Q. LUTATIUS CATULUS</ref>
(q.v.), the site of which is not exactly known.
<pb n="157"/></p>
<p>We thus learn from Suet. that a part of the house of Augustus was
struck by lightning and the temple of Apollo was erected on its site-
in compensation for which the senate decreed that a house should be
given to him out of the public funds (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlix. 15</bibl>. 5). The
enlarged house must have been ready at more or less the same time as
the temple of Apollo; for on 13th January, <date value="-27">27 B.C.</date>, the senate decreed
that an oak crown should be placed over the door (Fast. Praen. 13 Jan.;
Mon. <bibl>Anc. vi. 13</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio liii. 16</bibl>. 4; Ov. Fasti, i. 509; <bibl>iv. 951</bibl>;
for a representation cf. the Sorrento base (Mitt. 1889, pl. x.; <bibl>1894,
238</bibl> sqq.; SScR 76), and Cohen, Aug. 385=BM. Aug. 126).</p>
<p>The authors speak of its great simplicity, and of a lofty tower
chamber, into which the emperor was glad to retire (Suet. Aug. 72,
73) and of an <ref target="atrium-vestae" n="U">AEDICULA ET ARA VESTAE</ref> (q.v.). The house was
destroyed by fire in <date value="3">3 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 12</bibl>; Suet. Aug. 57), and
Augustus only accepted pro forma the contributions made for its
repair.</p>
<p>Hulsen suggests that the older remains under the basilica, peristyle
and triclinium of the <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref> (v. p. 161) may belong
to the palace of Augustus (HJ go). But even if we accept his theory
as to the temple of Apollo, on which this depends, this is only possible
for the former group, to which, however, the rooms under the large
hall to the S.E. and the so-called lararium must be added-if they
do not belong to an independent house. And, as the temple was
founded in a part of the original house (see above), this would make it
far too large (Richmond in <bibl>JRS 1914, 193-194</bibl>). On the other hand,
if we identify the podium on the S.W. with the temple of Apollo
(cf. Reber, 382), the house of Hortensius purchased by Augustus may
well be identified (as Parker, Photo 2250, had already suggested) with
what is generally known as the house of Livia. That it actually passed
into her possession is very probable, from the discovery of lead water-pipes with the name Iuliae Aug(ustae) (<bibl>CIL xv. 7264</bibl>), which most
authorities refer to her. It has also been identified with the house of
Germanicus, the father of Caligula, where the murderers of the latter
hid themselves (Joseph. Ant. <bibl>Iud. xix. 1</bibl>. 15 (117)), e.g. by LR 149- 151 ;
cf. HJ 63 (but contrast the rejection of this theory, ib. 85, n. 109).
But only the identification with the house of Augustus suffices to
explain the fact that it was preserved unaltered down to the end of the
classical period, as though it had been an object of veneration (see
<ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref>). Water-pipes show  that it remained imperial
property at least until the time of Domitian (<bibl>CIL xv. 7285</bibl>-ib. 7265.
L. Pescennius Eros Caesarum  may be almost contemporary with
7264, the Caesares being either Gaius and Lucius or Tiberius, Drusus,
and Germanicus).</p>
<p>The house is approached by a small passage, accessible from the
cryptoporticus of the domus Tiberiana, which leads into a court,
<pb n="158"/>
most of which is paved with mosaic. On  the right is a small
triclinium, and next to it a wine cellar; and opposite the entrance are
three vaulted rooms, facing N.W. and originally lighted by large
lunette windows over the roof of the court. The paintings are similar
to those which in Pompeii are assigned to the second style, and (especially in the central room of the three, wrongly called tablinum) their
perspective owes much to scene painting (Mau in Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1880,
136</bibl> sqq.; Gesch. d. Wandmalerei 167-174; 196-205; cf. HJ 62 n. 62).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. also Mitt. 191, 6-22.
</note></p>
<p>The other section of the house (perhaps the front) was only reached
from the portion described by a narrow wooden staircase. At first
it consisted of a courtyard surrounded by a portico with rectangular
pillars, and rooms on two sides of it (N.W. and S.W.); the centre of it
was then filled up by a large room; then the portico was split up into
small rooms; and finally the cast angle was cut by a narrow cryptoporticus (<bibl>YW  1911, 10</bibl>), which has destroyed this front of the house-
if there was one. There is a lower story, as to which no information
is available at present.</p>
<p>On the S.W. are the scanty remains of a peristyle, at present cut
off from the rest of the house by a road which is not ancient, but the
result of restoration by Rosa <bibl>(who excavated the house in 1869)</bibl>, which
is identified as the atrium in which the senate met (<bibl>JRS 1914, 207</bibl>,
213 sqq.; Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 37</bibl>; <bibl>xiii. 5</bibl>. 2; Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. vii. 170-175</bibl>;
<bibl>xi. 235</bibl>). Its area is at least 14.20 by 15 metres, or even 22.70 by 20
(<bibl>BC 1913, 199-224</bibl>)-certainly not as little as 6 by 15 (DAP 2. xi. 13).
It was built on the remains of an earlier house, a white mosaic pavement of which still remains under the vault of the cryptoporticus.
This vault must have been set on the remains of the pre-existing
building, and, though provided with windows, was never cleared out
so as to be accessible. Further remains of both periods have also
been found to the N.W. and S.W., but no description is available.

articles.</p>
<p>It is clear, from examination of the construction, that what is now

<pb n="159"/>
architect Rabirius, which was only completed in <date value="92">92 A.D.</date> (<bibl>Mart. vii.
56</bibl>. 2: <foreign xml:lang="la">(Rabiri) Parrhasiam mira qui struis arte domum</foreign>; cf. x. 71, a
poem on his parents' death). The cornices have two rings between the
dentils, a characteristic of Domitian's work (<bibl>BC 1918, 35</bibl>).</p>
<p>Two fragments of a marble epistyle, bearing an inscription in letters
once filled with bronze, which now lie at the main entrance of the
palace and were doubtless found there, are attributed to the reign of
Vespasian (CILvi. 31496a) but might betterbe assigned to the beginning
of that of Domitian (<dateRange from="81" to="83">81-83 A.D.</dateRange>). The inscription may have related
to the construction of a porticus. The building is described by Martial,
writing in <date value="93">93 A.D.</date>, as a lofty pile (viii. 36) ; in ib. 39 he alludes to the
completion of the triclinium, of which Statius (<bibl>Silv. iv. 2</bibl>) also speaks,
in a poem of extravagant praise; cf. also <bibl>Mart. i. 70</bibl>; <bibl>viii. 60</bibl>; <bibl>ix.
13</bibl>, 79; <bibl>xii. 15</bibl>.</p>
<p>Suetonius (Dom. 14) tells us that Domitian had the walls of the
porticoes in which he usually walked lined with selenite (phengites
lapis), so that he would see what was going on behind him; but otherwise we have little definite information, and practically nothing about
the fate of the building after his time.</p>
<p>All the accounts we have are too vague to be referred to this particular palace (see <ref target="palatinus-mons" n="U">PALATINUS MONS</ref>), and many of them (in Hist. Aug.)
have been doubted by v. Domaszewski; see <ref target="lavacrum-plautiani" n="U">LAVACRUM PLAUTIANI</ref>,
<ref target="elagabalus-templum" n="U">TEMPLUM ELAGABALI</ref>, <ref target="elagabalus-templum" n="U">DIAETAE MAMMAEAE</ref>, <ref target="sicilia" n="U">SICILIA</ref>, <ref target="elagabalus-templum" n="U">STABULUM</ref>, etc.</p>
<p>In Christian times the edges of the hill were occupied by churches,
but the central portion (perhaps owing to the destruction caused by
the earthquake of Leo IV) seems to have been almost entirely left
alone. Both the Anonymus Einsiedlensis and the writers of the
Mirabilia barely mention it, and we know very little about its mediaeval
history, though the pallacium divi Augusti described by Magister
Gregorius in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> (<bibl>JRS 1919, 31</bibl>, 52) is probably this
palace <note anchored="true" place="foot"> This is Rushforth's view. Hulsen, however, points out that the '<foreign xml:lang="la">Palatium LX
imperatorum</foreign> ' (JRS cit. 36, 53) must be the Palatine; cf. the reference to <foreign xml:lang="la">S. Cesario in
Palatio</foreign> in the list of twenty abbeys given by Petrus Mallius and Johannes Diaconus as
'<foreign xml:lang="la">in palatio LXX regum</foreign>' (HCh 232). The ' <foreign xml:lang="la">Pallacium divi Augusti</foreign>' is more likely to be
near the Lateran, as the connection of the aqueduct with the Porta Asinaria shows; while
the inscription is a mere fabrication.
</note> (it is to be noted that he connects the aqueduct with it) and that
the main aqueduct is spoken of as still running, though the distributing
pipes are not.; and the inscription that he says he saw among the ruins,
<foreign xml:lang="la">domus divi Augusti clementissimi</foreign>, may belong either to Domitian's
restoration or to a later one.</p>
<p>The palace of Domitian may be said to occupy the whole of the
south-eastern half of the hill-the Palatium. It falls into several
sections:</p>
<p>(a) The first consists of a group of state apartments entered from
the north-west.
<pb n="160"/></p>
<p>The lofty facade was originally decorated with a colonnade in front;
but Rabirius's neglect to fill up properly the earlier buildings below
made it necessary for Hadrian to support it with walls projecting at
right angles (III. 5 ; cf. <bibl>AJA 1912, 238</bibl>, fig. 4), in which many of the
columns were enclosed (the same procedure was necessary in the
case of the so-called templum Divi Augusti). Underground chambers
were also constructed against the facade wall.</p>
<p>The state apartments are arranged round a huge peristyle with
columns of Numidian marble and an elaborate entablature; in the
centre was a large shallow open water basin.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> An octagonal maze has been reconstructed in the centre from rather insufficient
indications.
</note> The north-east part of
this court occupied the summit of the hill, as is shown by the fact
that the <ref target="mundus" n="U">MUNDUS</ref> (if such it be) is excavated in the natural rock; while
the ground sloped away towards the forum and the circus Maximus,
which accounts for the presence of earlier buildings (see above) under
the halls to the north-east and south-west of the peristyle. Domitian
abandoned the use of this lower level, and all the state apartments are
on the level of the peristyle, which was entered between lobbies (a
latrine is distinguishable) from the north-west, where the main door
of the palace was.</p>
<p>Of these halls, that at the north angle has the form of a basilica,
though there was certainly no clerestory. It was too lofty to sustain
the weight of its roof, and the apse has been thickened and piers inserted
in the two angles at the other end. Outside the basilica the branch
from  the cryptoporticus of the <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref> (q.v.) reaches the
peristyle.</p>
<p>The next hall, almost square in plan, had a span of about 100 feet,
and niches for statues in the walls. For the frieze, see Me1. 1921-2,
303-318 (trophies with allusions to Domitian's triumphs over the
Chatti and the Dacians). The third hall, the so-called lararium, is a
good deal smaller. Adjacent to it is the only staircase ascending to the
upper floor of which we have any trace.  On the south of the
peristyle is the triclinium, which, as Statius tells us, was a room of great
size, decorated with a variety of coloured marbles. It is not certain
whether it was vaulted or roofed with a flat roof. Fragments of the
huge columns of grey granite which stood in the opening towards
the peristyle (as well as round the interior) and of the entablature
which rested on them may still be seen, as also portions of its marble
pavement.  It was flanked by a nymphaeum  on each side, which
originally opened on to it by means of large windows; but these were
filled up before the interior of the triclinium was faced with marble
for the last time, as it has come down to us.</p>
<p>Under the basilica are remains of a house of the very early empire,

<pb n="161"/>
which cuts through still earlier buildings. It was first excavated in
1724, and drawings of the paintings on its walls were made (<bibl>Mitt. 1895,
257-260</bibl>; HJ 90, n. 117, who thinks it may have formed part of the
older domus Augustiana; PBS vii. p. 58, Nos. 3, 4; Egger, Krit.
Verzeichniss der Handzeichnungen in Wien, Nos. 110-113). It was in
turn destroyed by the construction of a water-cistern with five chambers,
to which Boni (<bibl>JRS 1913, 246-247</bibl>, cf. <bibl>YW 1912, 11</bibl>) wrongly referred
the statement of Suetonius, Nero 31: 'we are told by Suetonius
that Nero caused sea-water to be brought from the sea to the Palatine,'
which really concerns the domus Aurea. Finally Domitian sunk his
foundations through the whole group of buildings when he raised
the general level of this part of the imperial palace (ZA 202, 203, 205).</p>
<p>Under the 'lararium ' Boni discovered the remains of a house of
the <dateRange from="-99" to="-1">first century B.C.</dateRange>, which he wrongly attributed to Catiline, below
which were terra-cottas of two still earlier houses (<dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third</dateRange> and <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth century B.C.</dateRange>). The lower floor, accessible by a staircase, and originally
lighted mainly from the north-east (where, under the foundations of the
platform of the palace, other remains may still be seen), consists of a
number of small rooms, with paintings of a transitional period between
the first and second Pompeian styles, in which columns have begun
to make their appearance, and there is an attempt at perspective.
The pavements are of simple mosaic. One room also has a fine
lunette with two griffins in high stucco relief. Scanty remains of the
pavements of the upper story may be seen some 6 feet below the level
of the floor of the 'lararium '; in some cases marble pavements have
been laid over them (<bibl>JRS 1913, 248</bibl>; ZA 204).</p>
<p>The portion of the site to the south-west of the triclinium lies
outside the main group. On the upper level are two apsidal halls
lying side by side, also belonging to the time of Domitian, and by some
supposed to be restorations of his day of the Greek and Latin libraries
of the temple of Apollo, the orientation of which they follow (<bibl>JRS
1914, 204</bibl>).</p>
<p>Halfway down the hill, and built against it, is a group of chambers
of the same period with a semicircular exedra in the centre, in front
of which is a row of columns. Below the line of columns the excavations have not been completed, and the plan is therefore uncertain-
for a room belonging to the lower floor, see <bibl>PBS viii. 91-103</bibl>. The
only information we have is from the numerous inscriptions scratched
on the walls. The fact that in one of the larger rooms a list of valuable
garments occurs, makes it likely that the building served for the
keepers of the imperial robes. In two of the smaller and darker rooms,
however, the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">exit de paedagogio</foreign> occurs several times. Paedagogium  might well be interpreted as a euphemism  for prison (cf.
Garrucci; Graffites de Pompei <bibl>(Paris 1856)</bibl>, pls. 12: 25, 30, 31; Storia
dell' Arte <bibl>Cristiana vi. 135-140</bibl>; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1857, 276</bibl>; <bibl>1882, 217</bibl> ff.;

Boissier, 1903, 303-306; HJ 92, n. 118a; and for the famous graffito
of the Crucifixion, cf. HF 1669; PT 169). Still lower down the hill
is a private house at a different orientation, belonging to the Severan
period or a little later, containing some interesting paintings (described
and illustrated PBS cit.). It cannot be identified with the <ref target="gelotiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS
GELOTIANA</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>(b) The second section of the palace lies to the south-east of the first,
and appears to have contained the residential apartments. From a
curved terrace on the south-west a large arched opening (now closed,
but visible in drawings of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> (Ill. 18); cf. esp.
<bibl>Heemskerck ii. 92</bibl> , 93; Wyngaerde's panorama repr. in <bibl>Mel. 1906,
179</bibl>, pls. iv.-vii.) led into a courtyard, surrounded by a colonnade,
behind which were rooms of elaborate plan.</p>
<p>They were excavated and plundered at the <date value="1799">end of the eighteenth
century</date> (Guattani, Mon. Ined. 1785 passim; the plans are not altogether
correct), and were then filled up again. Three rooms on the north-east
side of the peristyle are accessible: the central one has an interesting
barrel vault (not a dome with spherical pendentives, as Rivoira, RA
108-109, thinks), while those on each side are octagonal and domed. The
construction, again, belongs to the period of Domitian, though the
brick-stamps betoken later restoration (<bibl>NS 1893, 358</bibl>, 419).  From the
north-western side of the peristyle passages lead through a great
staircase with a large light well in the centre (from which light was
transmitted to the surrounding rooms by means of arched openings),
indicated in Guattani's plan, which leads on to the level of the triclinium.
There is no trace of the corresponding staircase on the south-east;
and his plan is apparently incorrect on this side, at any rate on the
lower level. For from it a staircase of quite a different form led up
to the second order of the ' <foreign xml:lang="la">Hippodromus</foreign> ' or '<foreign xml:lang="la"> Stadium</foreign>,' which blocked
completely the passage which the modern visitor uses, but which
did not exist in ancient times. The Villa Mills, once more, lies on a
mass of solid rock, and there is no lower floor under it. It is built into
the walls of this section of the palace, the plan of which is somewhat
difficult to determine. The excavations made in the garden, both in
1869 (Gaz. <bibl>Arch. 1888, 143</bibl>, and pl. xxi.; Coll. Lampue No. 258)
and recently, and the evidence of the Marble Plan are sufficient to
prove that it extended over the whole garden, and that the temple of
Apollo cannot have stood there.</p>
<p>(c) The third section of the palace is the hippodromus Palatii, as
it is called in Acta S. Sebastiani (Acta SS. 20 <bibl>Jan. ii. 278</bibl>) :<foreign xml:lang="la"> Diocletianus
iussit eum in hippodromo Palatii duci et tamdiu fustigari quamdiu
spiritum  exhalaret</foreign>.  The name hippodromus was already in vogue
in the time of Pliny the younger (cf. <bibl>Ep. v. 6</bibl>. 19, 40) for a garden in the
<pb n="163"/>
shape of a (circus or) stadium, as this building is generally called
(Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1895, 129-143</bibl>; <bibl>Ausonia 1909, 72</bibl>), and traces of the
edgings of the paths, in white marble, are to be seen, and of a gutter
in the same material outside the arcades.</p>
<p>It is a long, narrow area, 160 metres long and 50 wide, the north-east
end of which is straight (above it is a fountain, not a library as was
previously thought) and the south-west curved. The rooms at the former
end supported a balcony.  They have coffered ceilings, but were
almost entirely closed at a later date. The rooms outside the latter
end may be connected with the imperial tribune for viewing the
performances in the circus Maximus.</p>
<p>The open space in the centre had a semicircular fountain at each
end. It was enclosed by arcades with projecting half columns of brick,
faced with porta santa marble (the bases and capitals being as usual
of white marble), which date from the original construction of Domitian.
Above the arcades was perhaps a colonnade (but see the restoration
in Haugwitz, Der Palatin, fig. 10; some others, e.g. Pascal, also
omit the colonnade; and it may be that the granite columns <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Hulsen points out that there are only eight of them, all entire.
</note> which
are still to be seen lying in the Stadium belong to the church mentioned
below).  The arcades collapsed, and were restored by Septimius
Severus, who built counterpilasters all along the outer wall to strengthen
the vaults.  After his restoration at any rate there was no approach
to the garden from the north-west, but only to the top of the arcades.</p>
<p>On the south-east side is a huge semicircular exedra with a semi-
dome; this is generally attributed to Hadrian, on the evidence of
brick-stamps (HJ 95) ; but while the distinction between the work of
Domitian and that of Septimius Severus can easily be discerned (though
there are some points of difficulty, e.g. where a wall originally constructed by the former has been refaced by the latter; cf. <bibl>AJA 1912,
233</bibl>, fig. I), there seems to be no trace of an intermediate period.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Deglane (MA61. 1889, 213) is of the same opinion.
</note> The
lower part of the exedra was a good deal altered by Severus, but it was
not, as awhole, his work (contrast RA 165, 166, and cf. <bibl>JRS 1925, 125</bibl>.
For the paintings, see Mau, Geschichte der Wandmalerei, 459; <bibl>Mitt.
1911, 147</bibl>; and for the graffiti, <bibl>BC 1895, 195</bibl>).</p>
<p>An elegant round frieze found in the stadium, with olive branches
between lyres and masks, belongs to some small circular building not
certainly identified (HJ 76, n. 90; PT 129; for a fragment at Milan,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> ItF 1263; SScR 63. It is identical in design (if not actually) with one of the fragments
drawn in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> by Dosio, Uilizi 203' ; see ?Mitt. IS95, 28-37, where they are
attributed to a (perhaps) two-storied tholos in or near the peristyle of the state apartments.
The building is believed by others to have been a temple of Vesta.
</note>
cf. <bibl>BC 1883, 202</bibl>). Two statues of nymphs or muses were found here ;
one is still on the spot; for the other, cf. PT III. Repairs by Theodoric
<pb n="164"/>
and Athalaric are vouched for by brick-stamps (<bibl>CIL xv. 1665</bibl> a, I, 1672),
and, perhaps in this period, considerable changes were made. Another
porticus was built across the hippodromus from  the north end of
the exedra, and a wall parallel to this porticus, from the south end of
the exedra, thus dividing the whole area into three parts.  Within the
southern division an elliptical enclosure was erected, the walls of
which were tangent to the cross-wall and the colonnade. The masonry
of this enclosure is of the latest period, and the walls, although the
remains are a metre high, have no solid foundations, but rest on the
debris of the area. This elliptical wall was strengthened at certain
points by spur walls extending to the colonnade. The only entrance
to the enclosure was at the south end, where two pedestals from the
house of the Vestals were built into the doorway. Openings, somewhat
over a metre in width, were made in the wall itself at regular intervals,
and within one of these openings is a basin or trough with two compartments. It is probable that this enclosure was a vivarium, built to
contain wild animals, a sort of private menagerie of the emperors.</p>
<p>The site of the church of S. Cesario in Palatio, <dateRange from="1150" to="1400">between the middle
of the twelfth and the beginning of the fifteenth century</dateRange>, has recently
been fixed by Hulsen about the middle of the 'stadium,' while from
<dateRange from="600" to="850">the seventh to the middle of the ninth century</dateRange> the name belonged to
an oratory in the Lateran palace. This does not mean that the church
on the Palatine was not of older origin ; but the frescoes of the Byzantine period in one of the chambers under the Villa Mills described by
Bartoli (<bibl>BCr 1907, 200-204</bibl>) must then be attributed to the monastery
connected with the church (Hulsen in Misc. Ehrle ii. (Studi e Testi
vol. 36) 377-403; HCh 232-233; <bibl>RAP iii. 45-48</bibl>).</p>
<p>Excavations have been made and recorded at various times since
1552 (<bibl>LS ii. 44</bibl>, 45, 83; <bibl>iii. 112</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1894, 6</bibl> ; <bibl>1895, 276-283</bibl>; Rosa,

(<bibl>GA 1888, 216-224</bibl>; <bibl>Mel. 1889, 184-229</bibl>; <bibl>Jalirb. 1895, 129-136</bibl>; Mon.

1888;  HJ 94-97; Pascal in D'Esp. <bibl>Mon. ii. 119-122</bibl>).</p>
<p>(d) To the south-east of the stadium is a fourth division of the
palace; the substructions, for a certain distance, belong to the period
of Domitian (for a painting in a lararium in them and for still earlier
remains of the time of Nero, see <bibl>Mel. 1889, 228</bibl>; <bibl>PBS vii. 120-123</bibl>),
while the superstructure (thermae) was in the main the work of Septimius
Severus, who also erected at a slightly later period the huge arched
substructions (Ill. 17, 19) which still tower over the valley of the circus
Maximus, and which must have once extended a considerable distance
further, right to the edge of the circus itself. Their constructive

<pb n="165"/>
peculiarities are worth noting (RA 163-167). The SEPTIZONIUM (q.v.)
was built to screen them.</p>
<p>Of the superstructure, which must have had a somewhat fantastic
plan, with rooms of irregular shape and form, but little is left. The
so-called tower of Theodoric is a circular latrine. Where the imperial
tribune for watching the races in the circus Maximus (supposing always
that Severus erected a new one), is to be sought, is quite uncertain;
while the story that Severus wished to make the entrance to the
Palatine from the via Appia, and that Alexander Severus had the same
intention but was hindered by ritual reasons (Hist. Aug. Sev. 24. 4), is
doubtful.</p>
<p>(e) The fifth section of the imperial palace is the huge rectangular
platform supported by terrace walls, which occupies the east angle of
the Palatine (111. 20). The identification with the ADONAEA (q.v.) is
doubtful, but the shape of the whole area (the Vigna Barberini, in the
centre of which rises the church of S. Sebastiano in Pallara) seems to
be that of a garden ; and its construction is probably due to Domitian,
though brick-stamps of Hadrian have been found (Nibby, Roma <bibl>Antica
ii. 447</bibl>, 473; cf. <bibl>RL 1909, 527-539</bibl>; Rassegna contemporanea, 1911,
No. 9; <bibl>JRS 1919, 186</bibl>; ZA 219-221).  Others place here the temple
of <ref target="iuppiter-ultor" n="U">JUPITER ULTOR</ref> (q.v.) or the temple of APOLLO (q.v.). For mediaeval
fortifications here, cf. RL cit.</p>
<p>That the Palladium was still preserved on the Palatine in the <dateRange from="350">middle
of the fourth century A.D.</dateRange> is clear from the inscription of a Consularis
Campaniae of that period, found at Privernum (Piperno), in which he
is spoken of Praepositus Palladii Palatini (<bibl>CIL x. 6441</bibl> ; Bull. d'<bibl>Inst.
1863, 212</bibl>). The regio Palladii<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The form Palladium is found in Deusdedit (<dateRange from="1000" to="1099">eleventh century</dateRange>) ; see <bibl>RL 1912, 768-772</bibl>.
</note> or Pallaria is distinguished from the
Palatium maius in the sources of the eleventh-thirteenth centuries;
and the church of S. Maria (or S. Sebastiano, as it is now called) de
Palladio or in Pallaria, with paintings of 970, still exists in the middle
of the Vigna Barberini, where Hulsen places the temple of Apollo,
in which he thinks the Palladium was kept (Wilpert, Mos. u. Mal. Taf.
224, 225 ; HCh 353-355).</p>
<p>On the south-west of the Vigna Barberini lies the church of S.
Bonaventura built over a large reservoir, which was supplied by a
branch of the <ref target="aqua-claudia" n="U">AQUA CLAUDIA</ref> (q.v.; see also <ref target="aqua-claudia" n="U">ARCUS NERONIANI</ref>), and
between it and the ' Stadium ' was a nymphaeum. Below the summit
of the hill on the south-east slope are remains of private houses,
attributable to the same general period.</p>
<p>Inscriptions of slaves and freedmen, including a priest of Mithras,
connected with the domus Augustiana, from  the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>
onwards, are published in <bibl>CIL vi. 2271</bibl>, 8640-52; cf. xv. 1860, 7246.</p>

difficult question, as no remains of paintings are now visible and the

(stagnum) in the valley later occupied by the Colosseum (Suet. Nero,
31, whose description of it is worth quoting in full: <foreign xml:lang="la">Vestibulum eius

great park in which the buildings were set is also emphasised by
Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. xv. 42</bibl> :<foreign xml:lang="la">in qua haud perinde gemmae et aurum miraculo

is writing in praise of Vespasian</p>

destroyed by Nero, and built anew by Vespasian ; v. Suet. Vespas. 9).
That it did not extend beyond the Subura on the north is clear from
the fact that the temple of Tellus and the portico of Livia continued
to exist; while on the east the horti Maecenatis, already the property
of the imperial house, formed its natural boundary.</p>
<p>According to Hulsen's estimate the area thus included amounted
to about 125 acres, while that of the Vatican, including the garden and
S. Peter's with its piazza, is about 75 acres. Rivoira, however, puts
<pb n="168"/>
the area at 370 acres, that of Hyde Park being 390. It would be still
further increased if we add to it the area of the long lines of lofty
arcades on either side of the Sacra via, which Nero transformed into
a monumental avenue of approach to the vestibule of his -palace.
See Van Deman, AJA, 1923, 383-424; Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. v. 115-126</bibl>;
the  northern  arcade  began  just east of the  basilica Aemilia.
It was interrupted by the road leading east of the temple of the
Penates, which passed by an archway (the so-called arcus Latronis)
under the north-west corner of the basilica of Constantine. The
northern end of the portico behind it has been obliterated by the
construction of the basilica. On the south the arcade began at the
Regia, and ran eastward up to the beginning of the <ref target="clivus-palatinus" n="U">CLIVUS PALATINUS</ref>
(q.v.), which thenceforward diverged from  the Sacra via at right
angles opposite the centre of the vestibule of the domus Aurea. It
followed the clivus some way beyond the end of the Nova via, as far as
the <ref target="arcus-domitiani-2" n="U">ARCUS DOMITIANI (2)</ref> (q.v.). On the south the portico behind the
arcade extended as far as the Nova via, on each side of which an
arcade also ran. The remains of these very extensive arcades and
porticoes are comparatively scanty, except for their massive foundation
walls <note anchored="true" place="foot"> These have hitherto been generally attributed to the period of Maxentius or even later
(AJA cit. 386 and reff., to which Atti 516 may be added).
</note> (see <ref target="porticus-margaritaria" n="U">PORTICUS MARGARITARIA</ref>). Most of the travertine blocks
of the pillars have been pilfered by searchers for building material
(especially in the time of Alexander VII, according to LR 211), and
very often nothing is left but their impressions in the concrete of the
later brickfaced walls, which were built between them when the porticoes
were used as horrea. The blocks hitherto attributed to the arch of the
Fabii (<bibl>NS 1882, 222-225</bibl>) have turned out to belong to the arcades.</p>
<p>The entrance to the vestibule of the domus Aurea was, no doubt,
opposite to the Sacra via-approximately in the position of the facade
of the church of S. Francesca Romana. It must have had a great
portico or peristyle (for it is also called atrium), in the centre of which
stood the <ref target="colossus-neronis" n="U">COLOSSUS</ref> (q.v.), a statue of Nero 120 feet high. It is
unnecessary to suppose, however, as Weege does, that the <ref target="porticus-miliaria" n="U">PORTICUS
TRIPLICES MILIARIAE</ref> (q.v.) are to be sought here. Porticoes, a walk
several times along which (or we may even say, round the whole of
which) provided a promenade of a measured mile, were in great
vogue among the Romans (see <ref target="porticus-miliarensis" n="U">PORTICUS MILIARENSIS</ref> and <ref target="porticus-miliarensis" n="U">PORTICUS
TRIUMPIII</ref>).</p>
<p>The construction of the vestibule forced the <ref target="sacra-via" n="U">SACRA VIA</ref> (q.v.) to
cross the Velia somewhat further south than it had done hitherto (though
the pavement of the Augustan Sacra via has been found under the
steps of the temple of Venus and Rome, we have no knowledge of the
buildings which occupied the site of the vestibule), and this road must
<pb n="169"/>
have been closed for ordinary traffic after <date value="64">64 A.D.</date> We may notice
that the route of Nero's triumph in <date value="68">68 A.D.</date> did not include it ; and the
arch of Titus was erected at the only possible point on the Velia. That
the vestibule lay in ruins until the construction of the temple of Venus
and Rome by Hadrian (HJ 17) seems unlikely, for we know that the
Colossus stood in its original position until he moved it.</p>
<p>Beyond the vestibule a view opened out over the great park
described above, and down on the lake, on the site of which the
Colosseum was built, which formed the centre of the whole: and in
the park around it, besides the main palace on the north-east, were
various smaller detached buildings, as at Hadrian's Villa.</p>
<p>On the Velia itself, to the north of the temple of Venus and Rome
and to the east of the basilica of Constantine, are remains of buildings
now covered by a garden, in which architects of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>
(Fra Giocondo ? and Ligorio) saw two oblong courts surrounded by
porticoes (M6e. 1891, 161-167; <bibl>Archaeologia li. 2</bibl> <bibl>(1888)</bibl> 498; <bibl>Mitt. 1892,
289</bibl>, 291 ; <bibl>JRS 1919, 180</bibl>). To the east a small nymphaeum, adorned
with niches for statues and decorated with sea-shells, was found in
1895 (<bibl>NS 1895, 79</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1895, 127</bibl>; LR 361, 362, who says that it
was in the same Vigna dei Nobili that the excavations of 1668 were
made, in which an interesting painting, perhaps representing the
harbour of Puteoli, was found; cf. HJ 322; <bibl>PBS vii. 57</bibl>, No. 2.
That this painting cannot be earlier than the <date value="150">middle of the second
century	A.D.</date> is clear from  the occurrence in it of the name
Balineum	Faustines). On  the Palatine we must attribute to it
the irregular curving concrete foundations which cut through the
remains of the <ref target="transitoria-domus" n="U">DOMUS TRANSITORIA</ref> (q.v.) under the triclinium of the
Flavian palace. Remains of the buildings round the stagnum were
found on the north of the Colosseum (<bibl>NS 1897, 59</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1897, 165</bibl>),
and foundations of others were recognised in cutting the drain from
S. Clemente to the Colosseum <note anchored="true" place="foot"> A fragment of one of the fountains, found near the arch of Constantine, is now in the
Museo Mussolini (Bocconi, Musei Capitolini, 293, No. ii).
</note> (see <ref target="castra-misenatium" n="U">CASTRA MISENATIUM</ref>).</p>
<p>But the main palace was situated further to the east, on the mons
Oppius, above the via Labicana, to the south of the porticus Liviae.
It faced almost due south, and occupied a rectangular area of about
400 by 200 yards. The plan (text fig. 17, p. 535) is not one which is
familiar in Rome. The central portion is built in the shape of a TT, the
two sides being inclined to one another so as to enclose a trapezoidal
court. The facades were decorated with colonnades; and in the
centre a large rectangular room (No. 60 in the plans) rose higher,
special emphasis being laid upon it-as in some of the Roman villas
represented in the landscapes painted in Pompeian houses (cf. esp.
<bibl>Mitt. 1911, 73</bibl> sqq., pl. viii. I).  Villas with a similar plan have been
found at Val Catena, on the island of Brioni, near Pola (OJ 1907, Beibl.
<pb n="170"/>
46; 1915, Beibl. 133; Swoboda, R6misehe und Romanische Palaste,
51 sqq.).</p>
<p>The wings are disproportionately large. Behind the facade of the
west wing is a row of long and comparatively narrow rooms, each
divided into two parts by niches, so as to serve as triclinia either in
summer or in winter.  At the back they opened on a garden with a
fountain in the centre; and behind it again is a long, lofty cryptoporticus, at the beginning of which traces of mosaic pavements, belonging to earlier houses on the site, may be seen. The east wing is quite
different in arrangement, and not all the rooms have yet been cleared
(an up-to-date plan of the whole will be found in ZA 136, 137). In
one of them (76) we see the earliest existing example of a groined
cross vault; while another (84) is interesting as being octagonal
in plan, with a circular dome having an opening in the centre. This
room appears never to have been completed.</p>
<p>The remains of this palace, which were damaged by fire in <date value="104">104 A.D.</date>,
were covered over and filled up by Trajan ((Ill. 16, in which the brick-
work in the middle belongs to Nero, the finer brickwork with opus
reticulatum, on the right, having been added by Trajan). The rough
brickwork on the left is pre-Trajanic, but of uncertain age), who erected
his huge thermae over them; and they have therefore come down
to us in a very fair state of preservation, especially as regards the
paintings, though those of the west wing, which has been more completely opened up, have perished since their discovery in 1811   ; whereas
those of the east wing, though known far earlier, have been far less
exposed to the air. The ruins indeed have been known since the
early Renaissance, and were visited by many of the artists of the time,
and by their successors right onwards till the <date value="1800">early nineteenth century</date>.
Many of their signatures are actually preserved, including that of
Giovanni da Udine, the assistant of Raphael in the Loggia of the
Vatican and elsewhere (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1913, 140-158</bibl>). The paintings
are all of them on a small scale (III. 21), with little figures painted or in
stucco relief, often with stucco framing, and they must always have
been difficult to see in the lofty rooms of the Golden House, to which,
though well enough suited for ' columbaria,' this style of decoration
seems to us singularly ill adapted; while the execution, except in a
few rooms (that in the centre of the whole building with the ceiling
known as the 'Volta Dorata' (Ill. 22), and that in which the Laocoon
was found-Nos. 60, 80 on the plans), is decidedly inferior to what we
should expect from what Pliny tells us of the artist who was responsible
for them, though no doubt, like Raphael, he had numerous assistants
(<bibl>NH xxxv. 120</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> fuit et nuper gravis ac severus idemque floridissimus

<p>For reproductions and a careful study of the numerous drawings
and engravings of these paintings, see Weege in Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1913,
127-244</bibl>, and Ant. <bibl>Denk. iii. 14-18</bibl>; cf. also <bibl>BC 1895, 174-81</bibl> ; cf.
<bibl>PBS vii.  4</bibl> sqq. (where the legend Palazzo di Tito is very often incorrect);
<bibl>viii. 35-51</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1911, 145-147</bibl>; <bibl>1927, 66</bibl>; Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. iv. 39</bibl>, 40.</p>
<p>The great reservoir known as the Sette Sale, which really consists
of nine great chambers side by side, also belonged originally to the
Golden House, as its construction and orientation show, though it
was later made to serve Trajan's thermae. Apparently rooms were
built on top of it <bibl>(' these vaults had buildings over them, for we found
at the top of them mosaick pavement,' Pococke, BM Add. MSS. 22980,
f. 15v, 16v writing about 1730)</bibl>.</p>
<p>As to the internal decoration, we are told that Nero collected
hundreds of works of art from all over the world (cf. <bibl>Pausan. v. 25</bibl>. 9;
26. 3; <bibl>ix. 27</bibl>. 3; <bibl>x. 7</bibl>. I ; 19. 2) for the adornment of the palace (Plin.
<bibl>HN xxxiv. 84</bibl>, who, after describing about 365 Greek statues, says that
the best of them had been used for this purpose). For the rest, the
coloured marbles were in great part removed by Trajan; and the
gems and pearls mentioned by Suetonius seem to have shared their
fate. Nor have the dining-rooms as yet come to light, which he describes,
with their ceilings of ivory plaques, through which flowers could be
scattered, or pierced with pipes for spraying perfumes-still less the
circular one which continually revolved day and night. Nor have traces
of either salt or sulphurous water been recognised in the channels and
pipes. Either there is much more yet to be found, or his account is
somewhat exaggerated. But the palace is sufficiently interesting as it is.</p>
<p>At the time of Nero's death the Golden House was not completed
(e.g. the cryptoporticus in the west wing had only its ceiling painted,
the walls having been only roughly plastered, and the pavement not
yet laid), and Otho at once assigned a large sum (50,000,000 sesterces,
or 500,000 Pounds for its completion (Suet. Otho 7). Vitellius and his
wife are said to have ridiculed it as mean and lacking in comfort
(Cass. <bibl>Dio lxiv. 4</bibl>), but this may have been only gossip.</p>
<p>Vespasian and his successors, who knew how unpopular its construction had been, vied with one another in restoring its site to
public uses. Cf. Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 52</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">in illa invisa et spoliis civium
exstructa domo</foreign>, and the last two lines of Martial's epigram after its
destruction, the rest of which we have already quoted:</p>
<p><foreign xml:lang="la">Reddita Roma sibi est et sunt te praeside, Caesar,
deliciae populi, quae fuerant domini.</foreign></p>
<p>He himself began by draining the lake in the centre of the park and
erecting the Colosseum on its site, thereby restoring the streets of the
<pb n="172"/>
whole quarter to public uses onee more. The works of art which Nero
had colleeted in the Golden House were dedicated by Vespasian in the
temple of Peaee and other buildings erected by him (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv.
84</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">ex omnibus quae rettuli elarissima quaeque iam sunt dicata a
Vespasiano principe in templo Pacis aliisque eius operibus, violentia
Neronis in urbem eonveeta et in sellariis domus aureae disposita</foreign>).</p>
<p>His son Titus ereeted thermae (q.v.) opposite the Colosseum ; but
the main palace must have still remained in use during his reign; for
Pliny saw there in <date value="79">79 A.D.</date> (the year in whieh Titus eame to the throne
and in whieh he himself died) the Laoeoon, qui est in Titi imperatoris
domo (<bibl>NH xxxvi. 37</bibl>). As in almost the next sentenee he speaks of
the works of art in the Palatinae domus Caesarum, the Golden House
must be meant; though there is some doubt whether the Laocoon was
actually found in Room 80 in 1506 (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1913, 231-239</bibl>).
There are also traces of alterations in some of the rooms at this period
(ib. 161). On the Palatine the fire of 80 (Suet. Tit. 8; Hier. a.
Abr. 2096; Stat. Silv. i. I. 33) appears to have destroyed what the
fire of Nero had spared, and Domitian was entirely oeeupied in
rebuilding the imperial palaees. As we have seen it is unlikely that
the vestibule had  been destroyed as yet.  Trajan had  hardly
completed Domitian's work when a fire in <date value="104">104 A.D.</date> destroyed the
Golden House (Hier. a. Abr. 2120:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Romae aurea domus incendio
Conflagravit</foreign>; ef. Orosius 7. 12) and hastened his intention of constructing his huge thermae (q.v.) on the site. A number of the
openings of the domus Aurea were walled up with concrete faced
with brickwork and opus reticulatum (see Ill. 20) in order to give
greater stability, and the rooms were filled with rubbish execpt for
the construction of the oratory of S. Felicitas there in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth
century A.D.</dateRange> Here was found a very interesting calendar <bibl>(RE  ii.
A. 1583)</bibl>.</p>
<p>The vestibule was finally destroyed by Hadrian in <date value="121">121 A.D.</date>, and
the temple of Rome erected on its site; and after that the Golden
House has no history. The regio aurea of the Middle Ages has
wrongly been fixed here (<bibl>RL 1909, 224-230</bibl>); see AURA. Owing to
the erroneous identification of the Baths of Trajan with the Baths
of Titus, the ruins were called Palazzo di Tito during the Renaissance
and in the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange>, though De Romanis, Piale and Fea
knew the truth as early as the 'twenties of last eentury. The history
of the excavations is given by Weege (op. eit. 137-140), who also
provides a full bibliography of drawings, plans, engravings, ete. (ib.
151-159).  See also LR 361-365; <bibl>LS i. 232</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 222-228</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 169</bibl>;

</note>
 (which, if this palace, as well as the domus
Transitoria, had been destroyed, he could not have done at all),
and, as the construction and  the brickstamps show, have been
rebuilt under Domitian.  Remains of an earlier house, in opus
reticulatum, may be seen on the north side of the hill facing the
Capitol, in and under the later substructions.</p>
<p>Caligula extended the palace towards the north-east (Suet. Cal. 22:
<foreign xml:lang="la">partem  Palatii ad Forum  usque promovit, atque aede Castoris et
Pollucis in vestibulum transfigurata, consistens saepe inter fratres deos,
medium adorandum se adeuntibus exhibebat</foreign>; cf. Cass. <bibl>Dio lix. 28</bibl>;
Josephus xix. II (71) certainly refers to the <ref target="basilica-iulia" n="U">BASILICA IULIA</ref> (q.v.)),
and thus made it into so imposing an edifice as to excite Pliny's remark <foreign xml:lang="la">bis vidimus urbem totam cingi domibus Gai et Neronis</foreign> (NH xxxvi.  III).</p>
<p>Of the remains of the original building of Tiberius we know practically nothing ; but scanty traces of the extension of Caligula down to
the temple of Castor and Pollux have been recognised in the course of
the latest excavations-a peristyle with a large open water-basin,
26 by 9 metres (in which a fragmentary inscription Ger]manici f. was
found, which has generally been referred to Caligula), in the centre,
situated behind the temple and orientated with the domus Tiberiana
-and higher up, of the reservoir, in three stories, by which it was
supplied with water. Of the stairs which must have connected
this vestibule with the palace on the hill above, nothing now remains
(<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 81</bibl>; HJ 85; <bibl>AJA 1924, 368-398</bibl>). The cryptoporticus
on the south-east side of the domus Tiberiana is sometimes attributed
to Nero (ZA 198; Mem. Am. Acad. v. pl. 62); this would account for
the break in the wall, where the branch to the <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>
(q.v.) goes off, which, of course, cannot be earlier than the time of
Domitian.</p>
<p>Domitian appears to have reconstructed the whole palace; the
excavations of 1728 on the summit of the hill brought to light some
fragments of columns and cornices, which appear to have belonged
to his time (<bibl>Mitt. 1895, 266-268</bibl>), and some similar fragments still lie
about the garden which occupies the site. Further excavations were
carried on here in 1860 ff. as to which we have very scanty information ;
the whole rectangle (about 100 by 150 metres) seems to have had a
large courtyard with pillars in the centre and to have been divided
into three approximately similar parts, to judge from Rosa's plan.
A great deal of it (more than is generally supposed) rests upon arched
substructions; and that these have, as is only natural, undergone
later repairs, is clear from the presence, a long way in, of a copy of the

<pb n="193"/>
brick-stamp-C1L xv. 1081 (<dateRange from="145" to="155">145-155 A.D.</dateRange>); but further investigation is
needed. For some fine pieces of pavement in opus sectile, see PT 183.</p>
<p>It is, of course, easier to study the outer extremities of the palace.
At the north angle we must attribute to Domitian the huge pile, on the
level of the forum, erected over the peristyle of Caligula, but on a
divergent orientation, which is commonly known as the temple of
<ref target="augustus-divus-templum" n="U">AUGUSTUS</ref> (q.v.) with the two halls behind it, often called the <ref target="bibliotheca-templi-d-augusti" n="U">BIBLIOTHECA TEMPLI DIVI AUGUSTI</ref> (q.v.), into which the church of S. Maria
Antiqua was inserted before the sixth century (HCh 309; Rushforth,
<bibl>PBS i. 1-123</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 74-82</bibl>; <bibl>1905, 84-94</bibl>; HC  161-180;
Gruneisen, S. Marie Antique <bibl>(Rome 1911)</bibl>; Wilpert, Mosaiken und
Malereien, ii. passim), but by others supposed to be a reconstruction
of the vestibule of the domus Gaiana (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. xxxvi. 1-36</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The two small openings in the back wall, one leading into each of the two halls into
which S. Maria Antiqua was inserted, are, however, as Huilsen has pointed out, no proper
continuation of a monumental entrance of this kind (cf. HFP 43).
</note>
To him  we must also attribute the reconstruction of the exterior
of the substructions of the palace itself, and especially the double-tiered
balcony above the clivus Victoriae-the so-called Bridge of Caligula
(<bibl>PBS vii. 1</bibl> 18-120 ; AJA cit.) ; the rooms behind it are supposed to be
guard rooms; see RA 63, 64; Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. iv. 46-48</bibl>; HFP 67, 68.</p>
<p>A single-tiered balcony of the same form continues all round the
exterior of the substructions as far as the east angle (JRIBA 1922,
p. 561, fig. 8: ASA 135: the type is quite frequent at Ostia).</p>
<p>Hadrian enclosed the 'Temple of Augustus ' group with a stately
portico, with arcades connected by half columns.  'At the same time
the lofty guardrooms on the slope above vanished, in their turn, behind
even more lofty vaults and arches, which united the palace above to
the new Atrium Vestae below, which is of the same period. As a link
to unite these two great structures, Hadrian also built the majestic
ramp by which one still ascends to the Palatine' ; (<bibl>AJA 1924, 398</bibl> and
pl. x (III. 23) ; the plans in LF 29=LR 155 and ZA 193 are less correct).</p>
<p>On the south-west side of the palace there are traces of work of
the <date value="100">beginning of the second century A.D.</date> (HJ 78, n. 96), especially in
the vaulted chambers described in <bibl>BC 1894, 95-100</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1896, 162</bibl>;
LR 148, and in the open fish pond above them.</p>
<p>The domus Tiberiana is mentioned in Hist. Aug. Pius o ; Marcus 6;
Verus 2, 6, as the residence of the emperors at that time (for the only
evidence of reconstruction, see above), though by <ref target="commodiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS COMMODIANA</ref>
(Commodus 12) the <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref> (q.v.) is probably meant;
and its library is spoken of by Fronto ad M. <bibl>Caes. iv. 5</bibl>, p. 68, Naber,
and <bibl>Gellius xiii. 20</bibl>. I (from whom is probably taken the false statement in Hist. Aug. Prob. 2: <foreign xml:lang="la">usus autem  sum  praecipue libris ex

or another had come into the possession of the imperial house. It
was destroyed by the fire of <date value="64">64 A.D.</date> and replaced by the domus Aurea.
No remains of it were believed to exist, until the excavations made by
Boni under the southern portion of the state apartments of the domus
Augustana (Flavia) led to the rediscovery of the remains of a sumptuous
and beautifully decorated palace in two stories. By some it is attributed to the <ref target="q-lutatius-catulus-domus" n="U">DOMUS Q. LUTATII CATULI</ref> (q.v.), but this will not agree
with the date of the construction. Others assign it to Claudius, owing
to the existence of a quarry mark bearing his name on a piece of cornice
found there; but it is a good deal more likely that we have to deal
with the remains of a part of the domus Transitoria (the attribution to
the original house of Augustus (HJ 90) will not hold, as the remains are
obviously of a later date) ; seeMem. Am. <bibl>Acad. v. 116</bibl>, 121, 122.</p>

of curved slabs of marble, as in the ' Maison des Jardinieres ' at Timgad
(II. 24). The wall opposite the nymphaeum is decorated with niches.
On the south-west is a room with extremely beautiful paintings-small
scenes from the Homeric cycle, within a framework in which blue
and gold are predominant. What little remains of the polychrome
marble pavement and wall facing shows extreme delicacy and beauty
(YW 1912, io-II ; <bibl>1913, 22</bibl> ; BA 1914, Cr 73). The irregular curving
concrete foundations which cut through the whole of this part of the
building belong to the domus Aurea, as they are certainly posterior to
the fire of Nero and equally certainly anterior to Domitian.</p>
<p>Two rooms to the north-east, wrongly known as the baths of Livia
(HJ go, n. 117), have been accessible since 1721; and their ceilings
have been frequently drawn (PBS vii. p. 33, n. 24 (cf. Egger, Krit.
Verzeichn. d. Handzeichn. in Wien, n. 114); ib. p. 60, n. 14, is there
wrongly identified with the ceiling of the second room, which is, however, represented by Ronczewski, Gew6lbeschmuck, p. 29, fig. 16, and
by Parker, photo 2227). Fine coloured drawings of both exist in the
breakfast-room of the Soane Museum in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. also <bibl>Mitt. 1911, 145</bibl> (wrongly called Augustan).
</note></p>
<p>Beyond these rooms is a very large latrine, which has been wrongly
thought to be the machinery chamber of a hydraulic lift, which would,
it is supposed, have worked in a shaft over 120 feet deep found not
far off (<bibl>JRS 1913, 251</bibl>). The dining-room with a revolving ceiling,
which Boni supposed to have been worked by the same machinery, was
in the domus Aurea (Suet. Nero, 31).</p>
<p>From each end of the nymphaeum a flight of marble stairs ascended
to the upper floor. Under the later triclinium only the bed of the
pavement is left ; but to the south-west and north-east its white marble
slabs can be seen, some three or four feet below the level of Domitian,
who reconstructed this part of the palace with only one story, abolishing
the lower floor entirely; while under his nymphaeum on the north-west
may be seen a remarkably fine pavement of opus sectile, which when
found showed clear and abundant traces of damage by fire. Close to
it is a room which once contained a series of fountains, the water from
which ran down to the nymphaeum below.</p>
<p>The piscina under the basilica of the Flavian palace is attributed
to Nero by Boni (<bibl>JRS 1913, 246</bibl>), who wrongly refers Suet. cit. to
the Palatine.  See <ref target="aurea-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUREA</ref>, p. 166, and <ref target="aurea-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>,

<p> a temple of the Syrian god, known officially as
Sol Invictus Elagabalus (MIist. Aug. Elag. 1. 7, 17. 8), erected on the
Palatine close to the imperial palace (see <ref target="iuppiter-ultor" n="U">JUPPITER ULTOR</ref> for a conjectural site) by the Emperor Elagabalus, into which he proposed to
transfer all the principal cults of Rome (op. cit. I. 6, 3. 4. 6. 7; <bibl>Herodian.
v. 5</bibl>. 8 ; Aur. Vict. Caes. 23. I ; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxix. 11</bibl>). It was dedicated in
221 (Chron. 147:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Eliogaballium dedicatum est</foreign>; Hieron. a. Abr. 2236),
survived the death of Elagabalus for some time (Hist. Aug. Elag. 17. 8),
but was afterwards destroyed by fire (Passio S. Philippi AA. SS. Oct. 9,
545; <bibl>Mitt. 1892, 158</bibl>), presumably before the date of the Notitia, in which
the temple is not mentioned (HJ 106; <bibl>RE v. 2221</bibl> ; WR 365-366; Rosch.

however, thinks (<bibl>SHA 1918, 13</bibl> A, 150-153) that there would have been
no more room on the Palatine, and puts it <foreign xml:lang="la">in eo loco . . .in quo prius

after this time, and as it lay between the river and the horrea Sulpicia,
it became a part of the system of quays (portus) and warehouses (horrea)

<p> a bronze equestrian statue of Domitian erected in the

devotes one poem (Silv. i. I) to a description and celebration of this
statue. It stood on the concrete base discovered in 1903 near the
centre of the forum (<bibl>CR 1904, 139</bibl>, 328-329; <bibl>BC 1904, 75-82</bibl>, 174-178;
<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 71-72</bibl>; Atti 574-577; HC 141-144; DR  479-482).  This
base is 11.80 metres long and 5.90 wide, and its top is 1.50 metres below
the level of the latest pavement. The mass cuts into the main cuniculus
and one of the cross-passages, and dates from the Flavian period. In the
top of the base are set three square blocks of travertine, in which are
holes about 0.44 metre square and 0.15 deep, which seem well adapted
to hold supports of some kind. In the east end of the base was a hollow
block of travertine (over which was placed another block as a lid), containing clay jars, in which were sand, stone, pitch, and fragments of
tortoise shell, and in one of them a small piece of quartz with a bit of
gold attached, but nothing suggestive of funeral gifts. There seems to
be little doubt that, as Hulsen thinks, the workmen who sunk the
foundations for the statue came on a prehistoric tomb (for the pottery is
identical with that of the necropolis near the temple of Antoninus and
Faustina) and that, inasmuch as its true nature was unknown, the pottery
was regarded as highly venerable and enclosed in the base of the statue.
So also Von Duhn, Italische <bibl>Graberkunde i. 417</bibl>; and cf. <ref target="busta-gallica" n="U">BUSTA

<p>The statue itself was undoubtedly destroyed in consequence of

base concealed under the pavement of the forum. Over part of it
Trajan afterwards erected a building (not the imperial tribunal) (<bibl>BPW

Divus Iulius has been believed to be that of this statue (<bibl>NS 1904, 106</bibl>;

To suppose either that so comparatively unimportant a monument
would have been restored and placed in front of the new temple, or that,
having been restored, it would so soon have disappeared, is almost
impossible; and it is far more natural to attribute it to a statue of Caesar
himself. See <ref target="statua-loricata-divi-iulii" n="U">STATUA (LORICATA) DIVI IULII</ref>.</p>

<div xml:id="esquiliae" type="entry">
<head>
<placeName>ESQUILIAE</placeName>
</head>
<p>* (A) the earlier general name for the <ref target="oppius-mons" n="U">MONS OPPIUS</ref> and <ref target="oppius-mons" n="U">MONS
CISPIUS</ref> (q.v.), the two projections from the high ground on the east of
the city afterwards known as the mons Esquilinus. Esquiliae is in form
a place-name and was so treated grammatically (Cic. de nat. deor. iii. 63;
de legg. ii. 28; cf. Madvig, Kl. Schrift. 299). It is derived from ex-colo
(Walde, Etym. Worterb. s.v. ; cf. inquilinus, and for fanciful etymologies,
Varro, <bibl>LL v. 49</bibl>; Ov. <bibl>Fast. iii. 245</bibl>), and meant ' an outside settlement,'
that is, the settlement on the Oppius and Cispius when that district was
still beyond the limits of the Palatine city. Von Duhn's explanation
(Italische <bibl>Graberkunde i. 468</bibl> sqq.) of Esquiliae as ' Nicht-Wohngebiet,'
i.e. necropolis, is tempting. He points out that it was devoted to this
use as early as the time of the Kings, though (p. 434) he also notes that
very few cremation tombs have actually been found--so far as we can
gather from the insufficient reports that are the only sources of our
<pb n="203"/>
information. In point of time its use is of course later than that of the
necropolis of the forum, belonging as it does to the period after the
enlargement of the Septimontium  into the city of the four regions.
Regio Esquilina was the second in the City of the Four Regions (Varro,
<bibl>LL v. 49-50</bibl>), and comprised the Oppius, Cispius, Subura and Argiletum.
Its eastern limit must have been the ancient necropolis which began
near the present S. Martino ai Monti (KH i.). After the Servian wall
was built, the eastern limit of the region probably coincided with the
wall, and the adjacent district beyond was organised as the <ref target="pagus-montanus" n="U">PAGUS
MONTANUS</ref> (q.v.). At the end of the republic the <ref target="puticuli" n="U">PUTICULI</ref> (q.v.) were
ultra Esquilias (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 25</bibl>). This region was well wooded at first,
as is shown by the several luci (Fagutalis, Mefitis, Esquilinus, Lucinae)
within its limits.</p>
<p>Esquiliae was the term in general use in the earlier period, at least in
literature. Mons Esquilinus is found only once in Cicero (de rep. ii. ii)
and for the first time, and is not used at all by Livy, Tacitus, Pliny,
Suetonius or Martial, but it was adopted by Greek writers, and became
common after the first century (<bibl>RE vi. 683</bibl>).</p>
<p>(B) the name of the fifth region of Augustus' city, which was entirely
outside the line of the Servian wall, and therefore contained no part of the
original Esquiliae. Of the republican Esquiliae, the Oppius fell in the
<rs key="regio3" type="region">third</rs> and the Cispius in the <rs key="regio4" type="region">fourth region</rs>. It is not possible to determine
the limits of this region in the Augustan period with certainty at all
points, but in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> its western boundary coincided with
the Servian agger and wall from the porta Viminalis to a point just south
of the temple of Isis, and from there appears to have run straight to the
porta Asinaria. Thence it followed the Aurelian wall to the castra
Praetoria, except between the amphitheatrum Castrense and the aqua
Claudia, where it curved out some 200 metres. Its northern boundary
was the street between the porta Viminalis and the gate in the Aurelian
wall south of the castra Praetoria. Of this area, most of that part
north of the via Tiburtina vetus was probably not included in <rs key="regio5" type="region">Region V</rs>
until the time of Vespasian (<bibl>Mitt. 1897, 150-151</bibl>). A large section of the
region was occupied by parks, horti (q.v.), and there were numerous
distributing stations of the seven aqueducts that entered the city at the
porta Praenestina (Jord. i. I. 183-185 ; HJ 254-273, 342 ; <bibl>RE vi. 680-3</bibl>;
<bibl>Gilb. i. 161-197</bibl>; P1. 444-474; <bibl>DE ii. 2158-2167</bibl>). For this reason the
Esquiliae are called aquosae (<bibl>Prop. iv. 8</bibl>. I, 58).</p>

<p>the early name of the western part of that spur from  the

</note> Fagutal is a substantive form from fagutalis (Varro,

</note>), and was given to this hill because of the beech
trees, the lucus Fagutalis, that covered it, some of which were standing
at the end of the republic. Fagutal seems also to have been used of the
shrine of Jupiter itself (Fest. 87: <foreign xml:lang="la">Fagutal sacellum Iovis in quo fuit
fagus arbor quae Iovis sacra habebatur</foreign>). The exact relation of Oppius
and Fagutal is not clear, for while there is a distinct differentiation between
the two in the description of the Septimontium  (Fest. 341, 348). this
separation is not so definite in the list of the Argei (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 50</bibl>).
Probably Fagutal came to be regarded merely as one part of the Oppius,
and was perhaps largely displaced in popular usage by <ref target="carinae" n="U">CARINAE</ref> (q.v.),

(<foreign xml:lang="greek">*tuxai=on</foreign>; cf. 1. 10. 2)). For the embellishment of this temple L. Mummius
presented Lucullus with works of art that he had brought from Greece,
and certain statues of the Muses by Praxiteles from Thespiae which stood
in front of the temple (Cic. <bibl>Verr. iv. 4</bibl>, 126; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 69</bibl>; <bibl>xxxvi.

chariot when celebrating his triumph in <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 21</bibl>), and
it therefore lay on the line of the triumphal procession. In describing
this accident Suetonius (Caes. 37) says, ' <foreign xml:lang="la">Velabrum praetervehens,</foreign>' but
we know no other details as to its site (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 486; DAP 2. vi. 262;

in the reign of Claudius and apparently not rebuilt. Pais (Fasti <bibl>Triumph.

temple (see <ref target="velabrum" n="U">VELABRUM</ref> for the misinterpretation on which this theory

It was said to have been the tree beneath which the wolf suckled the

to the Comitium by the power of the augur Navius (Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 77</bibl>;

lightning (Plin. loc. cit.: <foreign xml:lang="la">sacra fulguribus ibi conditis</foreign>). It was regarded as
a symbol of Rome's power, and any sign of withering as an unfavourable
omen which must be averted by the priests (Plin. loc. cit.; Fest. 169).
This happened in <date value="58">58 A.D.</date>, according to Tacitus (loc. cit.), who calls the
tree ruminalis arbor (see below), and says that it had sheltered the twins
840 years before. The probable explanation of this tree on the Comitium
is, that it had grown in a spot which had been struck by lightning and
therefore was left unpaved and sacred; and, as this spot was close to the
statue of Navius, the legend had developed that the augur had brought
it over from the Lupercal (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 264, 356-7 ; <bibl>RE vi. 2147-8</bibl>).</p>

evidently referring to the same temple, although he attributes its erection
to Ancus Marcius. That this temple was on the right bank of the Tiber
is shown  with  reasonable  certainty	by the calendars (Fast. Amit.

two such temples, one at the first, and the other at the sixth, milestone
on the via Portuensis, the latter close to  the grove of the Arval
Brethren.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Here were found four dedications to Fors Fortuna (CIL i². 977-80=<bibl>NS 1904, 366</bibl>;
<bibl>CIL vi. 167-9</bibl>; cf. <bibl>BC 1904, 317-324</bibl>).
</note> Both had the same festival day, 24th June.</p>
<p>In <date value="-293">293 B.C.</date> Sp. Carvilius let the contract for a temple of Fors Fortuna
near that of Servius (<bibl>Liv. x. 46</bibl>. 14: <foreign xml:lang="la">reliquo aere aedem Fortis Fortunae
de manubiis faciendam  locavit prope aedem  eius deae ab rege Servio
Tullio dedicatam</foreign>). This was of course on the right bank of the river,
but Carvilius' temple is mentioned nowhere else by name, nor is the day
<pb n="213"/>
of its dedication known. It cannot be one of the two temples of the
calendars, for they were five miles apart (vid. sup.), and there must, there-
fore, have been three in existence in the time of Livy, to any one of which
his notice of a prodigium in <date value="-2">2 B.C.</date> may refer (xxvii. 11. 3: in cella [aedis]
Fortis Fortunae).</p>
<p>Finally in <date value="17">17 A.D.</date> Tiberius dedicated another temple to this goddess
(Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 41</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> fine anni.. aedes Fortis Fortunae Tiberim  iuxta
in hortis quos Caesar dictator populo Romano legaverat ... dicantur</foreign>).
As the Fasti Esquilini at any rate antedate <date value="17">17 A.D.</date>, and as the day
of dedication was near the end of the year, not 24th June, Tiberius' temple
cannot be identified with either of the two temples of the calendars. If
our sources are so far correct, this made the fourth temple of this goddess
in Trastevere.</p>
<p>There are four later references to a temple of Fors Fortuna on the
right bank of the Tiber: (I) Plutarch, Brut. 20 : <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ tw=| dh/mw| tw=n [e/ran tou= potamou= kh/pwn a)poleleimme/nwn ou(= nu=n e)sti *tu/xhs i(ero\n </foreign>; (2) id. de

ad Ter. Phorm. 841:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Fors Fortuna . . .huius aedes trans Tiberim  est</foreign>;
(4) Not. Reg. XIV: <foreign xml:lang="la">Fortis Fortunae</foreign>.</p>
<p>(2) plainly implies that Plutarch believed that the temple in the
gardens of Caesar was built after Caesar's death, or at least after he had
achieved success; and (I) is consistent with this view. Therefore, if we
are to attach any weight to Plutarch's statements in this matter, they
must refer to the temple erected by Tiberius. (3) might refer to any one
of the four; and (4) to any but that at the sixth milestone from the city.</p>
<p>There remains to be considered Ovid's description of the festival
of 24th June (<bibl>Fasti vi. 773-786</bibl>):
<quote>

</quote>
Because of the plurals, munera regis (776) and propinqua templa (784),
this passage is interpreted by some as referring to two temples of Fors
<pb n="214"/>
Fortuna, that is, the two mentioned in the calendars, at the first and
sixth milestones, with one of which the temple of Carvilius either is
(Mommsen, Wissowa, Peter, Gatti), or is not (Hilsen, Otto) identified.
Munera regis, however, has no force in this connection, and lines 781 and
785 seem to refer distinctly to only one temple. If line 784 (propinqua
templa) be interpreted in the ordinary way, Ovid must allude to two
temples at least, and as two five miles apart can hardly be called propinqua, we must suppose that he has in mind that at the first milestone,
the old foundation of Servius, and that built by Carvilius near it, which
the poet erroneously regards as Servian. In this case also we must
assume three temples in Ovid's time, that at the sixth milestone, of which
nothing remains at present; one at the first, presumably that generally
regarded as Servian, to which Varro and Dionysius refer, and Plutarch
in de Fort. Rom. 5; and that erected by Carvilius. Both of these last
two were close to the gardens of Caesar, and might have been within
their limits, while that of Tiberius is distinctly said to have been in the
gardens. This fact may have caused confusion in later writers, and
Plutarch's topographical statements are frequently unreliable. The
theory that Carvilius' temple may have been replaced by that of Tiberius
is not supported by the language of Tacitus. There seems, therefore, to
be no escape from  assuming the existence of three temples near the
first milestone and the gardens of Caesar, unless there is error in the
sources.</p>
<p>One at least of these temples was in existence in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>
(Not.), and in this neighbourhood many small votive offerings in bronze
have been found (<bibl>NS 1888, 229</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 290-291</bibl>). The ruins of a
concrete podium  faced with peperino, with architectural fragments,
which were found in 1861, may perhaps belong to the temple of Servius
(<bibl>BC 1884, 26-27</bibl>; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1860, 415-418</bibl>). For the discussion of
these temples, and further literature, see HJ 644-645; Becker, Top.

praetextae (Plin. <bibl>NH viii. 197</bibl>), and regia undulata (ib. 194), so that its
identity was in dispute. Some believed it to be a statue of Servius, others
that of the goddess (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 571</bibl>; Varro, Pliny, Dionysius, Val.

in the campus Martius (Fast. locc. citt.: in campo), but the exact site is

of each day is owing (Cic. de leg. ii. 28:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Fortunaque sit vel Huiusce diei,

stood ad aedem huiusce diei in Pliny's time (<bibl>NH xxxiv. 60</bibl>), but whether

of war (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 21</bibl>), but he did not succeed in acquiring enough
land to carry out his original plan (Suet. Aug. 56. 2). Within the forum
was the temple of Mars Ultor (templum, aedes Suet. (Aug. 29), inscription

formed the essential element of the forum as the temple of Venus Genetrix
did that of the forum Iulium. The work was greatly delayed (Macrob.

opened before the temple was finished (Suet. Aug. 29. I), although its
actual dedication is said to have taken place on Ist August, <date value="-2">2 B.C.</date>, at
the same time as that of the temple (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 10</bibl>; <bibl>lx. 5</bibl>. 3; <bibl>Vell.

of.the temple of Mars, this forum was sometimes called forum Martis

</note>
in honour of the victories of Drusus and Germanicus in Germany (Tac. <bibl>Ann.
ii. 64</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 91</bibl> ). Pliny regarded this forum with the temple of Peace
and the basilica Aemilia, as the three most beautiful buildings in the
world (xxxvi. 102), and says that the timber used in its construction was cut
in the Raetian Alps in the dog days, considered to be the best time (xvi.
191). In fact, wooden dowels (see below) were found in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth
century</dateRange> so well preserved that they could be used again (Vacca, Memorie 89;
Mem. L. 3. xiii. 1884, 402). As might be expected, many works of art
were collected in the forum (Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 183</bibl>; <bibl>xxxiv. 48</bibl>; <bibl>xxxv. 27</bibl>. 93-94;
Serv. <bibl>Aen. i. 294</bibl>; <bibl>Paus. viii. 46</bibl>. I. 4), including a quadriga dedicated
by the senate to Augustus (Mon. <bibl>Anc. vi. 26</bibl>) ; and in the temple, which
was as magnificent as the rest of the structure (<bibl>Plin. xxxiv. 141</bibl>; Ov. <bibl>Fast.
v. 551-552</bibl>, 555-568; <bibl>Trist. ii. 295-296</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Ann. iii. 18</bibl>; <bibl>xiii. 8</bibl>; Suet.
Cal. 24). The forum was restored by Hadrian (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19),
<pb n="221"/>
and is mentioned in the Notitia (Reg. VIII and app.) ; the temple incidentally in two inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 8709</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="greek"> aedituus aed. Martis ultoris,
and a dedication to Silvanus by another aedituus in the Lateran museum</foreign>;
see <bibl>RAP iii. 462</bibl>) and elsewhere (Suet. Claud. 13; <bibl>Mart. vii. 51</bibl>), and
perhaps in the Feriale Cumanum under date of 12th May (CIL i². p. 229:<foreign xml:lang="greek">supplicatio molibus Martis</foreign>; cf. Ge'  xiii. 23. 2 and <bibl>Hermes 1882, 637</bibl>).
How long the forum was used for the courts is not known. Claudius
and Trajan sat in judgment here (Suet. Claud. 33; Cass. Dio lxviii. IO),
but the building of Trajan's forum probably diminished the importance
of all the others. Once at least Augustus celebrated the festival of
Mars in his forum on account of an inundation of the Tiber (Cass. <bibl>Dio
lvi. 27</bibl>. 4), and the Arval Brethren sacrificed here (Act. Arv. ad a. 59,
69) to Mars Ultor, Salus and the genius of the princeps (Transactions of
the American Philological Association, 1920, 124-133).</p>
<p>Augustus placed in the forum  bronze statues of all the Roman
triumphatores from Aeneas down (Suet. Aug. 31. I; Ov. <bibl>Fast. v. 563-566</bibl>;
Cass. Dio lv. I. 3 ; Plin. <bibl>NH xxii. 3</bibl> ; GelI. ix. II. IO; Hist. Aug. Alex.
Sev. 28. 6, where the statues are said to have been of marble) with the
name and cursus honorum  of each general engraved on the plinth and
his res gestae on a marble slab fixed to the wall below. Of these inscriptions a considerable number have been recovered (CIL i². pp. 186-202;
<bibl>BC 1889, 26-34</bibl>, 73-79, 481-482 ;  890, 251-259 ; <bibl>NS 1889, 15-16</bibl>, 33-34;
<bibl>1890, 318-320</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 247-249</bibl>; <bibl>1891, 94-101</bibl>).  Later, statues
of other persons, of varying degrees of distinction, were set up (<bibl>CIL vi.
1386</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Ann. iv. 15</bibl>; <bibl>xiii. 8</bibl>), and honorary inscriptions (<bibl>Vell. ii. 39</bibl>. 2).</p>
<p>In the temple certain formalities were regularly observed, i.e. the
assumption of the toga virilis by young men, the formal leave-taking
of provincial governors when setting out for their posts, and their reception
when returning with signs of victory which were deposited here, together
with other less important functions (Cass. Dio Iv. 10. 3-5; Suet. Aug. 29.2;
Cal. 44). It served as a place of safe deposit until some thief stole the
helmet of Mars (luv. xiv. 261-262 and Schol.), and was the scene of the
famous banquets of the Salii (Suet. Claud. 33 ; <bibl>CIL vi. 2158</bibl>; <bibl>LS i. 80</bibl>).
It is usually supposed that the standards recovered from the Parthians
were kept in this temple after its completion (Mon. <bibl>Anc. v. 42</bibl>), being
removed thither from the temple of Mars Ultor on the Capitol (CIL i².
p. 318).</p>
<p>The forum was rectangular in shape, about 125 metres long and 90
wide, and joined the forum Iulium on the north-east, its longest axis
being perpendicular to that of the latter. The regularity of this rectangle
was broken by two large semi-circular apses or exedrae on the south-east
and north-west sides, and also at the north-east end, where Augustus
had evidently not been able to get all the land he desired (see above).
Exactly in the middle of the north-east half of the forum stood the
temple, with its end abutting against the enclosure wall. The forum
<pb n="222"/>
was surrounded by an enormous wall, which served the double purpose
of protecting it against fire and shutting off the view of the squalid
quarters of the city in the immediate neighbourhood. A considerable
part of this wall at the north-east end, and of both exedrae, has been
preserved. It was originally nearly 36 metres high, and was built of
large blocks of peperino in alternate courses of headers and stretchers,
with wooden dowels (see above), but no mortar.  On the outside two
courses of travertine divided it into three sections. Travertine is also
used at other points of stress. In the part of the wall now standing is
one of the original arched gateways, Arco dei Pantani, through which
the modern Via Bonella passes, 6 metres above the ancient level (III. 25).
The inner surface of the wall was covered with marble and stucco. Whether
a colonnade and porticus surrounded the south part of the forum -within
the wall is uncertain.</p>
<p>Each apse was separated from the forum area by a line of four pilasters
and six fluted columns of cipollino, 9.50 metres high, which supported
an entablature of white marble. In the curved wall of the apse were
two rows of rectangular niches, the lower about 2.50 metres and the
upper about 15, from  the pavement.  The wide wall-space (about
8.50 metres) between these two rows of niches, which appears to have
been bare of ornament other than the lining, was probably masked by
the entablature. About 5 metres above the upper row of niches ran a
cornice, and above this the wall rose again for a considerable height.
In each apse in the lower row were fourteen niches, not counting the large
one in the middle, and four between each apse and the temple, making
thirty-six in all. Whether there were more in the other portion of the
wall is not known. In the lower niches were the statues of the triumphatores, and in the upper probably trophies. Between the niches were
marble pilasters.</p>
<p>The temple was octostyle, and peripteral except at the north-east
end, where it joined the forum wall (Petersen, Ara Pacis Augustae, <bibl>Vienna
1902, 61</bibl> ff. <note anchored="true" place="foot"> For the relief (formerly attributed to the Ara Pacis) in the Villa Medici, which has
often been supposed to represent the fa,ade of this temple, see Meded. Nederland. Hist.

</note>; <bibl>BA 1911, 300</bibl> sqq.). Three of the columns with the architrave are still standing. They are of white marble, fluted, 15.30 metres
high and 1.76 in diameter, with Corinthian capitals (for a restoration
of the capital, see Mem. Am. Acad. ii. pi. 2).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> And for the entasis, ib. iv. 122, 142.

Augustus. This theory has, however, now been abandoned by Huulsen
and Fiechter (<bibl>Toeb. i. 35-41</bibl>; cf. 51), for we have neither record nor
traces of any restoration.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Unless we attribute to Hadrian the smaller rectangular niche which was afterwards

</note> The ceiling of the peristyle,
between the cella wall and the columns, is coffered, with rosettes in the
centre of each coffer. The concrete base of the steps (III. 26) is well
preserved (though the steps are thought to have been relaid at a later
date), and so is a portion of the podium, with its facing of marble slabs
which shows signs of decoration with bronze reliefs. In the podium is
a chamber which was cut in the Middle Ages to serve as a burial vault.
A  courtyard behind the north-west exedra, surrounded by an arcade,
is interesting; and  the  north-west exedra  itself has been  entirely
cleared.  The work, which is still in progress, has not yet been fully
described. (For other literature on forum and temple, see <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>.

was, as its name implies, the cattle-market of ancient Rome. It originally extended from the boundary of the Velabrum (later marked by the

the valley of the circus Maximus to the road leading from the pons

<p>In process of time this large open space was greatly encroached upon
by buildings; but the name was still applied to the whole district. A
bronze statue of a bull (said to have been brought from Aegina) symbolised its purpose, and (according to some authorities) gave it its name.
It was an important centre of traffic, and had been so from a remote
period ; for the original route from the north and east (see <ref target="via-flaminia" n="U">VIA FLAMINIA</ref>,
<ref target="via-salaria" n="U">VIA SALARIA</ref>) came along the <ref target="via-salaria" n="U">VICUS IUGARIUS</ref> or the <ref target="via-salaria" n="U">VICUS TUSCUS</ref> (q.v.)

pons Aemilius), and here intersected the road which ran from the campus
Martius between the Capitol and the river, passing through the porta
Carmentalis and the porta Flumentana, and on to the porta Trigemina.
The road along the valley of the circus Maximus and the clivus Publicius
descending from the Aventine also opened into this narrow level space
between the hills and the river. Thus streets, in later days adorned with
porticoes, radiated from the forum Boarium in all directions (DAP 2. vi.
247-248).</p>
<p>This crowded area was often devastated by fire. It seems to have
lain for the most part within the <rs key="regio11" type="region">eleventh region</rs> of Augustus, but to
have also included a small portion of the eighth.</p>
<p>Two terminal stones (<bibl>CIL vi. 919</bibl>, 31574), one of the period of
Tiberius, the other of Claudius, show that the open space, which was
public property, required protection from encroachment, and define the
eastern boundary as running along the front of the <ref target="hercules-pompeianus-aedes" n="U">TEMPLUM HERCULIS
POMPEIANI</ref> (q.v.), which stood in front of the carceres of the circus
Maximus.
Of the temples situated in or near the forum Boarium the round
temple of <ref target="hercules-invictus" n="U">HERCULES INVICTUS</ref> (q.v.), with the ara Maxima close by it, was
the most famous; there were also those of <ref target="fortuna" n="U">FORTUNA</ref>, <ref target="fortuna" n="U">HERCULES POMPEIANUS</ref>, <ref target="fortuna" n="U">MATER MATUTA</ref>, <ref target="fortuna" n="U">PORTUNUS</ref>, <ref target="fortuna" n="U">PUDICITIA PATRICIA</ref> (qq.v.).</p>
<p>Among other monuments were the two fornices erected by L. STERTINIUS (q.v.). The BUSTA GALLICA and DOLIOLA (q.v.) were probably
primitive tombs, discovered (and misunderstood) in Roman times.

<foreign xml:lang="la">ubi quid generatim, additum ab eo cognomen ut forum boarium, forum
olitorium; hoc erat antiquum  macellum ubi olerum copia</foreign>), lying just
outside the porta Carmentalis, in the<rs key="regio9" type="region"> ninth region</rs> of Augustus. Its
south-east and north-east limits were marked by the Servian wall and
the slope of the Capitoline hill, and it extended north-west across the
present Piazza Montanara.  On the west and south-west it probably
extended originally to the river, but was afterwards diminished in area
and practically enclosed by four temples, erected in foro holitorio, to
PIETAS, IANUS, SPES and <ref target="iuno-sospita-aedes-1" n="U">IUNO SOSPITA</ref> (qq. vv.), and the theatre of
Marcellus. The ruins of three of these temples exist beneath the church
of S. Nicola in Carcere (for restorations, see D'Esp. <bibl>Mon. ii. 128-129</bibl>).
By the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange> the forum had been paved, and considerable
fragments of its pavement of travertine have been found between S.
Nicola in Carcere and a wall of peperino that crosses the Piazza Montanara,
for a distance of about 90 metres (<bibl>BC 1875, 173</bibl>). The details given as
to this wall are insufficient; but it is noticeable that Lanciani omits
it in LF 28 ; cf. <bibl>BC 1917, 168</bibl> sqq. and pl. xiv., xv., where he deals further
with the porticus in vicolo della Bufala. This peperino wall perhaps
marks the northern limit of the forum which, after it was surrounded
by buildings, was about 125 by 40-50 metres in area. Its eastern corner,
between the Capitoline and the Servian wall, was closed by a building,
apparently a large porticus, that has been erroneously identified with
the <ref target="porticus-minucia" n="U">PORTICUS MINUCIA</ref> (q.v.). Its ruins were found in the Vicolo della
Bufala (HJ 515; <bibl>NS 1891, 316</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1892, 292</bibl>). Other remains of
this portico, at a slightly different orientation, are also to be seen in Piazza
Montanara (<bibl>NS 1879, 314</bibl>). The forum was connected with the vicus
Iugarius and the forum Boarium by a street that ran south through the
porta Carmentalis (see in general, HJ 507-515; P1. 389-392; Richter

<placeName>FORUM IULIUM</placeName>
</head>
<p> the first of the so-called imperial fora, begun by Julius
Caesar and designed, not for a market, but to provide a centre for business
of other kinds (App. <bibl>BC ii. 102</bibl>).  The plan of this forum had been conceived as early as <date value="-54">54 B.C.</date>, for in that year Cicero and Oppius were engaged
in purchasing land for Caesar from private owners, and had already
paid sixty million sesterces (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 16</bibl>. 8). More land was
acquired afterwards, and the final cost is said to have been one hundred
<pb n="226"/>
million sesterces, about 1,000,000 pounds (<bibl>Plin. xxxvi. 103</bibl>; Suet. Caes. 26), a
sum perhaps exaggerated.</p>
<p>Work was probably begun in 51, during Caesar's absence in Gaul
(Suet. loc. cit.). At the battle of Pharsalus Caesar vowed a temple to
Venus Genetrix, the mythical ancestress of the Julian gens, and proceeded to build it in the centre of his forum (App. <bibl>BC ii. 68-69</bibl>, 102; <bibl>iii. 28</bibl>;
Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 22</bibl>. 2), which thus became in effect a porticus surrounding
the temple, a type followed in all the later fora. Temple and forum
were dedicated on the last day of Caesar's great triumph, 26th September,
<date value="-46">46 B.C.</date> (Cass. Dio, loc. cit.; Fast. Arv. Pine. Vail. ad vi Kal. Oct., CIL i².
p. 215,219, 240, 322-323, 330; Fast. Praen. in <bibl>BC 1915, 170</bibl>, 346), although
the forum was not finished by Caesar (cf. Nic. Damasc. Caes. 22; Plin.
<bibl>NH xxxv. 156</bibl>), but by Octavianus after the dictator's death (Mon. <bibl>Anc.
iv. 2</bibl> ; Cass. <bibl>Dio xlv. 6</bibl>. 4). In the forum Caesar allowed the erection
of a statue of himself wearing a cuirass (<bibl>Plin. xxxiv. 18</bibl>), and he himself
dedicated a statue of his horse with ' <foreign xml:lang="la">humanis similes pedes priores</foreign>' (<bibl>Plin.
viii. 155</bibl>; Suet. Caes. 61 ; Stat. Silv. i. I. 84-85), on which the dictator
was mounted (Ber. d. k. sachs. <bibl>Gesells. 1891, 99-112</bibl>). In front of the
temple  stood  a  fountain  surrounded  by  nymphs, called  <ref target="appiades" n="U">APPIADES</ref>
(q.v.). The forum was burned in <date value="283">283 A.D.</date> and restored by Diocletian
(Chron. 148). While the official designation was forum Iulium (Mon. Anc.)
it appears regularly in our sources as forum Caesaris (locc. citt.; Not.
Reg. VIII; <bibl>Plin. xvi. 236</bibl>; CILvi. 10097 (?)=33960; <bibl>BC 1915, 170-171</bibl>;
possibly Phlegon refers to this forum as  <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( (*rwmai/wn a)gora/</foreign>  (Mir. 13).</p>
<p>The temple of Venus (aedes, Livy, Pliny, Suet., Vitr., tempium, Ovid,

pycnostyle (<bibl>Vitr. iii. 3</bibl>. 2) and built of solid marble (Ov. <bibl>A.A. i. 81</bibl>).
The statue of Venus Genetrix by Arcesilas, which Caesar set up, in foro
Caesaris (<bibl>Plin. xxxv. 156</bibl>; cf. Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 18</bibl>. 4), was probably in the
cella of the temple.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See Weickert in Festschr. f. P. Arndt, 54-61, for the type as represented on a relief in
the Villa Borghese (Reinach, <bibl>Rep. iii. 171</bibl>. i), which he assigns to the period before <date value="-46">46 B.C.</date>;

</note> (For another type of Venus Genetrix (seated) on a
coin, see BM. <bibl>Rep. i. 583</bibl>. 4277.) Caesar also placed in the temple two
paintings by Timomachus, Ajax and Medea (<bibl>Plin. vii. 126</bibl>; <bibl>xxxv. 26</bibl>,
136); a gilded statue of Cleopatra (Cass. <bibl>Dio li. 22</bibl>. 3; App. BC ii. o12);
six dactyliothecae or collections of engraved gems (Plin. xxxvii. II);
and a thorax adorned with British pearls (Plin. ix. I 6). Later, Augustus
is stated to have set up in the temple a statue of the deified Julius with
a star above his head (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlv. 7</bibl>. I; <bibl>xlvii. 18</bibl>. 4; <bibl>Plin. ii. 93</bibl>),
although some scholars believe that this is a mistake for the temple of
divus Iulius in the forum  (see Jord. <bibl>Hermes 1875, 342-343</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb.

<p>A statue of Drusilla was erected in the temple after her death

<p>The forum Iulium was rectangular, about 115 metres long and 30
wide, surrounded by a colonnade and wall. Its main axis ran north-west
to south-east, corresponding with that of the curia Iulia which adjoined
it at the south corner. On this axis the temple was built, facing south-
east. All that remains of the forum is part of the enclosure wall of
peperino on the south-west side (Via delle Marmorelle 29), 12 metres
high and 3.70 thick, and some small vaulted chambers or tabernae
opening into the corridor of the forum through a row of peperino arches
with Anio tufa piers and travertine imposts (TF 46). Of the temple
of Venus, excavations in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> brought to light portions
of the foundations of peperino and travertine, and fragments of columns
and frieze (cf. Strena Helbigiana 139-142 and DAP 2. xv. 366).  At this
time Palladio (Quattro Libri dell' Architettura 1570, iv. ch. 3, 128 sqq.) and
Labacco (Libro appartenente all' Architettura, 1552, 25-28; 1559, 33-36)
drew a plan and reconstruction from what was then visible, representing
a peripteral octostyle structure with very narrow  intercolumniations.
A piece of the architrave still exists in the Villa Medici.  (For forum

<p>* the fourth of the imperial fora (<bibl>Mart. x. 28</bibl>. 6, 5. 12),
built by Domitian, but dedicated by Nerva at the beginning of <date value="97">97 A.D.</date>
(Suet. Dom. 5; Stat. <bibl>Silv. iv. 3</bibl>. 9-10; Cassiod. Chron. 140; Hier. a. Abr.
2105; <bibl>Eutrop. vii. 23</bibl>; Vict. Caes. 12. 2; <bibl>CIL vi. 953</bibl>=31213).  It
occupied the space between the forum Augustum on the north-west and
the forum Pacis on the south-east, and was in effeet a transformation of
the intervening Argiletum with its crowded and unsightly buildings into
a magnificent avenue which had the form of a very narrow forum. Its
length was about 120 metres, its width about 40, and the walls of the
fora already existing were extended so as to form a continuous enclosure.
A part of the wall at the north-east end is still standing and corresponds
in height and character with that of the forum  Augustum  which it
adjoins, except that the size of the rectangular blocks of stone used in
the construction has been considerably increased (from 59 cm. (2 Roman
feet) to 78 cm.).</p>
<p>This forum was officially the forum Nervae (Suet. loc. cit.; Lydus,
de mens. iv. I), but as it was the main thoroughfare between the Subura
<pb n="228"/>
and forum Romanum and the other imperial fora, it soon became known
as the forum Transitorium (Hist. Aug. Alex. Sev. 28. 6; 36. 2; Pol. Silv.
545; Cassiod. Chron. cit.; <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. also Chron. Min..  147 (Prosp. Tiro).
</note> <bibl>Eutrop. vii. 23</bibl>; Hier. a. Abr. 2o5 ; Serv.
<bibl>Aen. vii. 607</bibl>), or, less frequently apparently, forum Pervium (Vict. Caes.
12. 2). In Reg. it is listed in <rs key="regio4" type="region">Region IV</rs> as forum Transitorium, in<rs key="regio8" type="region"> Region
VIII</rs> and the Appendix as forum Nervae, which indicates the common
use of both names, and that the boundary between the two regions
passed through the forum  (Pr. Reg. 144).  Once it is called forum
Palladium (<bibl>Mart. i. 2</bibl>. 8), because of the temple of Minerva, but whether
this was in general use, or merely a conceit of the poet, is uncertain (cf.
also <ref target="minerva-templum" n="U">MINERVA TEMPLUM</ref>). It appears to be spoken of as Caesareum
forum in <bibl>CIL vi. 0097</bibl> =33960 (cf. <bibl>Mart. i. 117</bibl>. 10).</p>
<p>After the pattern set in the other imperial fora, Domitian built in
his forum a temple of Minerva, to whose cult he was especially devoted
(Suet. Dom. 15; Cass. Dio lxvii. I). It was dedicated by Nerva at the
same time as the forum, and was a magnificent and imposing building
(Vict. Caes. loc. cit.; <bibl>CIL vi. 953</bibl> =31213). It is represented on the
Marble Plan (116), and stood in the centre of the north-east end of the
forum.  From either side short walls extended across the fora of Augustus
and Vespasian. It was of the Corinthian order, hexastyle prostyle, and
its apse projected beyond the limits of the forum.</p>
<p>Besides this temple Domitian also erected one to <ref target="ianus-quadrifrons" n="U">IANUS QUADRIFRONS</ref>
(q.v.) ; and Alexander Severus set up colossal statues of all the emperors
who had been deified, with bronze columns on which their res gestae
were inscribed (Hist. Aug. Alex. Sev. 28. 6).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The colossal statue of Mars in the Capitoline Museum was not found here (p. 223, n. i).

<p>A considerable part of the temple of Minerva (which was known as
templum Palladis in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange>, see <bibl>JRS 1919, 30</bibl>, 52) was
standing in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>, and of this we have views (Du Perac,

but this was destroyed in <date value="1606">1606</date> by Paul V and the material used in building
his fountain on the Janiculum. Modern houses stand on the podium
(FUR p. 27; LR 310).</p>
<p>The short ends of the forum were slightly curved, and that toward
the forum Romanum was pierced by two monumental archways, while
at the other end there was one, east of the temple. Of these arches the
last-named was known as arcus Aurae (v. AURA), or arcus Aureus, in the
Middle Ages (cf. the churches of S. Andreas and S. Maria de Arcu Aureo,
of which the former is also called S. Andrea in Portogallo (Arm. 142, 170;
<bibl>Mel. 1905, 149</bibl>; HCh 177, 312), while the arch at the other end, called
arcus Nerviae, is still to be seen in the bird's-eye view of Rome published
in 1577 by Du Perac, and the Colonnacce were called Arca Noe (Noah's
ark); cf. S. Maria de Archa Noe (HCh 311), probably the same as
<pb n="229"/>
S. Maria degli Angeli in Macello martyrum (cf. 342; <bibl>Jord. ii. 474</bibl>, 503).

<p>Within the enclosure wall was a colonnade of marble columns, entirely
surrounding the forum. Two of these columns, with about II metres
of the wall itself, are still standing at the east corner of the forum, in the
Via della Croce Bianca. This ruin, one of the most beautiful in Rome,
is called Le Colonnacce. The wall is peperino, lined with marble, the
columns are 8.80 metres high without the capital, and I.08 in diameter
at the base (<bibl>NS 1912, 226</bibl>), and the intercolumniations 5.30 metres in
width. Above the columns are a cornice and lofty attic which, instead
of following the line of the columns, run along the wall itself in the
intercolumnar spaces, and project and return round the columns, thus
breaking the entablature into sections. The attic, which is 4.40 metres
high, has a plinth and cornice, and in the space between the columns is
a relief of Minerva, 2.65 metres high. The close parallelism between the
architectural details of the forum Transitorium and those of Domitian's
palace has already been noticed (DuP o10, n. I), and is further developed
by Fiechter ap. <bibl>Toeb. i. 54-61</bibl>. It is probable that similar reliefs, either of
Minerva or of some other goddess, stood in each intercolumnar space.
The frieze is decorated with reliefs representing (a) Minerva among the
nine Muses; (b) the punishment of Arachne, together with scenes of
household life, such as spinning, weaving and dyeing-the arts which were
especially under the protection of Minerva. According to Strong (ScR
132) the scenes 'are perhaps to be interpreted as scenes of initiation
into the mysteries of the goddess of wisdom ' (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1877, 5-36</bibl>;

VIII</rs> it is called Forum Romanum vel (et) magnum.  The etymology is
uncertain; the derivation from ferre is generally discarded, but nothing
has been found to take its place.</p>
<p>The valley of the forum, and its continuation, the Velabrum, was at
first a marshy valley, traversed by a stream, which served as one of the
defences of the Palatine city and separated it from the Capitol and
Quirinal; and the first extension of the original settlement towards the
east and south, by which the 'Septimontium ' city was formed, still
left it out. Outside the boundaries of this city, and on the edge of the
valley there lay a burial ground, the so-called <ref target="sepulcretum" n="U">SEPULCRETUM</ref> (q.v.), the
earliest tombs of which are variously dated, though the latest must go
down to the <dateRange from="-699" to="-550">end of the seventh or the middle of the sixth century B.C.</dateRange></p>
<p>Roman tradition long preserved the memory of the original state of
the forum (cf. Ov. <bibl>Fasti vi. 401</bibl> :<foreign xml:lang="la"> hic ubi nunc fora sunt, udae tenuere
paludes; omne redundatis fossa madebat aquis. Curtius ille lacus, siccas
qui sustinat aras, nunc solida est tellus; sed lacus ante fuit</foreign>).</p>
<p>The testimony of geology also shows that the centre of the valley was
originally a swamp. Traces of man's presence were still found at 3.60
metres above sea-level (the lowest point reached in the excavations)
near the foundations of the equestrian statue of Domitian, in the shape
of fragments of carbonised wood; while, at between 6 and 7 metres
above sea-level, the skeletons of three individuals (if not more) were
brought to light. No proper report is as yet available, but Mosso studied
the skull of a female, which he found to be very small and dolichocephalic.
<pb n="231"/>
The height was only 1.22 metre; and near her was found the skeleton
of a newly born infant. All three individuals were unburied; while a
child found close by had been placed on a hollowed piece of wood, with
a small vase near it (<bibl>NS 1906, 46-50</bibl>). The archaic vases found in a
travertine block enclosed in the concrete base of the <ref target="equus-domitiani" n="U">EQUUS DOMITIANI</ref>
(q.v.) belonged no doubt to a tomb, being exactly similar to those of the
sepulcretum.</p>
<p>Hulsen indeed rightly claims that from the point of view of early
Roman history, the confirmation of the traditional ascription of the
cloaca Maxima to the Tarquins, who ruled over Rome in the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth century
B.C.</dateRange> (at the time, that is, when the necropolis ceased to be used) is one of
the most important results of the recent excavations (HC 4).</p>
<p>The forum  thus became a market-place-<foreign xml:lang="la">quo conferrent suas controversias, et quae vendere vellent quo ferrent, forum appellarunt</foreign> (Varro,
<bibl>LL v. 145</bibl>). On each side there was a row of tabernae-the older, the
veteres, on the south side, facing away from the sun; while another row,
the novae, was later on placed on the opposite side. Games were also
held here on the occasion of festivals or funerals, from the earliest times;
justice was administered here, and it naturally became a place of public
resort, first for business, then for politics and popular assembles, and
later on for idleness or amusement. In this it was not dissimilar to the
fora of other Roman cities in Italy and elsewhere. Fest. 84 says that
there are six senses of the word: <foreign xml:lang="la">primo negotiationis locus ... alio, in quo
iudicia fieri, cum populo agi, contiones haberi solent </foreign>(the rest does not
concern us); but the <ref target="comitium" n="U">COMITIUM</ref> (q.v.) was peculiar to Rome, and was
the stronghold of aristocratic government and tradition. This was a
slightly higher area in front of the curia, which adjoined the forum on
the north-east, being separated from it by the <ref target="rostra-vetera" n="U">ROSTRA VETERA</ref> (q.v.)
with the <ref target="sep-romuli-1" n="U">SEPULCRUM  ROMULI</ref> (q.v.), while the <ref target="sep-romuli-1" n="U">VOLCANAL</ref> (q.v.) higher
still, rose on the north-west, on the slopes of the Capitol.
</p>
<p>The open area of the forum was traversed by triumphal processions
on their way up to the clivus Capitolinus; but it is probable that the
Sacra via, which entered at the south-east end, near the Regia, did not at
first have a regularly marked-off course under ordinary circumstances.
Other streets which radiated from this centre were the <ref target="argiletum" n="U">ARGILETUM</ref> (q.v.),
and another street on the further side of the Tabernae Novae,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> In later days there was only a narrow footway between the basilica Aemilia and the
temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the name of which is unknown; it cannot have led
beyond the forum Pacis.
</note> which
led to the Subura and the vicus Longus; the <ref target="vicus-iugarius" n="U">VICUS IUGARIUS</ref> and <ref target="vicus-iugarius" n="U">VICUS
TUSCUS</ref> (q.v.), which led on each side of the Tabernae Veteres through
the Velabrum to the forum Boarium, and so towards the river; the steps
near the temple of Vesta, leading up to the Nova via and on to the clivus
Victoriae; and the street between the curia and the temple of Concord,
which led past the <ref target="lautumiae" n="U">LAUTUMIAE</ref> (q.v.) (from which at first it took its name,
<pb n="232"/>
being called clivus Argentarius under the late empire), which gave access
to the campus Martius and to the roads to the north.</p>
<p>Conflicting influences are visible in the orientation of the buildings
of the forum. The religious orientation of the earliest period, which
followed the points of the compass, was always maintained in the shrine
of Iuturna, the regia and the temple of Vesta, in the comitium and
rostra until the time of Julius Caesar, and in the atrium Vestae (which,
strictly speaking, lies, like the temple, outside the forum) until that of
Nero.  On the other hand, the line of direction of the temples of Saturn
and of Castor (the lacus Iuturnae, at first orientated with the precinct of
Vesta, was afterwards made to conform with this temple), which date
from the <date value="-499">beginning of the fifth century B.C.</date>, already began at that period
to exert an influence the other way, which finally triumphed in the main.
The Tabernae Veteres, and the various basilicas which succeeded them,
doubtless conformed to it; and so did the Tabernae Novae, and consequently the basilica Aemilia. Julius Caesar's transference of the rostra
and reconstruction of the curia dealt (with the exceptions noted above)
the final blow to the old orientation (Mem. L. 5. xvii. 506, 511).</p>
<p>The first indubitable signs of the existence of an open area with well-
defined limits and at a fixed level appear at IO.60-10.90 metres above
sea, and are to be recognised in the following remains of cappellaccio
pavements: (a) in front of the basilica Aemilia (<bibl>CR 1901, 138</bibl>) ; (b) in
front of the temple of Julius Caesar; (c) under the fountain of Iuturna
(but this may have been the floor of a basin; cf. <bibl>NS 1901, 112-113</bibl>;
CR 19o, 141) ; (d) behind the republican Atrium Vestae.</p>
<p>To the next period (circa <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>) we must assign a level some half
metre higher, which can be traced in the comitium, though in the forum
proper there is nothing corresponding to it, except perhaps the remains
of the pavement of the clivus Capitolinus of that date on the north-west
side of the temple of Saturn, at 13.97 metres above sea-level. This is
the period of the erection of permanent structures, called <ref target="basilica" n="U">BASILICAE</ref>
(see <ref target="basilica-aemilia" n="U">B. AEMILIA</ref>, <ref target="basilica-porcia" n="U">PORCIA</ref>, <ref target="basilica-sempronia" n="U">SEMPRONIA</ref>) behind the two rows of tabernae-
large covered halls which provided shelter from sun and rain, in which
courts of law sat, and business was transacted. For the aspect of the
forum at this time, see HC 12. fig. 4, and cf. Plaut. Curc. iv. I. 15. Another
epoch in its history came, when, in <date value="-145">145 B.C.</date>, the Comitia Tributa were
transferred to the forum by the tribune C. Licinius Crassus, who, for the
first time, addressed the people in the forum from the rostra, and turned
his back on the comitium. In <date value="-121">121 B.C.</date> the restorer of the temple of
Concord, Opimius, built a basilica close to it (see <ref target="basilica-opimia" n="U">BASILICA OPIMIA</ref>).</p>
<p>The next level, which is in general 11.80 to 11.90 metres above sea, has
been recently assigned to Sulla<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. Fest. 317:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Statae matris simulacrum in foro colebatur: postquam id collastravit,

stravit'; but cf. Jord. i. I. 525, where it is rightly pointed out that it would have been necessary to specify which Cotta was meant, whereas ' Sulla stravit ' is not more difficult
palaeographically and is far more natural (cf. <bibl>Rosch. iii. 223</bibl>; WR 230; but contrast Pr. <bibl>Myth.

who enumerates (p. 10) a number of pavements which belong to it:
(I) those of Monte Verde tufa, near the shrine of Venus Cloacina and at
the lacus Curtius, and the remains of a similar pavement near the concrete
base in front of the temple of Julius Caesar. There are pieces of similar
pavement outside the area of the forum proper, near the arch of Augustus
and the temple of Vesta (p. 20); (2) those of brick tesserae under the
vicus Tuscus (<bibl>CR 1899, 466</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1899, 253</bibl>) and under the arches at the
west end of the forum (called by Boni 'rostra Vetera ') ; and (3) the selce
pavement of the street under the east front of the arch of Augustus
(which was also found among the foundations of the temple of Julius
Caesar), which is commonly called the vicus Vestae. A row of pozzi <note anchored="true" place="foot"> For the so-called pozzi rituali see <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 58</bibl>; HC 113, 114; <bibl>CR 1904, 330</bibl>; <bibl>1906,
282</bibl>; <bibl>JRS 1922, 13</bibl>; YW  1924-5, 83. They are rectangular pits, lined and covered with
slabs of stone, several lines of which are traceable parallel to the rostra Vetera; while
other lines have been found under the pavement of the Sacra via along the front of the
Basilica Iulia and parallel to the ROSTRA AUGUSTI): so that it would appear that, in the
time of Caesar, the open area of the forum was enclosed by them. Pottery was found in
some of them, and they do not seem at all suited for drainage (they are not connected with
any of the cloacae) ; but their real purpose is quite uncertain.
</note>
parallel to it has been traced on the side towards the forum. (There are
also indications of a corresponding level in the comitium.)  To this level
conform the earlier basilica Aemilia, the shrine of Venus Cloacina, the
lacus Curtius, and the fountain of Iuturna.</p>
<p>The central area of the Sullan forum was enclosed on three sides by
streets paved with polygonal blocks of selce, which took the place of the
early cappellaccio slabs; and some remains of the pavement of the clivus
Capitolinus above that of <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>, at 14.50 metres above sea-level, belong
to this period also.  So also does the viaduct (which Boni calls the rostra
Vetera, but cf. <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref>, p. 451, and <ref target="rostra" n="U">CLIVUS CAPITOLINUS</ref>), the top of which
is at the same level (p. 16). Of buildings assignable to the period of Sulla
we know of little except the curia and the rostra, both of which were
restored  by him; while the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and  the
Tabularium were finished by Catulus.</p>
<p>The next level is 12.60 metres above sea-level. To this belong the
travertine curbs of the shafts leading down to the remarkable series of
cuniculi, as they are generally called <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Their object has never been satisfactorily explained.
</note>-underground passages the main
line of which runs from the south-east end of the forum to the rostra
of Augustus, with branches diverging at right angles (for plan see HC 139,
fig. 69). A few pieces of white marble pavement at this level have been
brought to light ; and to it, too, belongs the restoration of the pavement
of the lacus Curtius in slabs of travertine. This level is undoubtedly
to be assigned to Julius Caesar's remodelling of the forum: Pliny tells
us that when he gave a gladiatorial show, he covered the whole forum
<pb n="234"/>
with awnings, as well as the Sacra via from his own house downwards
and the whole of the clivus Capitolinus (<bibl>NH xix. 23</bibl>).</p>
<p>The travertine pavement of the forum of the Augustan period which
is dated to that period by the inscription of L. Naevius Surdinus <note anchored="true" place="foot"> It is stated in Mem. L. 6. i. 225, n.  ; <bibl>JRS 1926, 133</bibl>, that it is an error to believe that
this inscription indicates the position of the Tribunal Praetorium: but there is nothing
incorrect in this, but only in confining the meaning of the inscription to the tribunal, and
failing to realise that it involved the repavement of the whole forum, or in still believing, as
Richter (<bibl>BRT iv. 29</bibl>) does, that the rest of the pavement is late.
</note> (see
<ref target="tribunal-praetoris" n="U">TRIBUNAL PRAETORIUM</ref>) rises from 12.60 metres above sea-level in front
of the temple of Julius Caesar to 14 metres above sea-level in front of
the rostra of Augustus along the line of the main axis of the central
area (<bibl>JRS 1922, 1-2</bibl>). The discovery of this inscription proved conclusively that this pavement continued to be in use until the end of the
classical period, and that it was not, as had previously been believed,
the work of a later date.  The comitium  had, largely owing to the
erection of the rostra of Caesar and of the <ref target="saepta-iulia" n="U">SAEPTA</ref> (q.v.), lost most of its
political importance; and the forum, transformed by Augustus, who
continued and carried out the designs of Julius Caesar, has come down
to us much as he left it. The majority of the buildings by which it is
surrounded belong to his time-the temples of Saturn, Concord, Castor
and Julius Caesar, and the rostra, the two basilicas, the regia and the
milliarium  aureum.  The curia, though  reconstructed  by Diocletian,
occupies the site of the curia Iulia; and the only other monuments
we have to add are the temples of Vespasian and of Antoninus and
Faustina (the latter really lies outside the limits of the forum proper),
the arch of Septimius Severus, the portico of the Dii Consentes, and the
umbilicus.</p>
<p>The famous reliefs which are believed to have stood on the <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref>
of Augustus (q.v.), whether they belong to the period of Domitian or of
Trajan, represent in all its essentials the forum as it was recreated by
Augustus. (See also Ills. 27, 28.) The equestrian statue of Domitian
(<ref target="equus-domitiani" n="U">EQUUS DOMITIANI</ref>, q.v.) made only an ephemeral appearance in the
central area of the forum; the tribunal of Trajan never existed; and
this area must have long remained clear of monuments of any sort.</p>
<p>In 283, under Carinus, a great fire raged in the forum, which gave an
opportunity for extensive building operations by Diocletian and his
successors.</p>
<p>The seven bases which flank the Sacra via, opposite the basilica Iulia,
are attributed to the period of Diocletian owing to the existence in them
of brick-stamps of Constantine (<bibl>CIL xv. 1569</bibl>, a, 3, 4; 1643, b, 4).  But
inasmuch as the brickfaced concrete of some of them shows clear traces
of having been built round a core of opus quadratum, we must suppose
either that the nucleus was formed of this material, or that this belongs
to similar bases for statues of an earlier period (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 179-184; ZA
85). The columns along the Sacra via are represented in the relief

<pb n="235"/>
referred to on p. 452.	Though the brickwork of the base of the
column of Phocas is similar to that of the other bases, it is perhaps
unlikely that it was erected as early as the time of Diocletian (though
certainly long before <date value="608">608 A.D.</date>), as it would have obstructed the front of
the rostra (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 59-60</bibl>; <bibl>1905, 68</bibl>).  On the other hand, an
equestrian statue of Constantine (<ref target="equus-constantini" n="U">EQUUS CONSTANTINI</ref>) was erected in the
centre of the area, just to the south-east of the spot where that of
Domitian had stood.</p>
<p>But the transfer of the imperial residence to Byzantium led to an
inevitable decline ; and the forum became the scene of struggles between
Paganism and Christianity. Monuments of the beginning of the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth
century</dateRange> may  be found  there  (see <ref target="rostra-augusti" n="U">ROSTRA AUGUSTI</ref>), but in 410
the fires which accompanied the plundering of Rome by Alaric destroyed
many of the buildings of the forum, and notably the basilica Aemilia,
which was never rebuilt. A terrible earthquake is recorded in <date value="442">442</date>
(Paul. Diac. Hist. <bibl>Lang. xiii. 16</bibl>); while in <date value="455">455</date> the Vandals under Gaiseric
pillaged Rome; and the inscription placed on the rostra in commemora-
tion of the naval victory of <date value="470">470</date> is the last monument of the western
empire in the forum. Theodoric (<dateRange from="483" to="526">483-526</dateRange>), on the other hand, must
have repaired many of the buildings of the forum, where a considerable
number of bricks bearing his name have been found (HC 26; all that
are actually published are <bibl>CIL xv. 1665</bibl>a low down in the favissa of the
temple of Vesta, and the same stamp and ib. 1669 in the roof of the old
church of S. Martina) ; and Theodohad's care for certain bronze statues
of elephants (probably from an arch of triumph) in <dateRange from="535" to="536">535-6</dateRange> is testified to
by Cassiodorus (<bibl>Var. x. 30</bibl>). The first church in the forum was SS. Cosmas
and Damianus (<dateRange from="526" to="530">526-530</dateRange>), while the origin of S. Maria Antiqua is probably
even earlier; S. Hadrianus and S. Martina occupied the curia and the
secretarium about 20 years after the dedication of the column of Phocas
(608 A.D.); while the basilica Aemilia and the atrium  Vestae became
the dwellings of Byzantine or papal officials.</p>
<p>It was the earthquake in the time of Pope Leo IV in <date value="847">847</date> (<bibl>LPD ii. 108</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">huius beati tempore praesulis terre motus in urbe Roma per indictionem

which led to the destruction not only of S. Maria Antiqua, but of the
majority of the monuments of the forum; and probably the fire of
Robert Guiscard in <date value="1084">1084</date> caused great damage also. Certainly about
<date value="1130">1130</date> the centre of the forum was entirely impassable (cf. Liber Politicus
Benedicti ap. Fabre, Liber Censuum, ii. 158); and the description
given in the Mirabilia, the genesis of which dates from this period, shows
a curious mixture of real knowledge, false conjecture and pure imagina-
tion. The level of the forum rose gradually (cf. CURIA IULIA; HC fig. 53),
and desolation increased.
The return of Pope Urban V from Avignon (<date value="1367">1367</date>) led to an increased
<pb n="236"/>
interest in ancient monuments, though they were often sacrificed as
building material; and during the Renaissance this latter tendency
became much stronger, despite the general spread of classical culture.
In fact, the very architects who measured and drew the remains of
antiquity were most active in using them as quarries for their own build-
ings. But we also have numerous sketches by artists, which cannot be
enumerated here, but are of the highest value for our knowledge. A
few notable finds of inscriptions and fragments of architecture were made;
but nothing was attempted in the way of scientific excavation until the
<date value="1799">end of the eighteenth century</date>, when a part of the basilica Iulia was
laid bare, but incorrectly identified.</p>
<p>In <date value="1803">1803</date> Fea began by clearing the arch of Severus, and the work
was continued by the French, the temples of Saturn and Vespasian
being isolated, and the column of Phocas cleared; the temples of Castor
and Concord followed. The work was continued in <dateRange from="1827" to="1836">1827-36</dateRange>, and the
isolated excavations connected; but very little more was done until
after <date value="1870">1870</date>, when the work was taken in hand seriously (though at first
with too little regard to the late classical period, see LR 244-245), and
the forum and Sacra via cleared from the Tabularium to the arch of
Titus. Work stopped again in <date value="1885">1885</date>, and was not resumed again until
1898, when extensive excavations were begun by Boni and carried to
the lowest strata at many points over the whole area. In this connection
a passage in LR 240, written in <date value="1897">1897</date>, just before Boni's excavations began,
should be quoted.  ' It is necessary to remind the reader that the excavations of the Forum and of the Palatine have nowhere been carried to the
proper depth. We have satisfied ourselves with laying bare the remains
of the late empire, without taking care to explore the earlier and deeper
strata.' At the same time came the addition of the site of the basilica
Aemilia and of the comitium; and the demolition of the church of
S. Maria Liberatrice rendered it possible to connect up the forum with
the Palatine, and to lay bare the lacus Iuturnae, the whole group of
S. Maria Antiqua, the horrea Agrippiana, etc.</p>

<p> the pork market of Rome during the empire, mentioned

was near the barracks of the cohortes urbanae in the northern part of

forum was therefore probably near S. Bibiana, while the caput Tauri
extended some distance around it, and was perhaps separated from the
horti Tauriani (<bibl>CIL vi. 29771</bibl>) by the via Tiburtina vetus. It is not to

<p>* (sometimes Ulpium: Hist. Aug. Marc. 22. 7; Sid. Apoll.
Carm. 2.544; <bibl>CIL vi. 1724</bibl>, 1749): the last, largest and most magnificent
of the imperial fora, built by Trajan with the assistance of the Greek
architect Apollodorus, and dedicated, at least in part, about <date value="113">113 A.D.</date> (Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxviii. 16</bibl>. 3; <bibl>lxix. 4</bibl>. I; Vict. Caes. 13. 5:<foreign xml:lang="la"> adhuc Romae a Domitiano
coepta forum atque alia multa plusquam magnifice coluit ornavitque</foreign>,
which may perhaps mean that the work was planned and possibly begun
by Domitian; see S. Sculpt. 149; ScR 135; <bibl>NS 1907, 415</bibl>; <bibl>CQ 1908,
144</bibl>). When completed by Trajan it consisted of the forum proper, the
basilica Ulpia, the column of Trajan, and the bibliotheca, and extended
from the forum Augustum north-west between the Capitoline and Ouirinal
hills, with the same orientation as the other imperial fora. Unlike these
it did not contain a central temple of which it formed a virtual porticus
(for the possible significance of the sacellum Libertatis, see below).
<pb n="238"/>
After Trajan's death, however, Hadrian erected the great temple of Trajan
on the north-west side of the bibliotheca (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19. 9; <bibl>CIL
vi. 966</bibl>, 31215), which thenceforth formed an integral part of the forum
whole, and made it conform somewhat to the imperial type. Although the
walls of the forum of Trajan and the forum of Augustus seem to have been
separated by a short distance, they must have been connected by a wide
avenue at least, and thus Caesar's plan of connecting the forum Romanum
and the campus Martius (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 16</bibl>. 8) was finally carried out.</p>
<p>The construction of Trajan's forum necessitated much excavation
and levelling. The space thus prepared was 185 metres in width, and
the extreme length of forum and temple precinct was about 310 metres.
The inscription on the pedestal of the column (<bibl>CIL vi. 960</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> senatus
populusque Romanus imp. Caesari divi Nervae f. Nervae Traiano...
ad declarandum quantae altitudinis mons et locus tan&lt;tis oper&gt;ibus sit

(100 Roman feet) was that of a ridge between the Capitoline and Quirinal
hills which had to be cut away, but geological evidence showed that it
never existed. This was confirmed by the discovery of an ancient street
and houses of the early empire beneath the foundation of the column (<bibl>NS
1907, 389-410</bibl>, 414-427; <bibl>CQ 1908, 141-144</bibl>). In view of this fact various
attempts have been made to explain the inscription, and especially
mons, in some other way (Boni, NA 1906, I Nov.; Proceedings of the
British <bibl>Academy iii. 1907</bibl>,93-98; Binder, Die Plebs, <bibl>Leipzig 1909, 42-5</bibl> ;

Giornale d'ltalia, Rome 1906, Nos. 308, 310, 318; La Nazione, 7 Nov.
1907.  Cf. the summary by Nazari (loc. cit. 595)  ' Veramente questo
studio dovrebbe piuttosto intitolarsi le peripezie di un monte che si
credette esistito fino a questi ultima tempi, fu negato dal Boni il quale
gli sostituisce il vicino Quirinale, fu idealmente recostituito dal Comparetti
con marmi fatti venire dall' Egitto dalla Libia e da altri lontani e vicini
paesi, divenne per opera del Ramorino una montagna di capolavori
artistici, fu inalzato dal Sogliano scaricando immondizie e detriti portati
poi via da Traiano, e finalmente fu ridotto ad un bastione dal Mau ').
The least unsatisfactory explanation as yet suggested is that mons refers
to the extreme eastern shoulder of the Quirinal, the collis Latiaris, that
was cut back so far that the height of the excavation was approximately
100 feet (Hulsen, Geogr. Jahrbuch xxxiv. <bibl>(1911)</bibl>, 203-205). Groh
<pb n="239"/>
(<bibl>RL 1925, 40-57</bibl>) accepts this view, explaining that the mons was probably
situated to the north-west of the forum of Augustus; and suggests that
the column was not placed there, but further west, in order that Trajan's
tomb might not fall within the Pomerium.</p>
<p>The forum proper was a rectangular court (<bibl>Gell. xiii. 25</bibl>. 2: in area
fori) 116 metres wide and 95 long (according to LF 22, who places the
south-east wall of the forum 25 metres farther from the forum Augustum
than other topographers), enclosed by a wall of peperino faced with
marble, except on the sides, where great hemicycles, 45 metres in depth,
projected outwards. Around three sides was a colonnade of different
kinds of marble, single on the south-east, and double on the north-east
and south-west. The entrance to the area was in the middle of the
south-east side, opposite the forum of Augustus, where in 116, the year
of Trajan's death, the senate erected a magnificent arch to commemorate
his victories in Dacia (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxviii. 29</bibl>). This arch is represented
on coins (Cohen, Traj. 167, 169) as single, but with three columns on
each side of the passage way and niches between the columns. It was
surmounted by a six-horse chariot, in which stood the emperor crowned
by Victory <bibl>(Baumeister, Denkmaler, fig. 1974)</bibl>.  On the roof of the
colonnade were gilded statues of horses and military standards, provided
from the spoils of war (<bibl>Gell. xiii. 25</bibl>), and in the centre of the area was
a bronze equestrian statue of Trajan himself (Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 15:
in atrio medio; Cohen, Traj. 1, 2).  On each side was a smaller arch;
and the three entrances corresponded to those of the basilica Ulpia.
One of the colonnades in this forum was called porticus Purpuretica,
probably because the columns were of porphyry (Hist. Aug. Prob. 2;
(but cf. <bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl>. A, 9; <bibl>1918, 13</bibl>. A, 46, where this statement is called
a pure invention); <bibl>CIL xv. 7191</bibl>; <bibl>BCr 1874, 50</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the intercolumnar spaces of the porticoes, and perhaps here and
there in the area, Trajan and his successors set up statues of many distinguished statesmen and generals (Hist. Aug. Marci 22. 7; Alex. Sev.
26. 4: <foreign xml:lang="la">statuas summorum virorum  in foro Traiani conlocavit undique
translatas</foreign>; Sid. Apoll. Carm. 9. 301 and CILvi. 1724, Merobaudes; Sid.

p. 195 (Sch.) and Aug. <bibl>Conf. viii. 2</bibl>. (3), Victorinus; Hist. Aug. Tac. 9. 2,
the Emperor Aurelian). A large number of the inscriptions on these
statues have been found within the precincts of the forum, some of which
state that they were placed 'in foro Traiani ' (M. Claudius Fronto, <bibl>CIL vi.
31640</bibl>, M. Bassaeus Rufus 1599, Claudian the poet 1710, Flavius
Eugenius 1721, Fl. Peregrinus  Saturninus  1727), in  foro  Ulpio
<bibl>(Merobaudes 1724, Petronius Maximus 1749)</bibl>, while the rest omit any
such statement (<bibl>CIL vi. 959</bibl>, 967, 996, 1497, 1540,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This inscription, set up in honour of Vitrasius Pollio, mentions one statue set up in

1683, 1725, 1729, 1736, 1764, 1783, 1789, 3559=32989, and probably
also 997).</p>
<p>In this forum the consuls, and presumably other officials, held court
(<bibl>Gell. xiii. 25</bibl>. 2), and slaves were freed (Sid. Apoll. Carm. 2. 544-545);
here Hadrian burned the notes of debtors to the state (Hist. Aug. Hadr.
7. 6), Marcus Aurelius sold the treasures of the imperial palace to defray
the expenses of war (Hist. Aug. Marc. 17. 4; 21. 9; <bibl>Eutrop. viii. 13</bibl>;
ep. de Caes. 16. 9), and Aurelian burned the lists of the proscribed (Hist.
Aug. Aurel. 39. 3; cf. Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxi. 32</bibl>. 2); and here the laws were
frequently fastened up on bronze tablets (cf. cod. <bibl>Theodos. xiv. 2</bibl>. 1:
proposita in foro Traiani; Leges Novellae Valentiniani III, ed. Meyer-
Mommsen 19.4; 21. . 7; 2. 6; 23. 9; 27. 8; 31 7. et passim).  Down
to <date value="353">353 A.D.</date> the senators kept their money and silver in chests in this
forum and the place of deposit was called Opes (Schol. Iuv. 10. 24).
The forum is represented on coins (Cohen, Traj. 167-169), and is mentioned
in Reg. (Reg. VIII, app.; Pol. Silv. 545).</p>
<p>The hemicycle on the north-east side of the forum area has been
partially excavated (<bibl>NS 1907, 414-427</bibl>). Built of ornamental brick with
travertine trimmings, it consists principally of two stories of chambers
abutting directly against the side of the Quirinal hill (II. 30). The
rooms on the ground floor, which were probably shops, open on the
marble pavement<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This was afterwards covered by a mediaeval road (<bibl>Gnomon iii. 6</bibl>o).
</note>  of the forum.  Above the first story is a gallery
with Tuscan pilasters, into which the rooms of the second story open.
Above this gallery there was another story, the front of which was not
flush with the lower facade but pushed back on the slope of the hill.
The semi-circular space in front of this hemicycle was paved with white
marble and surrounded with a colonnade decorated with gilt bronze
trophies.</p>
<p>Still higher, on the upper level of the Quirinal, is a series of halls, now
occupied by the barracks of the Milizia, approached by steps from
the forum level (Ann. Assoc. Art. cult. Arch. 1910-11 <bibl>(Rome 1912)</bibl>, 43).
The mediaeval name Magnanapoli is by some thought to be a corruption
of Balnea Pauli, but this is itself merely a <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> invention,
based on a false reading in <bibl>Juvenal vii. 233</bibl>. (See <ref target="balineum-phoebi" n="U">BALINEUM PHOEBI</ref>.)
Cf. Adinolfi, Roma nell' eta di mezzo, ii. 43, 47.</p>
<p>Hulsen quotes a privilege of 938 (Reg. Subl. p. 63, n. 24) which speaks
of Adrianus <foreign xml:lang="la">quondam de banneo Neapolim</foreign><note anchored="true" place="foot"> This, as Hulsen has suggested, may be a mistake for Neapolini, the name of the owner

</note>; and the name occurs in the
form  mons Balnei Neapolis and mons Manianapoli in the <dateRange from="1200" to="1299">thirteenth
century</dateRange>  (HCh 351).  Here must have been situated the church of
S. Salvator de Divitiis or in Cryptis (HCh 438).</p>
<p>Two drawings by Cronaca (?) show a portion of the south enclosure
wall of the forum  proper, which was of blocks of white marble, and

<pb n="241"/>
decorated with an internal colonnade like the forum  Transitorium,
with a line of tabernae outside. The frieze with a griffin and cupids,
now in the Lateran (SScR 150, pl. 33), belonged to this wall (Bartoli, in
Mem. AP <bibl>I. ii. 177-192</bibl>), and from its style has been attributed to the
period of Domitian. It has also been thought that the brickfacing of
the north-east hemicycle is characteristic of his reign (RA 113). If,
however, this were so, we should have to attribute to Domitian the removal of the mass of earth from the slopes of the Quirinal which is communicated by the inscription on the column of Trajan-and this is of
course impossible.</p>
<p>The name porticus curva (Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iv. 30</bibl>) should probably be
applied to the south-western hemicycle of this forum, and not to the apse
of the Secretarium Senatus; see <ref target="curia-iulia" n="U">CURIA IULIA</ref> (p. 146).</p>
<p>On the north-west side of the area of the forum was the basilica Ulpia
(probably completed in <date value="112">112 A.D.</date>, <bibl>CIL vi. 959</bibl>; FUR frgs. 25-26; Not.
app.; Cohen, Traj. 42-44; Hist. Aug. Com. 2. I : in basilica Traiani;
Geog. min. ed. Riese, p. 120:<foreign xml:lang="la"> sicut et quae dicitur forum Traianum quae
habet basilicam praecipuam et nominatam</foreign>), rectangular in shape with
apses at each end. Its floor was one metre higher than the level of
the area, and was approached by flights of steps of giallo antico. The
main entrance was in the middle of the east side, from the area of the
forum, where there was a decorative fagade, represented with variations
on three coins (Cohen, Traj. 42-44). This consisted of a row of ten columns,
probably of yellow marble, in the line of the wall, with six others in
front on three projecting platforms. These columns supported an
entablature and attics on which stood quadrigae and statues of triumphatores. The central quadriga was escorted by Victories. The great hall
of the basilica was surrounded with a double row of columns, 96 in all,
probably of white or yellow marble, with Corinthian capitals, which
formed two aisles 5 metres wide, and supported a gallery on both sides
of the nave and at the ends. The nave itself was 25 metres wide, and the
total length of the rectangle, without the apses, about 130. The walls of
the basilica were faced with marble, and its roof was of timber covered
with bronze which is mentioned by Pausanias (v. 12. 6; <bibl>x. 5</bibl>. II) as one
of the most notable features of the whole structure.</p>
<p>The central part of the basilica has been excavated, but the fragmentary granite columns now standing do not belong here, although
they have been placed on the original bases. Some of the original
pavement of white marble is still in situ (Lesueur, La Basilica Ulpienne,
restauration executee en 1823, Paris 1878; cf. D'Esp. <bibl>Fr. i. 78</bibl>). The
architectural fragments now visible in the forum have not been properly
assigned to its various parts (<bibl>Toeb. i. 62-66</bibl>). For the reliefs attributable
to the frieze which decorated the wall surrounding the forum, some
of which were used for the decoration of the arch of Constantine, while

Quirites</foreign>) seems to refer to this shrine, and to indicate that the ceremony
of manumitting slaves, previously performed in the <ref target="atrium-libertatis" n="U">ATRIUM LIBERTATIS</ref>
(q.v.), took place here. This was probably a sacellum, not merely a statue,
and its presence may indicate that this goddess was recognised as the presiding divinity of this forum, a choice significant of the liberal character
of the emperor.</p>
<p>On the north-east side of the basilica Ulpia was a small rectangular
court, 24 metres wide and 16 deep, formed by the basilica itself, the two
halls of the bibliotheca (see below), and, later, the temple of Trajan.
In the centre of this court the columna Traiani was erected in <date value="113">113 A.D.</date>
Nibby (Roma <bibl>Antica ii. 183</bibl>) had already pointed out that the colonnade
joining the two libraries on the north was only removed when the column
was built (<bibl>Toeb. i. 62</bibl>).</p>
<p>Its construction is ascribed in the dedicatory inscription on the
pedestal to the senate and people (<bibl>CIL vi. 960</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> senatus populusque
Romanus imp. Caesari divi Nervae f. Nervae Traiano ad declarandum
quantum  altitudinis mons et locus tan&lt;tis oper&gt;ibus sit egestus</foreign>), but
elsewhere to Trajan himself (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxviii. 16</bibl>), who is said to have
built it to show the depth of excavation of his forum, and for his
sepulchre.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Lehmann-Hartleben (Traianssaule, 3-7) maintains (a) that a further examination of
the chamber in the base shows that a marble table was fixed there to carry the urn, (b) that
there is no room for the letters SOPER but only for sop, so that tan(tis opi&gt;bus should be
read. ' Rupibus ' is proposed in Rev. Ot. anc. 1922, 303-305, but seems to him as unsatisfactory as other previous suggestions.</note> It is also figured on several coins of Trajan after 113 (Cohen,
Traian 115, 284, 359, 555-6).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> As Lehmann-Hartleben points out, the earlier coins (Cohen, ib. 357, which is earlier
than iio; in ib. 358 the type survived till <date value="115">115</date>) show a bird, probably an eagle, on the top
of the column, which, when first projected, was not intended to serve as Trajan's tomb,
though the change of object had come before its erection had actually begun.
</note> It was called columna cochlis (Not. Reg.
VIIi), and was a columna centenaria, like the <ref target="columna-m-aurelii-antonini" n="U">COLUMN OF M. AURELIUS</ref>
(q.v.), although the latter adjective is not actually applied to it in the
few extant references in ancient literature.</p>
<p>It is built of Parian marble.  The shaft and basis, composed of
18 blocks, 3.70 metres in diameter, with the additional block that forms
the capital, and the plinth which is cut in the upper block of the pedestal,
measure 100 Roman feet (29.77 metres) in height.  The height of shaft
and pedestal together is 38 metres, which corresponds with the figures
<pb n="243"/>
of the Notitia (<foreign xml:lang="la">columnam  cochlidem  altam pedes cxxviii semis</foreign> (Cur.:
cxxviis) ). On its top was a statue of Trajan in gilt bronze, of which
we have no representation.  Sixtus V  erected the present statue of
S. Peter in 1588.</p>
<p>Within the hollow  column a spiral staircase with 185 steps leads
to the top (so also Not.:<foreign xml:lang="la"> gradus intus habet clxxxv</foreign>-Cur.: CLXXX).
Light is furnished by 43 narrow slits in the wall (Not.: fenestras XLV).
The pedestal, 5.4 metres high and 5.5 square, is ornamented on three sides
with trophies. The south-east side has a door, and above it the inscrip-
tion. Within the pedestal are a vestibule, a hallway, and a rectangular
sepulchral chamber lighted by a window on the south-west side, in which
the ashes of Trajan in a golden urn were probably placed (Eutrop. 8. 5;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lxix. 2</bibl>; Aur. Vict. ep. 13; Hier. ad a. Abr. 2132; Cassiod.
Chron. 141).  This chamber was evidently robbed, for when re-excavated
in 1906 (<bibl>NS 1907, 361-401</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1906, 379</bibl>; Builder xc. 1906, 368), it
was found that a hole had been cut through the travertine foundation.
To secure the stability of the structure the chamber itself had afterward
been filled up with concrete, certainly after 1764, in which year one Radet
wrote his name on the lintel of the door (CR cit.).</p>
<p>The entire surface of the shaft is covered with reliefs, arranged on a
spiral band, which varies in width from about go centimetres at the
bottom  to nearly 1.25 metre at the top. These reliefs represent the
principal events in the campaigns of Trajan in Dacia between <date value="101">101</date> and
<date value="106">106 A.D.</date>, and also form a complete encyclopedia of the organisation and
equipment of the Roman army in the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>. The average
height of the figures is 60 centimetres, and they were cut after the column
had been erected, so that the joints of the blocks are almost entirely
concealed. These reliefs were also coloured most brilliantly (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst.
1833, 92</bibl>; <bibl>1836, 39-41</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> So PI. 289: but both statements are open to question.
</note>  Casts of these reliefs may be seen in the Lateran
Museum, St. Germain near Paris, and the Victoria and Albert Museum,
South Kensington, London (for these reliefs, see Frdhner, La Colonne
Trajane, Paris 1874; Percier, Restauration des monuments antiques

Saule, Berlin 1926: for the development of the theory that the form
of the monument was suggested by the papyrus roll and that the reliefs
were designed to be monumental illustrations of the history of his campaigns that Trajan himself (cf. Priscian. apud. <bibl>Keil. ii. 205</bibl>. 6) wrote, see
Birt, Die Buchrolle in der antiken Kunst, <bibl>Leipzig 1907, 269-315</bibl>; <bibl>RhM
1908, 39-57</bibl>). In this connection it is worth noting that the earliest
exemplification of the idea of a column decorated with a spiral band
may be seen in a fresco on the back wall of the central room (the so-called
<pb n="244"/>
tablinum) of the house of Augustus (Livia) on the Palatine (Mon. <bibl>Inst.
xi. 22</bibl>).</p>
<p>The little church of S. Nicolas de Columna at the base of the column
is mentioned as early as 1029-32 (HCh 394-396). It disappeared between
1560 and 1570. For some heads of animals which may have come from
the forum, see <bibl>LS ii. 127</bibl>; PT 178; and for the relief of an eagle in the
church of SS. Apostoli, which is traditionally attributed to this forum,
see MD 3539; SScR 206.</p>
<p>On either side of the column and abutting against the north-east
wall of the basilica were the two buildings of the library, the bibliotheca
Ulpia (Hist. Aug. Aur. 8, 24); also called bibliotheca templi Traiani
(<bibl>Gell. xi. 17</bibl>; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 9446</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">atria Traiani</foreign>;<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See also ib. 33808; AL 1343.

<foreign xml:lang="greek">kateskeu=ase de\ </foreign> (Trajan)<foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ bibli/wn a)poqh/kas</foreign>). One building was for
Greek and the other for Latin books. In both were reading rooms, and
on the walls were placed busts of celebrated authors (Sid. <bibl>Apoll. ix. 16</bibl>. 27).
State archives, such as the edicts of the praetors and the libri lintei, or
acts of the emperors, were kept here (Hist. Aug. Aur. I ; Tac. 8; Numer.
II). At a later period, and for some unknown reason, the books were
transferred to the baths of Diocletian (Hist. Aug. Prob. 2; see Boyd,
17-19, 37-39).  v. Domaszewski (<bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl> A, 9; <bibl>1918, 13</bibl> A, 49-52)
considers all the statements of the author of the Hist. Aug. to be pure
inventions, arguing that the only correct name for the library is bibliotheca Traiani, and that the bibliotheca Ulpia was a library in Nemausus
(Nimes) of which the author was curator. See <ref target="schola-fori-traiani" n="U">SCHOLA FORI TRAIANI</ref>.</p>
<p>The forum of Trajan was completed by Hadrian, who erected the great
temple of Trajan and his wife Plotina, templum divi Traiani (Not. Reg.
VIII; <bibl>Gell. xi. 17</bibl>. I; Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19. 9: <foreign xml:lang="la">numquam  ipse nisi in
Traiani patris templo nomen suum scripsit</foreign>-an inaccurate statement,
cf. <bibl>AJA 1905, 441-449</bibl>, or rather a pure invention (v. Domaszewski, cit.
1918, 13 A, 46). Fragments of the double dedicatory inscription (<bibl>CIL vi.
966</bibl>=31215) have been found. The temple was octostyle peripteral,
and stood on a raised platform, round which was a porticus. Fragments of
its granite columns 2 metres in diameter, of smaller columns 1.80 metre
in diameter, and some corresponding capitals of the Corinthian order,
have been found at various times (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst. 1869, 237</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1886,
158</bibl> ff.; for possible remains of pavement of the colonnade, see <bibl>NS 1904,
153-157</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1904, 341-346</bibl>; and for a base which may have belonged
to it, <bibl>JRS 1919, 192</bibl>). The reliefs (supra, 241) found within the area of
the forum may have belonged to the temple, but more probably to the
encircling colonnade.</p>
<p>The forum of Trajan was probably the most impressive and magnificent
group of buildings in Rome (Cassiod. <bibl>Var. vii. 6</bibl>; Vict. Caes. 13. 5;
Paus. locc. citt.), and a vivid picture is given of the astonishment of the
Emperor Constantius on the occasion of his visit to it in <date value="356">356 A.D.</date>
<pb n="245"/>
(Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 15). The history of its destruction begins with
the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange>, and throughout the Middle Ages it furnished an
almost inexhaustible supply of decorative material for the churches and
palaces of Rome (cf. <bibl>BC 1901, 300-308</bibl>; DAP 2. xv. 367-368; LS passim).</p>

<p> a temple erected by Domitian on the site of his father's, Vespasian's,
house, in which he himself was born (Suet. Dom. I, 5; Chron. 146). This
was on the Quirinal just south of the Alta Semita, the present Via Venti

(Suet. loc. cit. ; <bibl>Mart. ix. 20</bibl>. I; <bibl>BC 1889, 383</bibl>; <bibl>RhM  1894, 399-400</bibl>;

mausoleum of the Flavian dynasty. Domitian's ashes were placed there
(Suet. Dom. 17), and it is probable that he had, before his death, removed
thither the ashes of his father and brother (<bibl>Mart. ix. 34</bibl>. 7; Stat. Silv.

in worthless slaves near the temple of Castor, and the fact that the

the basilica Iulia, make it probable that the Graecostadium was an open
court, surrounded by buildings that were used for shops or dwellings,

<placeName>GRAECOSTASIS</placeName>
</head>
<p> a raised place at the edge of the comitium, which served
as a sort of tribunal for ambassadors from foreign states, especially
Greeks (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 155</bibl>). It was near the curia (Cic. ad Q. Fr. ii. I. 3),
on the west of the rostra, and the relative position of these structures
is determined by the statement of Pliny (<bibl>NH vii. 212</bibl>) that the accensus
of the consuls proclaimed the hour of noon when, from the curia, he saw
the sun between the rostra and Graecostasis-that is, in the south.
On the other hand, we are told that in <date value="-304">304 B.C.</date> Cn. Flavius erected a
small bronze shrine (aedicula) to <ref target="concordia-aedicula" n="U">CONCORDIA</ref> (q.v.) on the Graecostasis quae

<pb n="249"/>
spoken of as 'in area Volcani ' (<bibl>Liv. ix. 46</bibl>)-a statement that may mean
that the Graecostasis had been moved or had ceased to exist at all in
Pliny's day. About <date value="-30">30 B.C.</date> sacrifices were offered to Luna 'in Graecostasi' (Fast. Pinc., CIL i². p. 219), and for the years <date value="-137">137</date>, <date value="-130">130</date>, <date value="-124">124 B.C.</date>, it is
recorded that it rained blood or milk on the Graecostasis (Obseq. de prod.
24, 28, 31). The Graecostasis was therefore an open platform between
the comitium and the forum, on the site afterwards occupied by the
arch of Severus, and eastwards. Cf. JRS 1922, II, 25, where Van Deman
places it under and north of the rostra of Augustus. Hiilsen (HC. pl. v.)
places it conjecturally to the west of the Lapis Niger (TF 64), but the
pavement here is probably the pavement of the Sullan rostra vetera
(JRS cit. 22). Nothing is known of its history after the Augustan age,
nor is its exact purpose certain. Other explanations have been given,
but it was probably the place where foreign ambassadors awaited their
summons into the senate (cf. <bibl>Iustin. xliii. 5</bibl>. 0 ; Mommsen, <bibl>Hist. i. 534</bibl>;
Bull. Univ. Wisc. No. 99 <bibl>(1904)</bibl>, 166-170; <bibl>BC 1900, 128-130</bibl>; Thed. 137).

Later in 62 the gymnasium was burned and a bronze statue of Nero
melted (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 22</bibl>). Philostratus (vit. <bibl>Apoll. iv. 42</bibl>) says that
it was one of the most wonderful buildings in the city.</p>
<p>There are no other references to this gymnasium, but it would be
natural to suppose that it was near or connected with the <ref target="thermae-neronianae" n="U">THERMAE</ref> (q.v.),
which Nero is said to have dedicated at the same time (Suet. loc. cit.).
The language of Philostratus seems to make no distinction between <foreign xml:lang="greek">gumna/sion</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">balanei=on</foreign>, so that no inference can be drawn from  it as
to the existence or non-existence of the gymnasium in his time. Hulsen
therefore assumes (HJ 590) that the gymnasium was an integral part of
the baths, and that gymnasium  and thermae were names of the same
structure. In view of what is said of the burning of the gymnasium
(Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 22</bibl>), it is more probable that they were separate buildings.<note anchored="true" place="foot">It is more correct to say that what Vitruvius (v. io) describes are baths pure and

  <p>(Not.): </p>
  <p>a temple of the
   deified Hadrian in the campus Martius, dedicated by Antoninus Pius in
   <date value="145">145 A.D.</date> (Hist. Aug. Pius 8; Verus 3; cf. also <bibl>BC 1885, 92-93</bibl> and HJ 608,
   n. 19). From its position in the list of Reg. (Reg. IX), it was probably
   between the column of Marcus Aurelius and the thermae Alexandrinae,
   and is to be identified with the ancient structure in the Piazza di Pietra
   which is now the Bourse and was formerly called erroneously the basilica
   or temple of Neptune (HJ 608-610; Lucas, Zur Geschichte d. Neptunsbasilica in Rom, Berlin 1904. See <ref target="basilica-neptuni" n="U">BASILICA NEPTUNI</ref>.</p>
  <p>A part of the north-east side is still standing (III. 29) and consists of
   eleven fluted columns of white marble with Corinthian capitals and a
   richly decorated entablature. The columns are 15 metres in height
   and 1.44 in diameter. The order is very like that of the temple of
   Serapis (?) on the Quirinal (see <ref target="sol-templum" n="U">TEMPLUM SOLIS AURELIANI</ref>). The cornice
   has been so badly restored as to appear now in three patterns. The
   wall of the cella behind the columns is of peperino, and the original
   marble lining has entirely disappeared. Cella and columns stand upon
   a lofty stylobate till lately buried beneath the surface of the ground,
   (for remains and excavations, see <bibl>LS iii. 126</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1878, 10-27</bibl>; <bibl>1883,
    14-16</bibl>; <bibl>1898, 40</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1879, 68</bibl>, 267, 314; <bibl>1880, 228</bibl>; <bibl>1883, 8</bibl> ; <bibl>1898,
     163</bibl>; DuP 121-123; HCh 485; YW  1926-7, 102).</p>
  <p>The stylobate was adorned with reliefs, those beneath the columns
   representing the provinces, and those in the intercolumnar spaces trophies
   of victory. In all, sixteen statues of provinces and six trophies are in
   existence, but they are in five different collections in Rome and Naples
   (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1900, 1-42</bibl>; S. Sculpt. 243-246, 388-392; SScR
   237-241; <bibl>JRS 1914, 5</bibl>; Cons. 3 ff.; PT 62). It is probable that the
   temple was octostyle, peripteral, with fifteen columns on a side. If a
   wide flight of steps occupied the whole front of the stylobate, there
   would be space for thirty-six reliefs beneath the remaining columns
   of the peristyle, the number of provinces in the time of Hadrian.</p>
  <p>This temple was enclosed by a rectangular porticus, of which some
   ruins have been found-namely, portions of a travertine pavement
   4 metres below the present level of the soil, peperino blocks, a Corinthian
   column of yellow marble, and various architectural fragments. It is
   possible that this may be the PORTICUS ARGONAUTARUM (q.v.; <bibl>OJ 1912,

quod deus Euboico carmine munus habet.

<p>The reference to Sulla probably means that Sulla restored an existing
temple. In <date value="-218">218 B.C.</date> a supplicatio was decreed ad aedem Herculis (<bibl>Liv.
xxi. 62</bibl>. 9), and in 189 a statue of the god was placed in aede Herculis
(ib. xxxviii. 35. 4). If, as is probable, this aedes is that restored by Sulla,
the original temple must have been erected before 218, probably about
the time of the erection of the circus Flaminius in 221, of which Hercules
was regarded as the guardian. The day of dedication is recorded in the
calendars (Fast. Venus. pr. Non. Iun., CIL i'. p. 221: <foreign xml:lang="la">Herc(uli) Magn(o)

<foreign xml:lang="la">ludi in Minicia</foreign>-sic). This last is interpreted to mean that in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth
century</dateRange> the cult festival was still celebrated, and that ' in Minicia' implies
that the temple was within (or close to ?) the <ref target="porticus-minucia" n="U">PORTICUS MINUCIA</ref> (q.v.),
that is, at the west end of the circus Maximus. With this location agrees
the statement of Ovid (vid. sup.) that this temple was at the opposite

probably north-east of the circus.</p>

<p> the earliest cult-centre of Hercules in
Rome, in the forum  Boarium, erected, according to tradition, when
Hercules had slain Cacus, and his divinity had been recognised by Evander
(<bibl>Liv. i. 7</bibl>. IO-II;   <bibl>ix. 29</bibl>.9; <bibl>Dionys. i. 40</bibl>. 6; Fest. 237; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii.

tradition-probably the earliest-to Evander (Dionys. loc. cit.; cf. Macrob.

by another to Hercules himself (Liv. loc. cit.; Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 581</bibl>; <bibl>Prop.

</note>), and by a third to the companions whom Hercules left behind in Italy (<bibl>Macrob. iii. 6</bibl>. 17). In the
forum Boarium, its site is also described as <foreign xml:lang="la">post ianuas circi Maximi</foreign>
(Serv. loc. cit.), <foreign xml:lang="la">iuxta circum</foreign> (Schol. <bibl>Iuv. viii. 13</bibl> ; cf. Schol. Veron. <bibl>Aen.

(Tac. <bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>). It stood, therefore, in the eastern part of the forum
Boarium, near the carceres of the circus, and probably very near to the
temple of <ref target="hercules-victor-aedes" n="U">HERCULES VICTOR</ref> (q.v.), that is, at the north-east corner of
the Piazza di Bocca della Verita, north of S. Maria in Cosmedin (<bibl>LS iii.

<p>This altar was burned in the fire of Nero (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 41</bibl>), but was
restored, and was standing in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Fest. Serv. locc. citt.).
To the second, third, and fourth centuries belong several inscriptions,
dedicated by praetors to Hercules Invictus (<bibl>CIL vi. 312-315</bibl>, 317-318;

ruins of the round temple, identified with that of <ref target="hercules-victor-aedes" n="U">HERCULES VICTOR</ref> (q.v.),
were destroyed during the pontificate of Sixtus IV, and it is not certain
whether these inscriptions belonged to the temple or ara, or both. No
traces of the altar itself have ever been found (cf. an unsuccessful attempt

Lateran Museum  mentions an aedes dedicated to Hercules Invictus
Esychianus (cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 280</bibl>, 322; <bibl>BPW 1889, 683</bibl>). Its provenance is
unknown, but Hiilsen conjectures that it belonged to a chapel situated
in the vicinity of the forum Boarium, in which the cult of Hercules was
centred (<bibl>RPA  i. 89-94</bibl>, and esp. 93, n. 10; cf. <bibl>NS 1924, 67</bibl>.  For a
Pompeian painting believed to represent Hercules at the ara Maxima
see Mem. Ace. <bibl>Napoli 1911, 169-180</bibl>). Like the first of the two inscriptions cited, it was dedicated to Hercules by Hierus and Asylus (cf.
<bibl>Mart. ix. 103</bibl>), slaves of Tiberius Claudius Livianus, praefectus praetorio
under Trajan (<bibl>Pros. i. 384</bibl>, 753; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 1604</bibl>; <bibl>xv. 932</bibl>, 2317, 7882).
The name Esychianus is explained by the fact that the second inscription
is a dedication (also to Hercules) by one M. Claudius Hesychus, probably
a freedman of Livianus.</p>

was a musagetes (Eumen. pro rest. Schol. 7. 8 (c. <date value="297">297 A.D.</date>); Cic. pro

probably the first of this kind (Macrob. <bibl>Sat. i. 12</bibl>. 16; for a possible
reference to this, see Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 33</bibl>), and also the statues from Ambracia
of the nine Muses by an unknown artist, and that of Hercules playing
the lyre (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 66</bibl>; Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 812</bibl>; cf. Ars <bibl>Am. iii. 168</bibl>);
and a bronze shrine of the Muses that was attributed to the time of Numa
and had been in the temple of Honos et Virtus until this was built (Serv.
<bibl>Aen. i. 8</bibl>). The statue of Hercules and those of the nine Muses are

the <ref target="porticus-philippi" n="U">PORTICUS PHILIPPI</ref> (q.v.) around it (Suet. Aug. 29). The day of
dedication was 30th June (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 797</bibl>; <bibl>Mart. iv. 49</bibl>. 13).</p>
<p>This temple is mentioned in Not. (Reg. IX, om. Cur.), and its site
is ascertained from a fragment (33) of the Marble Plan. It was <foreign xml:lang="la">in circo
Flaminio</foreign> (Eum. loc. cit.), that is, close to the south-west part of the circus
itself, and north-west of the porticus Octaviae, where some remains have
been found that probably belonged to this temple (Rosa, Relazione 75;

(Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 57</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Herculem qui est apud circum maximum in aede

or a restoration by Pompeius, but in any case this temple could not be
identified with the round temple of Hercules in the forum Boarium (<bibl>Liv.

p. 244, 324-and probably Fast. Allif. ib. 217-<foreign xml:lang="la">Herculi Invicto ad circum

<p>Under the eastern part of S. Maria in Cosmedin are remains of the

appears to have existed, although in a ruined state, until the time of
Hadrian I, when it was entirely destroyed (DAP 2. vi. 236, 237, 271;
HCh 327-328). The position of this temple could properly be described
as ad circum maximum, and its identification with the aedes Herculis
Pompeiani is reasonable, but by no means certain. It is possible that
some of the references to a temple of Hercules in foro Boario may belong
to this temple, but it seems certain that it cannot be identified with the
round temple in the forum Boarium, or with the temple ad portam
Trigeminam. This distinction, however, involves a contradiction of
Macrobius' statement (iii. 6. 10: <foreign xml:lang="la">Romae autem Victoris Herculis aedes

satisfactory reconciliation has yet been suggested (HJ 147-148; <bibl>Gilb.

into which neither flies nor dogs were said to enter (ibid. x. 79 : <foreign xml:lang="la">Romae
in aedem Herculis in foro Boario nec muscae nec canes intrant</foreign>). The
fact that this same story is found in Solinus (i. io), who speaks of a
consaeptum sacellum, and in Plutarch (q. Rom. 90:<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)nto\s tw=n peribo/lwn</foreign>),
makes it somewhat uncertain whether it was told originally of the precinct
of the <ref target="ara-maxima-herculis" n="U">ARA MAXIMA</ref> (q.v.), or of this temple.</p>
<p>The passage in Festus (242: <foreign xml:lang="la">Pudicitiae signum in foro bovario est ubi
familiana aedisset Herculis</foreign>) has occasioned much discussion. If Scaliger's
emendation-<foreign xml:lang="la">ubi Aemiliana aedis est Herculis</foreign>-is accepted, the natural
inference would be that the round temple of Hercules was restored by
L. Aemilius Paullus (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 483, n. 58; WR 275, n. 4; <bibl>RE viii. 556</bibl>,
557, 558, 560; <bibl>Rosch. i. 2903</bibl>, 2904, 2905, 2909). This emendation,
however, is purely conjectural (see <ref target="pudicitia-patricia-sacellum" n="U">PUDICITIA PATRICIA</ref>). If Tacitus
(<bibl>Ann. xv. 41</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">et magna ara fanumque quae praesenti Herculi Areas
Evander sacraverat</foreign>) is referring to this temple, as some believe, it was
injured in the fire under Nero, but it must have been restored very soon,
and Pacuvius' frescoes must have been preserved (Plin. loc. cit.).</p>
<p>During the pontificate of Sixtus IV (1471-1484) the remains of a
round temple near S. Maria in Cosmedin were destroyed, but the building
is referred to by archaeologists of the period (e.g. Pomponius Laetus,
Albertinus). A drawing made a little later (1503-1513) by Baldassare
Peruzzi,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It is from the St. Germain MS. of Ligorio that we learn this: Panvinio (Vat. Lat. cit.)

</note> of the plan and fragments (Vat. Lat. 3439, f. 32; De Rossi,
Ann. d. Inst. 1854, pl. 3 ; Altm. 33-36), shows a structure not unlike the
existing round temple which is the church of S. Maria del Sole. This
temple stood just north of the Piazza di Bocca della Verita, between it
and the Piazza dei Cerchi, north-west of the probable site of the ara
Maxima (DAP 2. vi. 241, 242 sq.). The discovery of the gilded bronze
statue of Hercules, of the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century A.D.</dateRange> (HF 1005 ; Cons. 282),
<pb n="258"/>258&lt;/258&gt;
caused it to be identified with the aedes rotunda of Livy, an identification
assisted by the further discovery in the immediate vicinity of a series of
dedicatory inscriptions to Hercules Invictus (<bibl>CIL vi. 312-319</bibl>). These
inscriptions, however, might belong to the <ref target="ara-maxima-herculis" n="U">ARA MAXIMA</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>The relations, topographical and historical, between the different

the existing temple of Honos to both gods in 208. This was forbidden

and built a new part for Virtus, making a double shrine (Sym. <bibl>Ep. i. 20</bibl>:

nor can its proximity to the temple of <ref target="mars-aedes-1" n="U">MARS EXTRA PORTAM CAPENAM</ref> (q.v.)

spoil taken from the Cimbri and Teutones (CIL i². p. 195, n. xvii ; Fest.

on this temple is praised by Vitruvius (vii. praef. 17), who also uses this
temple to illustrate the proper kind of ambulatio around the cella (iii. 2. 5).
According to Festus (344: <foreign xml:lang="la">summissiorem aliis aedem Honoris et Virtutis

Cogerent</foreign>) it was on the slope of one of the hills, generally assumed to be
the Capitoline. In this temple the senate met to vote on the recall of
Cicero from exile (Cic. pro Sest. 116 ; pro Plane. 78 ; de div. i. 59; Val.

Plan (37, 86) represent the three cohortes of these horrea between the
clivus Victoriae and the vicus Tuscus, where excavations since 1904 have
disclosed the remains of the largest; and the identification is made certain
by the discovery of an altar in situ with an inscription recording the
erection of the statue of the Genius Horreorum Agrippianorum. The
excavated portion consists of a trapezoidal court surrounded with rectangular chambers of opus quadratum  (above which are later upper
stories of brickwork) decorated with engaged columns of the Corinthian
order of Augustan date.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Remains of similar chambers (which should not be identified with the porticus Catuli:
LR 127; HJ 57, 58) are visible on the south-east side of the clivus Victoriae, higher up on
the side of the hill: while at the level of and behind the horrea may be seen scanty traces of
a Republican house (traces of wall decoration with stucco and seashells) and a cistern or
quarry cut in the rock, with a shaft leading down into it from the level of the clivus Victoriae. The trapezoidal court has at a later date been filled with buildings of various
periods. First of all brick pillars were built to support awnings; the chapel containing
the statue was erected in the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century A.D.</dateRange>; the rest are still later.
</note> The back wall on the north-east side, originally
of opus quadratum, was reconstructed in brickwork by Domitian when
he erected the building known as the templum Divi Augusti; and the
triangular space between served to conceal the divergent orientation
which he introduced into the latter, the horrea having been constructed
on the same orientation as the domus Tiberiana. (HC 192 ; <bibl>Mitt. 1905,

and about that time, or before the end of the republic, the horrea were
built and called Sulpicia (Hor. <bibl>Carm. iv. 12</bibl>. 18) or Galbae (Porphyr. ad loc.;
Chron. p. 146;  <bibl>CIL  vi. 9801</bibl>, 33743; <bibl>xiv. 20</bibl>; cf. Galbeses, vi.

(vi. 236, 30855, 33906). They were enlarged or restored by the Emperor
Galba and therefore, in later times, their erection seems to have been
ascribed to him (Chron. 146: <foreign xml:lang="la">(Galba) domum suum deposuit et horrea

not only the earliest of the many in this and other parts of the city, but
apparently always the most important (cf. Not. Reg. XIII; Not. dign.
loc. cit.: curator horreorum Galbae), and were depots not only for grain,
but for goods of all kinds (Porphyr. loc. cit.: <foreign xml:lang="la">Sulpicii Galbae horrea dicit

<p>These horrea came under imperial control at the beginning of the

Their staff of officials was organised in cohortes,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Gatti (<bibl>Mitt. 1886, 71</bibl>) held that 'cohors' meant a courtyard (Italian 'corte'); cf.

district has been laid out with new streets. During this process a large
part of the walls and foundations of the horrea were uncovered. Before
191 the principal part excavated was a rectangle on each side of the
present Via Bodoni, about 200 metres long and 155 wide, enclosed by a
wall and divided symmetrically into sections separated by courts. These
courts, three in number, were surrounded by travertine colonnades,
through which opened the chambers of the warehouses (see LF 40; <bibl>BC 1885, 110-129</bibl>; LR 525-526; HJ 175-176). More recent excavations<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For still later discoveries see <bibl>BC 1925, 279</bibl>, 280; <bibl>1926, 267</bibl>, 268.

north-west beyond the present Via Giovanni Branca and as far as the
river to the south-west (<bibl>BC 1911, 206-208</bibl>, 246-260; <bibl>1912, 152</bibl>; <bibl>1914,

The construction was mostly in opus reticulatum. Lead pipes with an
inscription of Hadrian were found, and a hoard of coins (<dateRange from="149" to="268">149-268 A.D.</dateRange>).
More recently remains of horrea were found just upstream of the new
Ponte Aventino (see <ref target="emporium" n="U">EMPORIUM</ref>). The descriptions of these horrea by
earlier writers, such as Benjamin of Tudela of the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> (<bibl>Jord.
ii. 68</bibl>) and Fabretti (de aquis, 1680, 165; <bibl>RE viii. 2461</bibl>) are of doubtful
value, as they probably did not distinguish accurately between the
horrea and surrounding buildings, like the <ref target="emporium" n="U">EMPORIUM</ref>  (q.v.). The
remains of the ' <foreign xml:lang="la">horrea publica populi Romani</foreign>' were sufficiently conspicuous to give their name to a mediaeval region; and we have

the west, with flights of steps leading down to the plain below (<bibl>JRS 1919,

80 metres long. The mound in the present Villa Medici is built on the
ruins of an octagonal nymphaeum (called Parnassus), and ruins have been

to Valerius Asiaticus and were called horti Asiatici (Cass. <bibl>Dio lx. 27</bibl>. 3).
Messalina coveted them, forced Valerius to commit suicide, and seized
the gardens, and was herself killed in them (Cass. Dio loc. cit.; Tac. Ann.
xi. I, 32, 37). Thereafter they were regarded as among the richest of
the imperial properties (Plut. Luc. 39). They were situated immediately
above the point where the aqua Virgo emerged from its underground
<pb n="269"/>
passage through the hill (Frontin. de aq. i. 22), close to the junction of the
present Vie due Macelli and Capo le Case. Their eastern boundary
was probably the ancient road that crossed the Pincian from the porta
Salutaris, corresponding in general with the via Porta Pinciana; their
western boundary was on the slope of the hill above the Due Macelli;
while their extent towards the north is unknown. From  remarks of
ancient writers it is known that these horti were very beautiful, and one
of its halls was apparently known as Apollo (Plut. Luc. 41). Few traces

unsavoury region into a beautiful promenade (Hor. <bibl>Sat. i. 8</bibl>. 14; Acro,
Porphyrio, and Comm. Cruq. ad loc.). They became imperial property
after the death of Maecenas, and Tiberius lived here after his return to

by his <ref target="transitoria-domus" n="U">DOMUS TRANSITORIA</ref> (q.v.) (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 39</bibl>), and viewed
the burning of Rome from the turris Maecenatiana (Suet. Nero 38). This
turris was probably the <foreign xml:lang="la">molem propinquam nubibus arduis</foreign> of Horace
(<bibl>Carm. iii. 29</bibl>. 10). These gardens were near those of Lamia, but it is
not easy to reconcile the indications of the ancient literature or to determine their exact location. Topographers are not agreed as to whether
they lay on both sides of the agger and both north and south of the
porta Esquilina. Maecenas is said to have been the first to construct
a swimming bath of hot water in Rome (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 7</bibl>), which may have
been in the gardens. Whether the horti Maecenatiani of Fronto (<bibl>Ep. i. 8</bibl>)

<placeName>HORTI SALLUSTIANI</placeName>
</head> 
<p>the gardens of the historian Sallust in <rs key="regio6" type="region">Region VI</rs>.
It is possible that the nucleus of these gardens was the horti that Caesar
had owned ad portam Collinam (Ps. Cic. resp. in Sail. 19). Sallust spent
on them much of the wealth that he had amassed in Numidia, and they
probably remained in the family until the time of Tiberius (supra, p.
216, n. i ; <bibl>CIL vi. 9005</bibl>), when they became imperial property (Tac. <bibl>Ann.
xiii. 47</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 5863</bibl>, 8670-8672; <bibl>xv. 7249-7250</bibl>; <bibl>Dig. xxx. 39</bibl>. 8),
but they seem to have been open to some, if not to the general public
(Ps. Sen. ad Paul. I). They were a favourite resort of Vespasian (Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxv. 10</bibl>. 4) and Aurelian (Hist. Aug. Aurel. 49). Nerva died here
(Chron. 146), and they were still a resort in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Incert.
auct. Panegyr. in Const. 14 (ed. Teubn. 300, 26)). In 410 they were
sacked by the Goths under Alaric (Procop. B. <bibl>Vand. i. 2</bibl>).</p>
<p>In these gardens was a conditorium, or sepulchral vault (Plin. <bibl>NH
vii. 75</bibl>), and aporticus Miliarensis (Hist. Aug. Aurel. 49), built by Aurelian,
in which he exercised himself and his horses. Miliarensis should mean a
thousand paces long, and a porticus of that length must have run about
the gardens in various directions. v. Domaszewski (<bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl>. A, 13)
regards this as a mere invention from the similar portico in the domus
Aurea. There was also a temple to <ref target="venus-hortorum-sallustianorum-aedes" n="U">VENUS HORTORUM SALLUSTIANORUM</ref>
(<bibl>CIL vi. 122</bibl>, 32451, 32468; <bibl>BC 1885, 162</bibl>), of which nothing more is
known. In the Acta martyrum  (cf. <bibl>Jord. ii. 124-5</bibl>, 185, 410 for literature) there are references to thermae, palatium, forum, tribunal and
pyramis Sallustii, names which were probably attached more or less
correctly to some of the buildings in these gardens. Of them the pyramis,
identical with that of Eins. (2. 7; <bibl>Jord. ii. 344</bibl>; DAP. 2. ix. 396; cf.
however, Mon. <bibl>L. i. 460</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1914, 373</bibl>), is the obeliscus that was erected
in the post-Augustan age (Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvii. 4</bibl>. 16). (For history and
description of this obelisk, see <ref target="obeliscus-hortorum-sallustianorum" n="U">OBELISCUS HORTORUM SALLUSTIANORUM</ref>.)</p>
<p>The eastern boundary of these horti was probably the via Salaria
vetus, and the northern the line afterwards followed by the Aurelian
wall from the porta Salaria westward (Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 82</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 35243</bibl>;
<bibl>Jord. ii. 123</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1891, 268</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1888, 9</bibl>; HJ 433). On the south the
boundary must have run along the ridge of the Quirinal, close to the
<ref target="fortunae-tres-aedes" n="U">FORTUNAE TRES</ref> (q.v.; cf. Anth. Pal. app. iv. 40), between the Servian
wall and the vicus portae Collinae (Via Venti Settembre). How far the
gardens stretched to the west is uncertain, but probably not beyond
the Piazza Barberini. This district was called Sallustricum in the Middle
Ages (Andreas Fulvius, Antiquitates, f. 24).</p>

<p> the long ridge on the right bank of the Tiber, running almost
due north from a point opposite the Aventine to what is now called
Monte Mario (<bibl>Mart. iv. 64</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. ix. 14</bibl>. 8), a distance of about 5 kilometres.  This was in the <ref target="ager-vaticanus" n="U">AGER VATICANUS</ref> (q.v.), and was sometimes
called Mons Vaticanus (Hor. <bibl>Carm. i. 20</bibl>. 7). It is separated from the
plateau behind by a long depression, and is itself not entirely continuous,
being partially broken on the south, west and north-west of the Vatican
by natural and artificial valleys (<bibl>BC 1892, 288</bibl>). The term Ianiculum
is now limited to the part of the ridge immediately opposite the city,
from the point where it approaches within 100 metres of the river near
S. Spirito southwards, a distance of 2 kilometres. The highest point of
the ridge in its larger sense is the northern end, Monte Mario, 146 metres
above sea-level, and the highest point within the line of the Aurelian wall
is west of the present church of S. Pietro in Montorio, 69 metres. At the
porta Aurelia (porta S. Pancrazio) it is about 82 metres high, and a short
distance farther west about 81. The average height of the ridge above
the campus Martius is 60-70 metres (cf. Cic. de leg. agr. i. 16; <bibl>ii. 74</bibl>).
This ridge is a marine formation belonging to the Older Pliocene period,
and consisting mainly of a bluish grey marl, much used for making bricks
and pottery, and of yellow sea sand, of great value for building purposes.</p>
<p>The name was usually explained by the ancients as meaning' the city
of Janus' (Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 357</bibl>; Varro ap. August. civ. <bibl>Dei vii. 4</bibl>; <bibl>Solin.
ii. 5</bibl>; <bibl>Macrob. i. 7</bibl>. 19; Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 245</bibl>); sometimes, apparently, as
the 'gate' (Fest. 104).  The connection between the hill and Janus was
doubtless due to the presence here of a cult of the god, who was afterwards
explained as an early king of the district (cf. WR 103 ff.). No trace of
this cult existed in historical times, but it may be inferred from that of
<ref target="fontus-ara" n="U">FONS</ref> or <ref target="fontus-ara" n="U">FONTUS</ref> (q.v.), the reputed son of Janus.  According to Pliny
(<bibl>NH iii. 68</bibl>), the original name of this settlement was Antipolis (v. <ref target="pagus-ianiculensis" n="U">PAGUS
IANICULENSIS</ref>).</p>
<p>Ancus Martius was said to have fortified the Janiculum in order that
it might not be occupied by a hostile force (<bibl>Liv. i. 33</bibl> ; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 45</bibl>),
and during the republic a guard was always posted on the hill while
the comitia centuriata was meeting in the campus Martius (<bibl>Liv. xxxix. 1</bibl> 5;
Cass. <bibl>Dio xxxvii. 28</bibl>); but there is no evidence of any fortification until

Aemilius, in <date value="-142">142 B.C.</date> Whatever was built then was probably at the
top of the ridge, near the porta Aurelia in the line of the later wall of
Aurelian, which was brought up to this point from the river for this very
reason (Richter, 51, 120). It was the first point of attack for Marius
and Cinna in the Civil Wars (Liv. Ep. 80; Appian, <bibl>BC i. 67</bibl>; <bibl>Flor.

<p> an arch or gate, intended for a passage way (Cic. de nat. deor. ii. 67:
<foreign xml:lang="la">Ianum . . . ab eundo. .. ex quo transitiones perviae iani ... nominantur</foreign>),
sometimes surmounted with statues (Suet. Aug. 31: <foreign xml:lang="la">Pompei quoque
statuam ... marmoreo Iano superposuit</foreign>), of which there were many in
Rome (Suet. Dom. 13: <foreign xml:lang="la">ianos arcusque.. . tantos ac tot exstruxit</foreign>; Ov.
<bibl>Fast. i. 257</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">cum tot sis iani cur stas sacratus in uno</foreign>). The word was
also used of one of the passage ways through a double gate (<bibl>Liv. ii. 49</bibl>. 7:<foreign xml:lang="la">infelici via dextro iano portae Carmentalis profecti ad Cremeram flumen
perveniunt</foreign>). Of these iani in Rome one, Ianus Primus, is mentioned
only in one inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 12816</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> L. Aufidius L. l. Eperastus ab
Iano primo</foreign>, cf. Comm. in hon. Momms. 642), and its site is unknown,
although often supposed to have been in the forum.</p>
<p>The second is the well-known Ianus medius which, wherever it occurs
in literature, designates the place in the forum where bankers and
speculators gathered for business (Cic. de off. ii. 87: <foreign xml:lang="la">de collocanda
pecunia . .commodius a quibusdam  optimis viris ad Ianum  medium
sedentibus . . . disputatur</foreign>; Phil. 6. 15:<foreign xml:lang="la"> L. Antonio a lano medio patrono</foreign>;
7. 16:<foreign xml:lang="la"> patronus Iani medii</foreign>; <bibl>CIL vi. 5845</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> a Iano medio</foreign>; 10027; Hor. <bibl>Sat.
ii. 3</bibl>. 18: <foreign xml:lang="la">postquam omnis res mea Ianum ad medium fracta est</foreign>; and
without doubt Ov. Rem. Am. 56 : <foreign xml:lang="la">qui puteal Ianumque timet celeresque
Kalendas torqueat hunc aeris mutua summa sui</foreign>). The scholia on the
passage in Horace (Porphyr.: <foreign xml:lang="la">hoc ideo qui omnes ad Ianum in basilica
consistebant</foreign>; Acron:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Iani statuae tres erant; ad unam illarum solebant
convenire creditores et feneratores, alii ad reddendum, alii ad locandum
fenus. Ianum  ad medium  ideo, quoniam  in Rostris simulacrum Iani
erat, ubi res pecuniariae agebantur per feneratores. Aliter: Ianus
medius locus dictus est prope basilicam Pauli ubi vasa aenea venundabantur</foreign>; similarly Comm. Cruq.) seem  to agree in placing the ianus
medius near the basilica Aemilia, although they confuse statues with
arches. With this position of the Ianus subsequent topographers have
agreed, although they differed as to which end of the basilica should be
understood.</p>
<p>A second passage in Horace (Ep. i. I. 53-54: <foreign xml:lang="la">o cives cives quaerenda
pecunia primum est; virtus post nummos: haec Ianus summus ab imo
<pb n="276"/>
Prodocet</foreign>) has complicated the matter. Summus and imus have been
brought into connection with medius, and in support of the theory of
three iani in the forum at different points, summus, medius and imus,
some scholars cite a passage in Livy (xli. 27: <foreign xml:lang="la">forum porticibus tabernisque
claudendum et Ianos tres faciendos</foreign>) which states that in the year <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date>
the magistrates erected three iani in some colony, presumably in imitation
of conditions in the forum at Rome. No hint of any such connection
of summus and imus with medius is given by the scholiasts (Porphyr.:<foreign xml:lang="la">ad ianos eos qui sunt in regione basilicae Pauli feneratores consistunt...
Unus enim illic ianus in summo alius in imo est quos haec inducit monere</foreign>;
Acron:<foreign xml:lang="la"> duo Iani ante basilicam Pauli steterunt ubi locus erat faeneratorum. Ianus dicebatur locus in quo solebant convenire feneratores</foreign>),
who agree, however, in placing the two iani in front of the basilica Aemilia,
as they did the medius. The Commentator Cruquii gives another explanation of <foreign xml:lang="la">summus ab imo-hoc est omnes Romani a maximo ad minimum
qui ad Ianum conveniunt hoc prodocent, i.e. aperte dicunt</foreign>.</p>
<p>There is still a third passage in Horace (<bibl>Ep. i. 20</bibl>. I : <foreign xml:lang="la">Vortumnum
Ianumque liber spectare videris, scilicet ut prostes Sosiorum pumice
Mundus</foreign>) on which the scholiast (Porphyr.) remarks: <foreign xml:lang="la">Vortumnus ...
in vico Turario sacellum habuit; Ianus quoque similiter vicus est ab Iano
gemino sic appellatus qui in eo arcum habet sibi consecratum</foreign> (cf. Acron
and Comm. Cruq., which, however, do not mention any vicus). This is
the only mention of a vicus Ianus, and is evidently due to confusion and
an error of interpretation on the part of the scholiast, but nevertheless
a theory has been constructed on this basis which identifies this vicus
Ianus with a supposed street in front of the basilica Aemilia, on the
north side of the area of the forum, corresponding with the continuation
of the Sacra via on the south side, and spans this with three arches,
Ianus summus medius and imus, from west to east (Bentley, Hor. Ep. i.
I. 54; Lanciani, <bibl>BC 1899, 99</bibl>; LR 253-254; <bibl>BPW  1913, 981</bibl>; Thdd.
176, who identifies Ianus medius with Ianus Geminus; and many edd.
of Horace). If there were any sufficient evidence for a vicus Ianus, Ianus
summus ab imo might easily be explained as referring to this street, but
it is altogether probable that the phrase is a poetical expression meaning
' from one end of the Forum to the other' (Jord.), and cannot be taken as
authority for a Ianus summus and a Ianus imus.</p>
<p>It is probable that at the beginning of the Augustan period, Ianus
medius was a small single arch, near the basilica Aemilia, but it is not
possible to decide whether medius refers to its position in the forum or
with respect to other arches. There may have been other iani in the
forum, but there are no certain references to them. Those who suppose
that such iani stood where other streets entered the forum, look for
evidence to the two cases of possible iani on the Rostra relief (see <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref>),
the remains of an arch of later date across the vicus Iugarius, the presence
of such a Ianus near the statue of Vortumnus (see above) in the vicus
<pb n="277"/>
Tuscus, where traces of an arch are alleged to have been found (<bibl>BPW
1903, 1117</bibl>), and some indications in the scholia. The inconsistencies
and errors of the scholia may be due to the changes of the later empire.

<p>a temple in the forum Holitorium, built
by C. Duilius after the victory at Mylae (Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 49</bibl>). Its position
is defined as <foreign xml:lang="la">ad theatrum Marcelli</foreign> (Fast. Allif. et Vail. ad xvi Kal. Sept.,

more likely that a scholiast confused this temple with the Janus at the bottom of the
Argiletum, and accordingly wrote '<foreign xml:lang="la">sacrarium hoc, id est belli portas, Numa Pompilius
fecit circa imum Argiletum iuxta theatrum Marcelli</foreign> ' (cf. <bibl>Liv. i. 19</bibl>. 2). This is the second

and <foreign xml:lang="la">extra portam Carmentalem</foreign> (Fest. 285). The day of dedication was
the Portunalia, 17th August (see Fast. Allif. et Vallens.; and for the
significance of the fact, Pais, Fasti Triumphales Capitolini, ii. 474-478).
The restoration of this temple was begun by Augustus and completed
by Tiberius in <date value="17">17 A.D.</date> (Tac. loc. cit.), but the dedication day of the restored
structure was 8th October (Fast. Amit.). According to Pliny (<bibl>NH
xxxvi. 28</bibl>) Augustus dedicated in this temple a statue to Janus which
was brought from Egypt, the work either of Scopas or Praxiteles. It
was probably the<foreign xml:lang="greek">(*ermh=s dike/falos</foreign>of the former (WR 106; Jahr. d. <bibl>Inst.
1890, 148-149</bibl>). The statement is made (Fest. 285) that the senate was
forbidden to meet in this temple because their decree that the Fabii
should go forth to the siege of Veii was made in aede Iani; but this is
probably apocryphal, for there is no evidence of an earlier temple of
Janus in Rome in which a meeting of the senate could have been held.
The structure of Duilius, however, was probably on the site of an earlier
shrine (HJ 508; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 26</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb. i. 260-265</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 380</bibl>; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>.347).</p>
<p>Under the present church of S. Nicola in Carcere are the ruins of three
temples, standing side by side with the same orientation and facing the
forum Holitorium. The architectural fragments are of travertine, tufa
and peperino (all of which were covered with stucco), except some of
marble of the later restorations, and belong to the period of the republic.
The central and largest is Ionic, that on the north is next in size and also
Ionic, while that on the south is smallest and Doric. The second, on the
north, is generally assumed to be the temple of Janus. It is dated by
Frank to about <date value="-90">90 B.C.</date> It is hexastyle, peripteral except at the back, and
six of its columns, 0.70 metre in diameter, are still standing, built into
the wall of the church. The temple in the middle is assigned to Spes,
and the smallest to Iuno Sospita (HJ 507-514; <bibl>Mitt. 1906, 169-192</bibl>;
LR 513-514; Delbrfick, Die drei Tempel am Forum Holitorium, Rome,
1903; for divergent views see ZA 238-248; TF 126-130). It may be
remarked, in regard to the latter's theory, that the order of the last two
<pb n="278"/>
temples should be reversed, and that, while it may require some explanation that the temple of Janus was not also damaged by the fire of 213, it
is even more difficult to suppose that the central temple was fitted in the
space between two smaller temples already in existence. In pursuance
of this theory, Frank assigns the southern temple in its present form
to a restoration of <date value="-31">31 B.C.</date> The central temple he dates about <date value="-90">90 B.C.</date>

<p>It should be noted that the name of the church (in Carcere) was only

<bibl>Dio li. 20</bibl>).</p>
<p>Tradition varied as to the date and origin of this shrine. According
to one form of the story (<bibl>Macrob. i. 9</bibl>. 17-18) it was already in existence
when the victorious Sabines under Titus Tatius were stopped and driven
back by floods of hot water which Janus caused to gush forth from his
<pb n="279"/>
temple and through the gate of the city <foreign xml:lang="la">sub radicibus collis Viminalis</foreign>.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See <ref target="lautolae" n="U">LAUTOLAE</ref>.
</note>
This gate was called the porta Ianualis from this event, and apparently
identified or confused with the temple (cf. Jord. <bibl>Hermes 1869, 252</bibl> ; Top.
i. I. 177; PI. 191). A variant of this legend made the erection of the
shrine a result of the intervention of the god (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 263-276</bibl>; cf.
Serv. <bibl>Aen. i. 291</bibl> ; <bibl>viii. 361</bibl>; Varro, LLv. 156, 165; Ter. Maurus, frg. i. 5).
Another tradition was that Romulus and Tatius built the temple as a
sign of the union of the two communities (Serv. <bibl>Aen. i. 291</bibl> : <foreign xml:lang="la">alii dicunt
Tatium et Romulum facto foedere hoc templum aedificasse unde et Ianus
ipse duas facies habet, quasi ut ostendat duorum  regum  coitionem</foreign>;
<bibl>xii. 168</bibl>), and still another that it was erected by Numa as an index pacis
bellique (<bibl>Liv. i. 19</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 33</bibl>; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 165</bibl>) in order that
when open it might indicate that Rome was at war, and when closed
that she was at peace. This became the accepted signification of the
temple, and after the reign of Numa its doors were closed in 235 after
the first Punic war (Varro, Liv. locc. citt.), in <date value="-30">30 B.C.</date> after the battle of
Actium (Liv. loc. cit.; Hor. <bibl>Carm. iv. 15</bibl>.9), and twice besides by Augustus
(Mon.Anc.ii. 42-46; Suet. Aug. 22; cf. Cohen, Aug. 385 = BM. Aug. 126);<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Mr. H. Mattingly informs me that Cohen,.Aug. 110, is best disregarded, as being

and afterwards at more frequent intervals down to the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange>
(Hist. Aug. Comm. 16; Gord. 26; Claudian. de cons. <bibl>Stil. ii. 287</bibl>; Amm.

<p>There is no mention of any rebuilding of this temple, and therefore
it was probably never moved from its original site, which, according to
the practically unanimous testimony of all forms of the tradition, was
near the point where the <ref target="argiletum" n="U">ARGILETUM</ref> (q.v.) entered the forum close to
the curia (<foreign xml:lang="la">ad infimum  Argiletum</foreign>, <bibl>Liv. i. 19</bibl>; <foreign xml:lang="la">circa imum  Argiletum</foreign>

generally been supposed that it lay between the curia and the west end
of the basilica Aemilia, but the excavations have as yet shown hardly
any room  here for even so small a building (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 47</bibl>). Varro
(<bibl>LL v. 165</bibl>) says that the porta Ianualis was the third gate in the wall
of the Palatine city-<foreign xml:lang="la">dicta ab Iano et ideo positum Iani signum et ius

the Palatine city could have been on the north side of the forum valley.</p>
<p>Procopius' description (<bibl>B.G. i. 25</bibl>) and coins of Nero (Cohen, Nero
114, 115, 132-177; BM. Nero 64, 111-113, 156-167, 198-204, 225-233,
319-322, 374, 375 and pp. clxxiv, 267, 398) agree in representing this
temple as a small rectangular structure of bronze, with two side walls
and double doors at each end. The walls were not so high as the doors,
<pb n="280"/>
and were surmounted by a grating. These gratings and the arches over
the doors supported an entablature of two members extending all around
the building, but there was no roof. The ancient bronze statue of the
two-faced god (bifrons, Verg. <bibl>Aen. xii. 198</bibl>; biformis, Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 89</bibl>)
stood in the centre of the temple, which was no temple in the ordinary
sense but a passage (ianus). No traces of the structure have ever
been found, and there is no reference to it after Procopius. (For this

<p> the island in the Tiber, included in the <rs key="regio14" type="region">fourteenth
region</rs> of Augustus, and now called isola di S. Bartolomeo (111. 32; cf.
also 111. 37). It seems to be the end of the ridge of which the Capitoline
hill is a part, and owing perhaps to the harder character of its tufa, the
river did not cut it away entirely but divided and flowed on either side.
<pb n="282"/>
It was often called simply insula, but was also spoken of by different
names-insula Tiberina (<bibl>Vitr. iii. 2</bibl>. 3; Acro Schol. in Hor. <bibl>Sat. ii. 3</bibl>. 36),
inter duos pontes (Plut. Popl. 8; lustin. Martyr. apol. i. 26; Aeth.
83, Riese;  Chron. 145;  inscr. <bibl>BCr 1905, 231</bibl>; FUR  42), insula
Aesculapii (Suet. Claud. 25; <bibl>Dionys. v. 13</bibl>), insula serpentis Epidaurii
(Sidon. Apoll. <bibl>Ep. i. 7</bibl>. 12); and in the Middle Ages, insula Lycaonia
(HJ 632, note 21; and esp. Besnier, 76-87).  It was also called simply
insula (<bibl>CIL vi. 9824</bibl>, 33864; Fest. 110).</p>
<p>The present length of the island is 269 metres, and its greatest width
67 metres. Tradition held that its nucleus was formed by the grain
from the fields of the Tarquins, which was thrown into the Tiber in
great quantities after the expulsion of the kings (<bibl>Liv. ii. 5</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. v. 13</bibl>;
see GAIA). In <date value="-292">292 B.C.</date> the serpent of Aesculapius, which, with the
statue of that god, was being brought to Rome, left the ship and swam
ashore on the island. A temple was erected to the god and the island
was consecrated as its temenos, although shrines to other divinities
(e.g. <ref target="iuppiter-iurarius" n="U">IUPITER</ref>, <ref target="faunus-aedes" n="U">FAUNUS</ref>, <ref target="tiberinus" n="U">TIBERINUS</ref>, <ref target="semo-sancus" n="U">SEMO SANCUS</ref>, q.v.) were afterwards
built on it.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For a terra-cotta acroterion which probably came from an archaic temple on the
island-it is too early in style to be attributable to that of Aesculapius-see HF 1510;
<bibl>JRS 1914, 189</bibl>; Van Buren, Figurative Terracotta Revetments, 24.
</note> In consequence of this legend of the serpent the island
itself was made to resemble a ship. A stone platform was built round
it, and upon this a wall was erected which in shape reproduced exactly
the sides of a Roman ship (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1867, 389</bibl> ff.; Durm, Baukunst,
fig. 537). A considerable part of the travertine stern can still be seen
at the east end of the island (LR 19). An obelisk, fragments of which
are in the museum at Naples, is thought to have represented the mast.
We are not informed as to the time when this was done, but the remains
of the walls point to the same period as that of the construction of the
pons Fabricius (<date value="-62">62 B.C.</date>) and pons Cestius (<dateRange from="-70" to="-42">70-42 B.C.</dateRange>), and it is possible
that the erection of these two bridges was part of the same plan as the
building of the ship. Before the building of these stone bridges, the
island was doubtless connected with the left bank by a wooden structure
at least as early as the time when the cult of Aesculapius was established
(cf. <bibl>Liv. xxxv. 21</bibl>. 5, where the flood of <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> is said to have destroyed
' duos pontes ').</p>

of the island, see Besnier, L'lle Tiberine dans l'Antiquit6, Paris 1902

<p> the principal temple of Isis in Rome, situated in the campus
Martius, adjoining the temple of Serapis in the same precinct (see below).
It is also referred to as fanum  (Iuv.), templum, templa (Apul., Mart.,
Chron. min., Ovid, Tib.) <foreign xml:lang="greek">I)ero/n</foreign>(Joseph.),<foreign xml:lang="greek"> vao/s</foreign> (Cass. Dio, Lydus),
and with the temple of Serapis as Iseum et Serapeum (Eutrop., Hier.,
Hist. Aug. Alex., Chronog., Not.), and <foreign xml:lang="greek"> to\ seapei=on kai\ to\ )isei=on</foreign> (Cass.
Dio). It stood outside the pomerium in the campus Martius (Apul. <bibl>Met.
xi. 26</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">reginae Isidis quae de templi situ sumpto nomine Campensis
propitiatur</foreign>; Not. Reg. IX), near the Saepta (<bibl>Iuv. vi. 528-529</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">in
aedem Isidis antiquo quae proxima surgit ovili</foreign>; <bibl>Mart. ii. 14</bibl>. 7), and the
evidence of fragments of the Marble Plan and sculpture (see below) makes
it reasonably certain that it was just west of the Saepta, between it and
the temple of Minerva, in the space between the Vie del Seminario,
S. Ignazio, del Gesa, and the Palazzo Altieri.</p>
<p>In <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date> the triumvirs voted to erect a temple to Isis and Serapis
(Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 15</bibl>. 4), but it is not known whether this temple was
actually built or not. Tibullus (i. 3. 27-30: <foreign xml:lang="la">picta docet templis multa
tabella tuis ... ante sacras fores</foreign>) and Ovid (<bibl>A.A. i. 77</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> nec fuge linigerae
Memphitica templa iuvencae</foreign>; <bibl>Am. ii. 13</bibl>. 7) speak of a temple or temples
of Isis as a conspicuous resort of women, especially of prostitutes, a
characteristic also of the later temple (<bibl>Iuv. ix. 22</bibl>; <bibl>Mart. ii. 14</bibl>. 7; <bibl>x.
48</bibl>. I). On the other hand, repressive measures against Egyptian cults
<pb n="284"/>
were carried out by Augustus in <date value="-28">28 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio liii. 2</bibl>. 4), by Agrippa
in 21 (ib. liv. 6. 6), and by Tiberius in <date value="9">9 A.D.</date> (Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 85</bibl>; Suet. Tib.
36), who is even said to have destroyed a temple of Isis and thrown her
statue into the Tiber (Joseph. <bibl>Ant. xviii. 3</bibl>. 4). Between the reign of
Tiberius and <date value="65">65 A.D.</date> (<bibl>Lucan viii. 831</bibl>) the cult of Isis had been officially
received in Rome, and this temple in the campus Martius, if not built
in the previous century, must have been built then, perhaps by Caligula.
It was burned in <date value="80">80 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 24</bibl>. 2), restored by Domitian
(<bibl>Eutrop. vii. 23</bibl>. 5; Chron. 146; Hier. a. Abr. 2110), and by Alexander
Severus<note anchored="true" place="foot"> An inscription which was seen (it was impossible to copy it) on a large architrave
belonging to an entrance to the Serapeum appeared to be a dedication by Septimus Severus
and Caracalla (<bibl>NS 1925, 239</bibl>).
</note> who added to its treasures of art (Hist. Aug. <bibl>Alex. xxvi. 8</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">Isium et Serapium decenter ornavit additis signis et Deliacis et omnibus
mysticis</foreign>; cf. <bibl>Iuv. xii. 27</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">pictores quis nescit ab Iside pasci?</foreign>). In
219-220 the statue of Isis in this temple is said to have turned its face
inwards (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxix. 10</bibl>. I), and there are two other references to it
in later literature (Porphyr. vit. Plotin. 10; Lydus, de mens. iv. 148).
Certain inscriptions of the empire also refer without doubt to this temple
(<bibl>CIL vi. 344-347</bibl>, cf. 30744; IG xiv. i. 961, 1031) and it is represented
on a coin of Vespasian (Cohen, Vesp. 484-485) struck to commemorate
the fact that Vespasian and Titus spent the night before the celebration
of their triumph for the taking of Jerusalem in <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Or better, in the VILLA PUBLICA (q.v.) near it (HJ 494; <bibl>JRS 1921, 26</bibl>). They did
not spend the night in the porticus Octaviae (contrast HJ 542, n. 95), but only met the
Senate there.
</note> this temple (Joseph.
b. <bibl>Iud. vii. 5</bibl>. 4). This coin shows the facade of a narrow peribolos
with four Corinthian columns and a round pediment containing the
figure of Isis on a dog. Inside the peribolos, and entirely detached
from it, is the temple proper (Berl. Sitz.-<bibl>Ber. 1909, 640-648</bibl>; SHA
1910, A. 7, 9 sqq.; cf. also Cohen, Faustina iunior 300; Gnecchi, <bibl>Med.
ii. 68</bibl>. 9; PT 226-227).</p>
<p>It is probable that the temple of Isis was north of that of Serapis, and
that it was long and narrow and stood at one end of a long and narrow
enclosure, resembling in form and architecture the forum Transitorium.
Six of its columns have been found in situ. It is not clear whether the
entrance was on the north, or on the south toward the Serapeum. The
two small obelisks (Marucchi, Ob. eg. 91, 96, 115; <bibl>BC 1896, 260</bibl>, 265,
284), now in the Viale delle Terme and the Piazza della Minerva, and
probably that of the Piazza della Rotonda, were found on the site of
the Iseum  and may have stood in front of it. The obelisk of the
Piazza Navona was probably first set up in the precinct (see <ref target="obelisci-isei-campensis" n="U">OBELISCI
ISEI CAMPENSIS</ref>).</p>
<p>The Serapeum, although it is not mentioned alone, was a separate
building of wholly different style, as is shown by fragments of the Marble
Plan (32, 59). Its south end was formed by a large semi-circular apse,
<pb n="285"/>
about 60 metres in diameter, in the outer wall of which were several
small exedrae. The inner side of this apse was adorned with columns,
and a colonnade formed its diameter. Immediately north of the apse
was a rectangular area, of the same width as the apse, and about 20 metres
deep, with an entrance in the middle of the front and on each side. The
plan closely resembled that of the' Canopus ' at Hadrian's Villa (Lanciani,
<bibl>BC 1883, 33-131</bibl>; <bibl>1887, 377</bibl>; Hilsen, <bibl>Mitt. 1903, 17-57</bibl>, p. i., ii. ; for
the Arco di Camigliano, probably the eastern entrance to the precinct,
cf. also <bibl>NS 1882, 349</bibl>; HCh 243-245).</p>
<p>Numerous works of art were gathered together in this precinct, many
of which have been recovered, among them  the statues of the Tiber
(Louvre), the Nile (Vatican), the Ocean (Naples), and the lions (<bibl>BC 1890,
321-324</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1891, 25</bibl>) in the Vatican.  For statues, columns decorated
with reliefs, etc., found here, see Cap. 357-360; <bibl>RAP ii. 107-116</bibl>, 27 ;

<div xml:id="isis" type="entry">

<placeName>ISIS</placeName>

<p> a temple to which there is only one reference in ancient literature
(Hist. Aug. Trig. Tyr. 25: <foreign xml:lang="la">Tetricorum domus hodieque extat in monte
Caelio inter duos lucos contra Isium Metellinum pulcherrima</foreign>). The
<rs key="regio3" type="region">third region</rs> in the Regionary Catalogue is called Isis et Serapis, and on
the Haterii relief (Mon. d. Inst. v. pi. 7) is an arch with the inscription
<ref target="arcus-ad-isis" n="U">ARCUS AD ISIS</ref> (q.v.). This arch is evidently on the via Labicana. From
this evidence it is clear that a temple of Isis and Serapis stood in <rs key="regio3" type="region">Region III</rs>,
near the via Labicana, important enough to give its name to the region.
It was also called Isium, and was built or restored by some Metellus.
There is no indication of the date, but it was probably after the beginning
of the empire, and perhaps as late as the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>. In the time of
Constantine the name continued (Not. Reg. III). The name of this Isis
appears on one inscription that was found in the via Labicana near the
baths of Trajan (<bibl>CIL vi. 30915</bibl>; <foreign xml:lang="la">Isidi Lydiae educatrici valvas cum Anubi
et ara Mucianus</foreign> Aug. lib. proc.; PT 134).</p>
<p>The temple was in the south-east part of the region, but its exact
site is difficult to determine, for architectural and sculptural remains
which may well have belonged to such a shrine have been found scattered
over a considerable area of this section, from the via Labicana north to
beyond the via Macchiavelli (<bibl>BC 1875, 245</bibl>; <bibl>1886, 208</bibl>; <bibl>1887, 132-136</bibl>;

1889, 279-280</bibl>). The most probable site, however, is between S. Clemente
and SS. Pietro e Marcellino, near the western end of the latter, where
credible authorities state that in 1653 ruins of a temple decorated in
Egyptian style were found (for references, see HJ 304, n. 49).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See Add. p. xxii (the treatise is probably by G. P. Bellori). The drawings are at

<p>the temple of the deified Julius Caesar, authorised by the triumvirs in
<date value="-42">42 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 18</bibl>), but apparently built by Augustus alone
(Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 2</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> aedem divi Iuli ... feci</foreign>), and dedicated 18th August,
<date value="-29">29 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio li. 22</bibl>; Hemerol. Amit. Antiat. ad xv Kal. Sept.).
The body of Caesar was burnt at the east end of the forum, in front of
the Regia (Liv. ep. 116; Plut. Caes. 68), and here an altar was at once
<pb n="287"/>
erected (<foreign xml:lang="greek">bwmo/s</foreign>, App. <bibl>BC i. 4</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 148</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 2</bibl>), and a column of Numidian
marble twenty feet high inscribed Parenti Patriae (Suet. Caes. 85).
Column and altar were soon removed by Dolabella <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. also Cass. <bibl>Dio xliv. 50</bibl>. Caesar's veterans had some idea of replacing the altar
(Cic. ad <bibl>Fam. xi. 2</bibl>, <foreign xml:lang="la">veteranos de reponenda ara cogitare</foreign>), which may be identical with the

the altar. Cf. <bibl>CR 1899, 186</bibl>; and for the statue base in front of the temple, see <ref target="equus-tremuli" n="U">EQUUS

</note> (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. xiv. 15</bibl>;
<bibl>Phil. i. 5</bibl>), and it was on this site that the temple was afterwards built
(App. locc. citt.; Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 18</bibl>). From the evidence of coins,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> A coin (Cohen, Aug. 122; BM. Rep. ii. p. 14, 4356-7; Aug. 63) which Hilsen (HC 61)
refers to the curia, is thought to represent this temple by Mattingly (BM. p. cxxiii, n. 4)
but without good reason.
</note> the
temple was restored by Hadrian <bibl>(Cohen, Hadrien 416-419, 1388)</bibl>, but
the existing architectural fragments belong entirely to the original
structure (<bibl>Toeb. i. 5</bibl>). It had the right of asylum (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 19</bibl>),
and the Arval Brethren met there in <date value="69">69 A.D.</date> (Act. Arv. a. 69, Febr. 26,
<bibl>CIL vi. 2051</bibl>, 55).</p>
<p>A considerable part of the foundations, already uncovered (<bibl>LS ii. 197</bibl>),
and the evidence of the coins of Hadrian, enabled Richter in 1889 to
reconstruct the temple in its main lines (Jahr. d. <bibl>Inst. 1889, 137-162</bibl>;
Ant. <bibl>Denkmiler i. 27</bibl>, 28), and additional information was given by the
excavations of 1898-1899 (<bibl>CR 1899, 185</bibl>, 466; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 61-62</bibl>; <bibl>1905,
75-76</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1903, 81-83</bibl>; Atti 563-566). The temple consisted of two parts,
a rectangular platform 3.5 metres high, 26 wide, and about 30 long; and
on this the stylobate proper which rose 2.36 metres above the platform,
making the cella floor very high (Ov. ex <bibl>Ponto ii. 84</bibl>: divus ab excelsa
Iulius aede videt; <bibl>Met. xv. 842</bibl>), and was about 17 metres in width.
In the middle of the front of the platform is a semi-circular niche 8.3
metres in diameter, of which some of the peperino wall has been left in
place, and in this niche is a portion of the concrete core of a round altar
standing on the travertine slabs which formed the pavement of the forum
when the temple was built. The first altar therefore, which Dolabella
destroyed, must have been restored, and preserved in the niche of this
platform  when the temple itself was built. This platform  projected
beyond the stylobate on both sides for a distance of 7 metres, and the
projection was called rostra aedis divi Iuli (Frontin. de aq. 129; Cass.
Dio Ivi. 34: <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/mbola ta\ )*iouli/eia</foreign>) because the wall on both sides of the
niche was decorated with the beaks of the ships captured at Actium
(Cass. <bibl>Dio li. 19</bibl>) in a style similar to that of the old rostra. From this
rostra the emperors seem to have spoken frequently (Cass. Dio locc. citt.;
<bibl>liv. 35</bibl>; Suet. Aug. 100). There is some evidence in support of the view,
probable in itself, that Caesar had himself erected a second rostra at the
east end of the forum, which was represented by the rostra aedis divi
Iuli after the building of the temple (Liv. Ep. I 16; Richter, Gesch. d.
Rednerbiihne 52-53; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 167-168</bibl>, 171-172).
<pb n="288"/></p>
<p>The temple was Ionic, hexastyle, probably with antae, and pycnostyle,
that is, with intercolumnar spaces equal to one and a half diameters
(<bibl>Vitr. iii. 3</bibl>. 2; Stat. Silv. i. I. 22-24). The columns were 1.18 metres in
diameter at the base, and their height was nine times the diameter.
The cella occupied the whole width of the temple, about 17 metres.
The space between the two middle columns of the pronaos was wider
than that between the others, and within the cella, opposite its entrance
and this wide intercolumniation, stood a colossal statue <note anchored="true" place="foot"> See Hermes, 1875, 342-359, and supra, p. 226.
</note>of Caesar with a
comet or star on its head, perhaps that referred to by Pliny (<bibl>NH ii. 93-94</bibl>;
cf. Suet. Caes. 88, Ov. <bibl>Met. xv. 841-842</bibl> and Cass. <bibl>Dio xlv. 7</bibl>. I). In
this temple Augustus placed treasures from the spoil that he had taken
(Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 24</bibl>), and paintings of the Dioscuri, Victoria (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxv. 27</bibl>), and of Venus Anadyomene by Apelles (ib. 91). As this had
been injured by dampness, Nero replaced it by one by Dorotheus.
Remains of the concrete podium  and of the architectural decoration
still exist; but the concrete core has been almost entirely stripped
of the stone walls by which it was originally enclosed (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 406-409;

<p>Various explanations were given by the Roman antiquarians of the

the warning voice of the goddess, heard in the temple on the occasion
of an earthquake, '<foreign xml:lang="la"> ut sue plena procuratio fieret.</foreign>' Suidas (s.v. <foreign xml:lang="greek">*monh=ta</foreign>)
states that during the war with Tarentum the Romans, needing money,
obtained it by following the advice of Juno; and that in gratitude they
gave her the epithet Moneta and decided to establish the mint in her
<pb n="290"/>
temple. None of the explanations yet suggested is satisfactory, and
even the usual derivation of the word Moneta from moneo is open to
doubt (Walde, Etym. Worterb. 2nd ed. 493). The mint was in the temple
during the last centuries of the republic, perhaps established there in 269
when silver coinagewas introduced into Rome (<bibl>Liv. vi. 20</bibl>. 13; Cic. ad <bibl>Att.
viii. 7</bibl>. 3), and was called Moneta or ad Monetam. It seems to have been
removed at the <date value="99">end of the first century</date> (see Moneta), and nothing further
is heard of the temple (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 108-111; WR 190; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 592-594</bibl>,

<p>Not a trace of it has been found in the works for the erection of the
monument to Victor Emmanuel, and it may have occupied the site of
the transepts of the church of S. Maria in Aracoeli (Hilsen, Bilder aus

L. Julius, consul in <date value="-90">90 B.C.</date>, restored a temple of luno Sospita, in consequence of a dream of Caecilia, the daughter of Q. Caecilius Metellus
Balearicus, and it is probable that it is this temple of Iuno Sospita in
Rome that is meant rather than the more famous one at Lanuvium
(HJ 509-510; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 82</bibl>, 430; WR 188; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 596</bibl>). It was in
the forum Holitorium, and is generally identified with the smallest of the
three temples (though Frank prefers the central one-TF 126-130) that
lie side by side beneath the present church of S. Nicola in Carcere. These
temples have the same orientation, and the other two are those of <ref target="spes-aedes" n="U">SPES</ref>
and <ref target="ianus" n="U">IANUS</ref> (qq.v.). The smallest is of the Doric order, hexastyle,
amphiprostyle and peripteral, and built of travertine. Five of its
columns with portions of the entablature remain, built into the south
wall of the church (HJ 511-514; Delbriick, Die drei Tempel am Forum

<p>Nothing further is known of such a temple, and there is some difficulty
in explaining why a cult from  Lanuvium  was admitted within the

Mater with the <ref target="mater-matuta-aedes" n="U">MATER MATUTA</ref> (q.v.), and may be referring in this passage
to luno Sospita in the forum Holitorium. If this be so, however, that

This sacellum contained a marble altar with reliefs representing the

became emperor, he erected a large temple to Iuppiter Custos which may

<p>(templum, <bibl>Liv. i. 10</bibl>; Prop., Fest. 92; <foreign xml:lang="greek">new/s</foreign>,
Dionys., Cass. Dio):</p>
<p> a temple, said to have been the first in Rome,
on the Capitoline hill, erected and dedicated by Romulus to commemorate
his winning of the spolia opima from Acron, king of the Caeninenses, and
to serve as a repository for them (<bibl>Liv. i. 10</bibl>. 5-6; <bibl>iv. 20</bibl>. 3; Plut. Rom. 16;
<bibl>Dionys. ii. 34</bibl>; Val. <bibl>Max. iii. 2</bibl>. 3; Flor. i. I. ii; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vi. 859</bibl>;
CIL ia. 283, Elog. 22=x. 809). Twice afterwards these spoils were said
to have been won and placed in this temple-in <date value="-428">428 B.C.</date> when A. Cornelius
Cossus slew Lar Tolumnius, the king of Veii, and brought his spoils to
Rome (<bibl>Liv. iv. 20</bibl>; Fest. 189; Plut. Rom. 16; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vi. 859</bibl>;
Val. <bibl>Max. iii. 2</bibl>. 4; <bibl>Diodor. xii. 80</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. xii. 5</bibl>; Flor. i. I . 9; de vir.
ill. 25), and in 221 by C. Claudius Marcellus, who killed Viridomarus,
the Insubrian king (Liv. Ep. 20; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vi. 859</bibl>; <bibl>Prop. iv. 10</bibl>. 45;
Plut. Marc. 8; Rom. 16). This temple was probably within the later
limits of the area Capitolina, and was said to have been enlarged by
Ancus (<bibl>Liv. i. 33</bibl>. 8: amplificata), but was very small, for according to
Dionysius (ii. 34) it measured not more than 15 feet on the longest sides.
A denarius (Babelon, Claudia II; <bibl>BM.Rep. i. 567</bibl>, 4206-8) struck by
P. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus (<bibl>RE iv. 1390</bibl>) about <date value="-44">44 B.C.</date>, represents
Marcellus, the conqueror of Viridomarus and Syracuse, standing on the
high stylobate of a rectangular tetrastyle temple with the spolia opima
in his hand. The columns support an entablature with plain pediment.
This undoubtedly represents the actual structure before Augustus, but
it had been sadly neglected and had even lost its roof. At the suggestion
of Atticus, Augustus restored it, probably about <date value="-31">31 B.C.</date> (Nep. Att. 20. 3:<foreign xml:lang="la">ex quo accidit, cum aedes Iovis Feretri in Capitolio ab Romulo constituta
vetustate atque incuria detecta prolaberetur, ut Attici admonitu Caesar
ear reficiendam curaret</foreign>; Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 5</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. iv. 20</bibl>. 7). To Augustus
it seems that the right of depositing spoils that should be regarded as
spolia opima was then granted (Cass. <bibl>Dio. xliv. 4</bibl>. 3).</p>
<p>Dionysius, writing almost certainly after Augustus' restoration, says
(ii. 34):<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)/ti ga\r au)tou= sw/|zetai to\ a)raxai=on I)/xnos</foreign>, a statement that
seems open to three interpretations, either that the dimensions of the
<pb n="294"/>
restored temple were the same as those of the original (<bibl>Gilb. iii. 399</bibl>), or
that the second was larger and enclosed the earlier (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 47), or that
the lines of the earlier were simply marked on the floor of the later. The
statement of Cassius Dio (liv. 8) that Augustus built on the Capitol a
temple of <ref target="mars-ultor-aedes" n="U">MARS ULTOR</ref> (q.v.)<foreign xml:lang="greek">kata\ to\ tou= *dio\s *feretri/ou zh/lwma</foreign>, refers
only to the use of the new temple, not to its form, for it was round (Altm.
50).</p>
<p>There is no mention of any statue of the god in this temple but only
of a sceptre and flint (Fest. 92: <foreign xml:lang="la">ex cuius templo sumebant sceptrum per
quod iurarent et lapidem silicem quo foedus ferirent</foreign>, see below), an
evidence of its early date. Within the temple was an altar (<bibl>Prop. iv.
10</bibl>. 48:<foreign xml:lang="la"> hinc Feretri dictast ara superba Iovis</foreign>), unless this passage may
be interpreted as referring simply to the very first shrine.</p>
<p>Various explanations of the epithet feretrius were given by the
ancients, who derived it from fero, feretrum, the frame on which the
spolia were fixed, or from ferre pacem, or from ferire, either in the sense
of striking in battle or striking a victim in making a treaty-foedus ferire
(<bibl>Liv. i. 10</bibl>. 5; <bibl>Prop. iv. 10</bibl>. 46; Fest. 92; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 34</bibl>; Plut. Marc. 8,
Rom. 16), or they regarded it as equivalent to <foreign xml:lang="greek">u(perfere/ths</foreign> (Dionys. loc.
cit.:<foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ti pa/ntwn u(pere/xei</foreign>). It is probably connected with ferire, the
stroke of ritual as illustrated in foedus ferire, of which the silex in the
temple is evidence, and Iuppiter Feretrius was therefore equivalent to
Iuppiter Lapis, the latter used as a specially solemn oath-Cic. ep. vii.
12. 2; <bibl>Gell. i. 21</bibl>. 4 (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 47; <bibl>Gilb. i. 253-254</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 225-226</bibl>;

transverse lines of amphorae; the enclosure wall of the temenos wab also
formed, in part, of rows of amphorae which had, as it appears, some
unknown ritual significance. Two small rooms (one with arrangements
for ritual washing) were also found. Below was a large fishpond.
Interesting objects were found in a boundary ditch, which soon served

cited s.v. <ref target="lucus-furrinae" n="U">LUCUS FURRINAE</ref>, there is another altar (of uncertain provenance)
dedicated to Iuppiter Heliopolitanus and the Emperor Commodus on
29th November, <date value="186">186 A.D.</date>, by one M. Antonius Gaionas, who is called<foreign xml:lang="la">Cistiber  Augustorum  (?), i.e. quinque vir cis Tiberim</foreign>  (<bibl>CIL  vi.
420</bibl>=30764; cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1907, 244</bibl>). He also erected an altar found at
Porto (<bibl>CIL xiv. 24</bibl>)<foreign xml:lang="la"> I.O.M. Angelo Heliopolitano pro salute Imperatorum
Antonini et Commodi.</foreign></p>
<p>This Gaionas was already known from  his sepulchral inscription
(<bibl>IG xiv. 1512</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 32316</bibl>), where he is mentioned as <foreign xml:lang="greek"> ki/stiber</foreign> and as<foreign xml:lang="greek">dei/pnois krei/vas polla\ met) eu)frosu/nhs</foreign>.</p>
<p>A slab (mensa) with a dedication to Iuppiter Heliopolitanus pro salute
et reditu, et Victoria of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus (<date value="176">176 A.D.</date>, contemporary with the Antonine column and recording the same victories)
erected by the same Gaionas, was found used as building material in the
<dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> temple, as well as another undated dedication.</p>
<p>And, agreeably to this, one of the recently discovered inscriptions
speaks of him as <foreign xml:lang="greek">deipnokri/ths</foreign> ; see Cumont in <bibl>CRA 1917, 275-284</bibl>, who
interprets the difficult text <foreign xml:lang="greek">desmo\s o(/pws kratero/s qu=ma qeoi=s pare/xoi, o(\n dh\ *gaiwna=s deipnokri/ths e)/qeto</foreign>, which is carved on a marble slab (with a hole in
the centre communicating with a cavity which extends behind the whole
slab), by supposing that the slab was placed vertically at the end of a
basin, which contained fish to be consumed at the sacred banquets at
which he was a steward. Gauckler had indeed already supposed the
existence of a large fish-pond below the sanctuary even before the time
of Gaionas. The presence of a fine statue of Bacchus and a fragment
of a statuette is explained by Cumont to presume the use of wine to the
point of intoxication at the sacred banquets (op. cit. 281). A dedication
to Iuppiter Maleciabruditanus (i.e. the protecting deity of the city of
Jabruda in the Antilebanon) also came to light. Hiilsen, on the other
hand, points out that, had the slab stood vertically for a considerable
period, the calcareous deposit would have been heavier on the lower half
of the slab, instead of being, as it is, equally distributed: and he therefore
still explains it as the top of a treasure chest, with a hole for offerings,
supposing that it was used in a water tank after the destruction of the
sanctuary.</p>
<p>It would appear that the edifice of Gaionas was destroyed in or about
341, in consequence of the edicts of Constans and Constantius II, and that
a building consisting of porticos surrounding a fountain was erected on
its site. The most recent temple was thus, no doubt, erected in the
time of Julian the Apostate. The rectangular portico became the court
in the centre of the new temple.  (For the plan of the three superposed
temples, see Gauckler, Sanctuaire Syrien, pls. xxxv., I., li.; <bibl>CRA 1909,
617</bibl>, pi. i.; <bibl>1910, 378</bibl>, pls. i., ii).</p>
<p>On the east of it a smaller octagonal enclosure was built, in the centre
of which was a triangular mass of masonry-an altar which contained
<pb n="296"/>
a bronze statuette of a male deity, possibly Chronos, enveloped by a
serpent and surrounded by seven hen's eggs. On either side of the
enclosure were two smaller chapels.</p>
<p>At the west end of the court was a sanctuary with a plan like that of
a basilica-narthex, nave and two aisles. In the apse was the statue
of Iuppiter Heliopolitanus, and in the cavity beneath, the upper part of a
human cranium, the relic of a dedicatory sacrifice. It has further been
noticed by Gauckler that the head of the statue of Bacchus and two other
heads had been ' segmented,' i.e. sliced at the crown; but whether this
has any ritualistic significance, as Gauckler believed, is doubted by Crawford (Mem. Amer. <bibl>Acad. i. 103-119</bibl>). Several tombs were also found in
the sanctuary, which may have been those of individuals who had been
sacrificed.</p>
<p>The objects found have been removed to the Museo delle Terme
(PT 120-122), but no further work has been undertaken by the Italian
Government.</p>

Arv. ad Kal. Sept., CIL i. p. 214, 328, where the name appears as Iuppiter
Liber). Ti. Sempronius, consul in <date value="-238">238 B.C.</date>, had built and dedicated a
temple of Libertas on the Aventine, out of the proceeds of fines, in which
his son placed a painting of the celebration of the victory of Beneventum

<p>* templum, <foreign xml:lang="greek">new/s</foreign>, also
called aedes Capitolina (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiii. 16</bibl>, 19; <bibl>xxxv. 14</bibl>; <bibl>xxxvi. 45</bibl>):</p>
<p>the great temple on the Capitol, dedicated to Jupiter and his companion
deities, Juno and Minerva, the Capitoline Triad. Tarquinius Priscus
vowed this temple while battling with the Sabines, and seems to have laid
some of its foundations, but a large part of the work was done by Tarquinius Superbus, who is said to have nearly completed it. According
to the tradition current in later times, there were shrines of other deities
on the site intended for this temple, all of whom allowed themselves to
be dispossessed in the proper way except <ref target="terminus-fanum" n="U">TERMINUS</ref> (q.v.) and <ref target="iuventas-aedicula" n="U">IUVENTAS</ref>
(q.v.). These shrines were therefore incorporated in the new temple,
and the action of Terminus was regarded as a prophecy of the permanence
of the cult and of Rome itself (Cic. de rep. ii. 36; <bibl>Liv. i. 38</bibl>. 7, 55, 56;
Plin. <bibl>NH iii. 70</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 69</bibl>; <bibl>iv. 61</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 72</bibl>; Plut. Popl.
13-14). The dedication of the temple on 13th September was ascribed to
the first year of the republic, when this honour fell to Horatius Pulvillus
by lot (<bibl>Liv. ii. 8</bibl>; <bibl>vii. 3</bibl>. 8; <bibl>Polyb. iii. 22</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 72</bibl>; Plut. Popl.
14; cf. Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiii. 19</bibl>).</p>
<p>The original structure was probably built of the native tufa of the
hill, which cropped out at the foot of the Capitoline on the forum side
(<bibl>AJA 1918, 185</bibl>). During the digging for the foundations a caput humanum integra facie (<bibl>Liv. i. 55</bibl>. 5) was found, and this the Etruscan diviners
interpreted as an omen of Rome's sovereignty of the world (Varro, <bibl>LL
v. 4</bibl>  ; <bibl>Plin. xxxiii. 15</bibl> ; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 345</bibl>; <bibl>Arnob. vi. 7</bibl>; <bibl>Isid. xv. 2</bibl>. 31;
Cass. Dio, frg. ii. 8).</p>
<p>There were three cellae side by side. That in the middle was
<pb n="298"/>
dedicated to Jupiter and contained a terra cotta statue of the god, with
a thunderbolt in his right hand, said to have been the work of Vulca of
Veii, the face of which was painted red on festival days (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i.
201-202</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiii. 11-112</bibl> ; <bibl>xxxv. 157</bibl>). The character of this
statue, and of the rest of the decoration of the temple, is clear from the
life-size figures, recently discovered at Veii, belonging to a group representing the stealing by Heracles of a stag sacred to Apollo (<bibl>NS 1919, 3</bibl>)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See also Ant. <bibl>Denk. iii. 45-55</bibl>.
</note>. The
chamber on the right was dedicated to Minerva (<bibl>Liv. vii. 3</bibl>. 5), and that
on the left to Juno.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The cella Iunonis Reginae is mentioned in Act. Lud. Saec. Sev. (<bibl>CIL vi. 32329</bibl>. 9).
</note> Probably there were statues also in these two
chambers, and each deity had her own altar (Varro ap. Serv. <bibl>Aen. iii. 134</bibl>).
The statue of Jupiter was clothed with a tunic adorned with palm branches
and Victories (tunica palmata), and a purple toga embroidered with gold
(toga picta, palmata), the costume afterwards worn by Roman generals
when celebrating a triumph (<bibl>Liv. x. 7</bibl>. IO; <bibl>xxx. 15</bibl>. II-12; <bibl>Iuv. x. 38</bibl>;
Hist. Aug. Alex. 40; Gord. 4; Prob. 7; Fest. 209; Serv. <bibl>Aen. xi. 334</bibl>;
Marquardt, Privatl. 542-543 ; cf. <bibl>SR ii. 1914</bibl>, 254-256). The entablature
was of wood, and on the apex of the pediment was a terra cotta group,
Jupiter in a quadriga, by the same Etruscan artist as the statue in the
cella (Plin. <bibl>NH xxviii. 16</bibl>; <bibl>xxxv. 157</bibl>; Fest. 274; Plut. Popl. 13).
This was replaced in <date value="-296">296 B.C.</date> by another, probably of bronze (<bibl>Liv. x. 23</bibl>.
12). There is no doubt that pediment and roof were decorated with
terra cotta figures, among them  a statue of Summanus 'in fastigio'
(perhaps therefore an acroterion), the head of which was broken off by
a thunderbolt in <date value="-275">275 B.C.</date> (Cic. de <bibl>Div. i. 10</bibl>; Liv. Epit. xiv.). See
<bibl>BC 1923, 304</bibl>; <bibl>1925, 161-169</bibl>, 191-200; <bibl>JRS 1914, 183</bibl>; Van Buren,
Terracotta Revetments, 47. In <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> the aediles M. Aemilius Lepidus
and L. Aemilius Paullus placed gilt shields on the pediment (<bibl>Liv. xxxv. 10</bibl>).</p>
<p>In <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> the walls and columns were covered anew with stucco
(<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>. 3), and a copy of the dedicatory inscription of L. Aemilius
Regillus, from the temple of the <ref target="lares-permarini-aedes" n="U">LARES PERMARINI</ref> (q.v.), was placed
over the door (ib. 52). A little later a mosaic pavement was laid in the
cella (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 185</bibl>), and in 142 the ceiling was gilded (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxiii. 57</bibl>). The temple stood in the <ref target="area-capitolina" n="U">AREA CAPITOLINA</ref> (q.v.), and in
front of the steps was the great altar of Jupiter (ara Iovis), where solemn
sacrifices were offered at the beginning of the year, at the celebration of
triumphs, and on some other occasions (Suet. Aug. 94; Zonaras viii. I;
Fest. 285). This temple became a repository of works of art of many
sorts, the gifts of Roman generals and foreigners, as well as of dedicatory
offerings and trophies of victory (see <bibl>Rosch. ii. 728-730</bibl>; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 16-18),
of which the earliest recorded was a golden crown presented by the
Latins in <date value="-459">459</date> (<bibl>Liv. ii. 22</bibl>. 6). The number of these became so great that
in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> it was necessary to remove some of the statues and many of
the shields affixed to the columns (<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>. 3).
<pb n="299"/></p>
<p>This first temple was burned to the ground on 6th July, <date value="-83">83 B.C.</date>
(Cic. <bibl>Cat. iii. 9</bibl>; Sail. Cat. 47. 2; Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 72</bibl>; App. <bibl>BC i. 83</bibl>, 86;
Obseq. 57; Plut. Sulla 27; Cassiod. ad a. 671), with the statue of Jupiter
(Plut. de Iside 71 ; cf. Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 201</bibl>), and the Sibylline books that had
been kept in a stone chest (<bibl>Dionys. iv. 62</bibl>), but the temple treasure was
carried in safety to Praeneste by the younger Marius (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiii. 16</bibl>).
The rebuilding was taken in hand by Sulla (Val. <bibl>Max. ix. 3</bibl>. 8; Tac. <bibl>Hist.
iii. 72</bibl>), who is said to have brought the white marble Corinthian columns
of the Olympieion in Athens to Rome for this temple (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 45</bibl>).
They do not seem  to have been used, for coins of <date value="-43">43 B.C.</date> <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Add a coin of the gens Volteia (Babelon, ii. 565 ; BM. <bibl>Rep. i. 388</bibl>. I, where it is dated
after <date value="-83">83 B.C.</date>). The temple was areostyle, and its pediment was dedicated 'tuscanico
more,' probably with statues of gilt bronze (<bibl>Vitr. iii. 3</bibl>. 35, quoted on p. 255). See <bibl>BC 1925, 169-176</bibl>. It is also represented, with its lofty podium, on one of the Boscoreale cups
(Mon. Piot, v. <bibl>(1899)</bibl> pl. xxxvi. 2; Rostowzew, History of the Ancient World, ii. Rome,
186), where an eagle is clearly visible in the pediment.
</note> (Babelon,
ii. 291, Pet. 1-4; BM. <bibl>Rep. i. 571</bibl>. 4217-25) represent those standing
as Doric. Most of the rebuilding fell to the lot of Q. Lutatius Catulus,
being assigned to him by the senate (Cic. <bibl>Verr. iv. 69</bibl>; Varro ap. <bibl>Gell.
ii. 10</bibl>; Lactant. de ira dei 22. 6; Suet. Caes. 15), and the new structure
was dedicated by him in 69 (Liv. ep. 98; Plut. Popl. 15; cf. Plin. <bibl>NH
vii. 138</bibl>; <bibl>xix. 23</bibl>; Suet. Aug. 94).  Catulus' name was inscribed above
the entrance (Tac. <bibl>Hist. iii. 72</bibl>) and remained there until <date value="69">69 A.D.</date>, so that
the vote of the senate to substitute Caesar's name, after the dictator's
death (Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 14</bibl>; cf. xxxvii. 44), was not carried out. This
temple was built on the original foundations (Tac. loc. cit.) and plan,
except that it was higher (Val. <bibl>Max. iv. 4</bibl>. II), more expensive (<bibl>Dionys.
iv. 61</bibl>), and doubtless more splendid. The greater height of the temple
was not in harmony with that of the stylobate, and Catulus wished to
remedy this fault by lowering the level of the area Capitolina. This,
however, could not be done because of the favissae, or underground
passages which were entered from the cella of the temple, and in which
were stored the old statues that had fallen from the roof, and various
dedicatory gifts (Fest. 88; Gell. ii. io; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 419</bibl>; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 710</bibl>).
The kind of stone employed is not known. The roof was supported by
eagles ' <foreign xml:lang="la">vetere ligno</foreign> ' (Tac. loc. cit.), and covered with plates of gilt bronze
(Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiii. 57</bibl>; Sen. <bibl>Contr. i. 6</bibl>. 4; ii. I. I). The denarius referred
to above shows Roma standing on shields between two birds, with the
wolf and twins on the right (cf. Cass. Dio xlv. i ; Suet. Aug. 94), and on
the apex a statue of Jupiter in a quadriga. The ancient terra cotta
statue of Jupiter seems to have been replaced by one of gold and ivory,
in sitting posture (Joseph. Ant. Iud. xix. I. 2), made probably by some
Greek artist, perhaps Apollonius, in imitation of that of Zeus at Olympia
(Chalcid. in Plat. Tim. 338 c; Brunn, <bibl>Kunstlergeschichte il. 543</bibl>=12.
379). Catulus also dedicated a statue to Minerva, infra Capitolium
(Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 77</bibl>). Cf. CIL i². 725, 730-732=vi. 30920-4 for dedicatory

inscriptions set up at this temple. <bibl>Whether vi. 30928</bibl> (with which go
30921, 30923; cf. ib. is. 732) belonged to it or to the <ref target="capitolium-vetus" n="U">CAPITOLIUM VETUS</ref>
(q.v.) cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Lightning frequently struck on the Capitol and did much damage,
probably to the temple itself (Cic. <bibl>Cat. iii. 19</bibl>; de <bibl>Div. i. 20</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 45</bibl>;
Cass. <bibl>Dio xli. 14</bibl>; <bibl>xlii. 26</bibl>; <bibl>xlv. 17</bibl>; <bibl>xlvii. 10</bibl>), and Augustus restored
it at great expense, probably about <date value="-26">26 B.C.</date>, but without placing his own
name upon it (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 9</bibl>). It is thrice mentioned in the Acta Lud.
Saec. (<bibl>CIL vi. 32323</bibl>. 9, 29, 70). Further injury by lightning is recorded
in <date value="-9">9 B.C.</date> (Cass. Dio Iv. I) and <date value="56">56 A.D.</date> (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiii. 24</bibl>).</p>
<p>In <date value="69">69 A.D.</date> the second temple, though ungarrisoned and unplundered,
was burned when the Capitol was stormed by the Vitellians (Tac. <bibl>Hist.
iii. 71</bibl>; Suet. Vit. 15; Cass. Diolxiv. 17; Stat. <bibl>Silv. v. 3</bibl>. 195-200; Hier.
a. Abr. 2089), and rebuilt by Vespasian on its original lines but with still
greater height (Tac. <bibl>Hist. iv. 4</bibl>, 9, 53; Suet. Vesp. 8; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxv. 7</bibl>. I ;
Plut. Popl. 15; Aur. Vict. Caes. 9. 7; ep. de Caes. 9. 8; <bibl>Zon. xi. 17</bibl>).
Coins of the period <note anchored="true" place="foot"> See <bibl>BC 1925, 176-181</bibl>.
</note> agree in representing this temple as hexastyle, with
Corinthian columns, and statues of Jupiter, Juno (left), and Minerva
(right), in the three central intercolumniations, but they differ in the
number and position of the figures surmounting the pediment-quadrigae,
eagles, heads of horses, and objects of an uncertain character (Cohen,
Vesp. 486-493; Titus 242-245; Dom. 533; for a list of coins representing
the temple at different periods, see Arch. Zeit. i 872, 1-8; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 88-90).</p>
<p>This temple was again burned down in <date value="80">80 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 24</bibl>)
and restored by Domitian (Suet. Dom. 5; Plut. Popl. 15; <bibl>Eutrop.
vii. 23</bibl>; Chron. 146), although the actual work was apparently begun in
80 (Act. Arv. Henzen, cvi. 115-116). The dedication probably took
place in 82 (Cohen, Dom. 230; Hier. a. Abr. 2105, wrongly).  This
structure surpassed the earlier in magnificence. It was hexastyle, of
the Corinthian order, and its columns were of white Pentelic marble, a
material used in no other Roman building (Plut. Popl. 15). The doors
were plated with gold (<bibl>Zos. v. 38</bibl>), and the roof was covered with gilt
tiles (Procop. b. <bibl>Vand. i. 5</bibl>). The four bronze columns made of the rostra
of the ships captured at Antium, which Domitian set up 'in Capitolio'
(Serv. <bibl>Georg. iii. 29</bibl>), perhaps stood in this temple. The pediment was
adorned with reliefs, and its apex and gables with statues, as in the earlier
temples, but for them we must depend on the evidence of coins (Cohen,
Dom. 23, 174) and fragments of reliefs or drawings of the same, as e.g.
one in the Louvre from the forum of Trajan, in which the part showing
the pediment is lost (<bibl>PBS iv. 230</bibl>, 240-244; cf. Ml6. 1889, 120-123;
<bibl>Mitt. 1888, 150</bibl> 155; <bibl>1889, 250-252</bibl>; and <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 89-90; <bibl>Rosch.

Kaiserzeit, 125.

<p>This temple is referred to in glowing terms by Ammianus (xvi. 10. 14;
<bibl>xxii. 16</bibl>. 12) and Ausonius (Clar. urb. xix. 17: aurea Capitoli culmina).
Its destruction began in the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> when Stilicho carried off the
gold plates of the doors (<bibl>Zos. v. 38</bibl>). The inscription said to have been
found on this occasion was simply a graffito, carelessly read, which is
restored by Reinach: Niger, Q. Regii ser(vus) (<bibl>CRA 1914, 562</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> As Hillsen points out, however, Niger is not a slave's name, nor is Regius a gentilicium.

In 571, however, Narses appears to have removed the statues, or many
of them: Chron. <bibl>Min. i. 336</bibl> (571),<foreign xml:lang="la"> p. c. lustini Aug. iiii anno. De Neapolim
egressus Narsis ingressus Romam et deposuit palatii eius statuam et
Capitolium </foreign> (see <bibl>BCr 1867, 22</bibl>; Hilsen cit.)  The bull of Anacletus I
(1130-8) refers to it as templum maius quod respicit super Alafantum
(v. <ref target="elephas-herbarius" n="U">ELEPHAS HERBARIUS</ref>). The history of its destruction is little known

given by Vitruvius (iii. 3. 5) and Dionysius (iv. 61), have established the
general plan of the temple, which remained the same for the successive
rebuildings (cf. Delbruck, Der Apollotempel auf dem Marsfeld in Rom,
<bibl>Rome 1903, 12-13</bibl>). The temple was rectangular, almost square, and
fronted south, its main axis deviating about 261 degrees to the east of
the north and south line. The stylobate seems not to have been a solid
mass, but it consisted of parallel walls, 5.60 metres wide, made of tufa
blocks laid without mortar and set deep in the ground. Considerable
remains of it are visible in the Museo Mussolini, which occupies the former
Palazzo Caffarelli. Its height was apparently from 4 to 5 metres. The
proportion in width between the central chamber of the cella and those
on the sides was as four to three. The length of the shorter sides of the
stylobate, derived from actual measurement, exclusive of its outer facing
of which nothing is known, was about 55 metres, and that of the longer
sides about 60 metres. (For a discussion of the evidence of the use of

foundations, see Hermes, 1887, 17-28; <bibl>1888, 477-479</bibl>; Richter, 122-123;

<p>Paribeni (<bibl>NS 1921, 38-49</bibl>) gives a new plan based on recent excavations
in which three angles <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The fourth angle is to be seen in the Piazzetta della Rupe Tarpea, off the Via Tor
de' Specchi (see infra, p. 351).

the measurements given above.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For another see Capitolium, i. 321-326.
</note> He points out that if we can suppose
that Dionysius (who tells us that the perimeter of the temple was 8 plethra
(800 Greek feet), that each side was about 200 feet, and that the difference
between length and breadth did not exceed 15 feet) was using the older
Greek foot of 296 mm. or thereabouts, corresponding to the Roman foot
(the Greek foot of 308 mm. being really the Ptolemaic foot; cf. Segr6 in
<bibl>Aegyptus i. 159</bibl>), we get a measurement of 61.42 by 56.98 metres, which,
allowing for the facing, agrees very closely with the measurements given
above. If ve supposed the Italic foot to have been used, we should
get 59.77 by 55.60 metres, which is rather too small, as nothing is allowed
for facing. The podium is that of the original temple (YW 1922-3, 98).
No more of the parallel walls of the stylobate have been found.</p>
<p>The temple was hexastyle, with three rows of columns across the front
and a single row on each side, and the intercolumnar spaces corresponded
with the different widths of the three adjacent cellae. As the bases
of the columns were about 8 feet (2.23 m.) in breadth, the wider intercolumniations measured 40 feet (11.12 m.) and the narrower 30 feet
(8.9 m.). According to these measurements the cella was 100  feet
(27.81 m.) square. Of the superstructure only fragments now exist,
a drum of a fluted column of Pentelic marble, 2.10 metres in diameter,
part of an Attic base of the same stone, 2.26 metres in breadth, the
lower half of a Corinthian capital (<bibl>NS 1897, 60</bibl>), although fragments
of cornice and frieze with sculptured reliefs are reported to have been
found (LR 300-301 ; <bibl>BC 1914, 88-89</bibl>). Cf. DAP 2. xv. 372-3 for the
removal, as it seems, of another column in 1544-6. It is very remarkable
that so little of any of the subsequent temples has been found.</p>
<p>This temple was the centre of the religious system of the state during
the republic and empire, and possessed great political importance. Here
the consuls offered their first public sacrifices, the senate met in solemn
assembly, it was the destination of the triumphal procession, and the
repository of archives dealing with foreign relations. To the Romans
it was the symbol of the sovereignty and power of Rome, and of her
immortality. (For a catalogue of the uses of this temple, see <bibl>Rosch. ii.

<p> a temple vowed, according to
tradition (<bibl>BC 1917, 79-84</bibl>), by Romulus at the critical moment in the
battle between the Romans and the Sabines when the former had been
driven across the forum valley to the porta Mugonia (<bibl>Liv. i. 12</bibl>. 3-6;
ps. Cic. orat. pr.<foreign xml:lang="la"> quam in exilium iret</foreign> 24; Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 794</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys.
ii. 50</bibl>; Flor. i. I. 13; de vir. ill. 2. 8). The epithet stator appears in
Greek as <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)pqw/sios</foreign> (Dionys.) and <foreign xml:lang="greek">sth/sios</foreign> (App. Plut.). This temple
was never built, but in <date value="-294">294 B.C.</date> the consul, M. Atilius Regulus, made a
similar vow under similar circumstances in a battle with the Samnites,
and erected the temple immediately afterwards (<bibl>Liv. x. 36</bibl>. II, 37. 15).
Livy explains that no actual building had been put up by Romulus,
but <foreign xml:lang="la">fanum tantum, id est locus templo effatus</foreign>-an attempt to reconcile
fact with what had evidently become the popular tradition (Cic. <bibl>Cat.
i. 33</bibl> ; ps. Cic. loc. cit.). Its site is variously indicated-<foreign xml:lang="la">in Palatii radice,

41</bibl>. 4; Plin. <bibl>NH	xxxiv. 29</bibl>; App. BC ii. ii), and Not. places it in
<rs key="regio4" type="region">Region IV</rs>. It is represented on the relief of the Haterii (Mon. d. <bibl>Inst. v.
7</bibl>) as hexastyle, of the Corinthian order, and facing the clivus Palatinus.</p>
<p>Cicero called the senate together in this temple (Cic. <bibl>Cat. ii. 12</bibl> ; ps.
Cic. loc. cit.; Plut. Cic. 16), which was probably not unusual; and in
<pb n="304"/>
it was kept what was evidently a bit of liturgy composed by Livius
Andronicus (<bibl>Liv. xxvii. 37</bibl>. 7). The day of dedication is given by Ovid
(<bibl>Fast. vi. 793</bibl>) as 27th January, but this may perhaps be that of a later
restoration, and not of Regulus' temple (WR 122-123). In fact, we
learn from  Fast. Ant. ap. NS 1921, I I, that either this temple or that
in the porticus Metelli was dedicated on 5th September; and, as Hemer.
Urb. (cited below) associates that temple with that of luno Regina,
the reference in Fast. Ant. may be taken to be to the temple now
under discussion. Two inscriptions of the later empire (<bibl>CL vi. 434</bibl>,
435) probably belong to this temple, and it is mentioned in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth
century</dateRange> (Not.).</p>
<p>Just east of the arch of Titus, a site corresponding with the literary
references, are ruins consisting of a large rectangular platform of concrete,
on which are some enormous blocks of peperino and travertine (Hermes,
1885, 412). On this foundation the mediaeval turris Cartularia was
built (for the explanation of this name, see Rend. dei <bibl>Lincei 1912,
767-772</bibl>; <bibl>AJA 1913, 569</bibl>),<note anchored="true" place="foot"> In brief, it derived its name not from the fact that it ever contained the papal archives,
but from its proximity to the building in which they were kept, which was itself situated on
the Palatine. Cf. also <bibl>Roma vi. (1928) 97</bibl>, 98.
</note> which was not torn down until 1829. This
foundation has generally been identified as that of the temple of Iuppiter
Stator of the Flavian period (LR 200; HC 250-252; <bibl>CR 1905, 75</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1903, 18</bibl>; <bibl>1914, 93</bibl>; <bibl>1917, 79-84</bibl>; TF 89; DR  178-182; RE  <bibl>Suppl.
iv. 480</bibl>, 481). Some tufa walls, recently excavated close to the north-
east side of the arch and beneath its foundations, may have belonged to
the temple at an earlier date when its position was slightly different
(<bibl>YW   1908, 23</bibl>; <bibl>CR  1909, 61</bibl>), but the supposition is very doubtful.
Others have sought it on the area Palatina, but wrongly (HJ 22).</p>
<p>For a republican inscription on some blocks of tufa there (not on our
site), see CIL i'. 1009=vi. 29842 (cf. 36615). It bears the names of two
Greek artificers Philocrates and Diodes.  See HJ 20-23; <bibl>Rosch. ii.

<p>(templum, Pliny):</p>
<p> a temple which, with that
of Iuno Regina and the enclosing <ref target="porticus-metelli" n="U">PORTICUS METELLI</ref> (q.v.), was built by
Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus after his triumph in <date value="-146">146 B.C.</date> (Vell.
i.  I. 3). It is referred to as aedes Iovis Metellina (Fest. 363) and aedes
Metelli (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 40</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 8708</bibl>). It was inside the porticus
Metelli (<bibl>Vitr. iii. 2</bibl>. 5), close to the circus Flaminius (<bibl>Macrob. iii. 4</bibl>. 2;
Hemer. Urb., CIL i'. p. 252, 339), and its exact site is known, beneath the
church of S. Maria in Campitelli. The temple of Juno was just west of
this, on the opposite side of the Via della Tribuna di Campitelli. It is
not stated in so many words by Velleius (loc. cit.) that Metellus built
both temples, but this is the natural inference from the passage.  He is
also said to have been the first to build a temple in Rome entirely of marble,
and this statement probably applies to both structures. In front of the
<pb n="305"/>
temples Metellus placed Lysippus' equestrian statues of Alexander's
generals, and in them were a number of famous works of art (Fest. 363;
Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 24</bibl>, 34, 40). According to Vitruvius (iii. 2. 5) the temple
of Jupiter was the work of Hermodorus of Salamis (<bibl>RE viii. 861-862</bibl>), and
was an example of a peripteros with six columns across the front and
rear and eleven on the sides. The space between the columns was
equal to that between the columns and the wall of the cella.  As
there were no inscriptions on the temples (Veil. loc. cit.) and evidently
representations of a lizard and a frog among the decorations (<foreign xml:lang="greek">sau/ra, ba/traxos</foreign>), the legend arose that the architects were two Spartans, Saurus
and Batrachus; and further that, as the decorations in the temple of
Jupiter belonged to that of Juno, and vice versa, the statues of the
deities had been set up in the wrong cellae by the mistake of the workmen
(Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 42-43</bibl>; <bibl>RE iii. 145</bibl>). The idea that an Ionic capital
now in S. Lorenzo fuori has anything to do with these temples has
generally been abandoned (HJ 539, n. 87).</p>
<p>After <date value="-14">14 B.C.</date> Augustus either rebuilt the porticus Metelli, or replaced
it by the <ref target="porticus-octaviae" n="U">PORTICUS OCTAVIAE</ref> (q.v.), and presumably restored the enclosed
temples at the same time. That of Jupiter is mentioned on an undated
inscription of the empire (<bibl>CIL vi. 8708</bibl> :<foreign xml:lang="la"> aedituus de aede Iovis porticus
Octaviae</foreign>), and it is included under the rubric Aedes of <rs key="regio9" type="region">Region IX</rs> in
Not. (om. Cur.). The temples are also represented on a fragment (33)
of the Marble Plan, that of Juno as hexastyle prostyle, and that of
Jupiter as hexastyle and peripteral but with ten columns on a side instead
of eleven, as Vitruvius says it had (see above). This discrepancy may
perhaps be explained as due to some changes made by Augustus' restoration. Lugli (ZA 229) maintains that, like the porticus Octaviae, they
were restored by Severus.</p>
<p>The existing ruins of both temples are concealed for the most part by
modern houses in the Via di S. Angelo in Pescheria, and consist chiefly
of substructures and walls of travertine and  of brickwork, with
fragments of marble columns and entablature. Three fluted columns
of white marble belonging to the temple of Juno, 12.50 metres in height
and 1.25 in diameter, with Corinthian capitals and entablature, are
visible in No. I  of that street. Of the history of these temples after
the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>, nothing is known (HJ 538-540; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 684-686</bibl>.

translation of <foreign xml:lang="greek">*zeu\s brontw=n</foreign> (Cass. Dio loc. cit.), which form  appears
in a Latin transliteration in two inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 432</bibl>, 2241). It was
famous for its magnificence (Suet. Aug. 29: inter opera praecipua),
with walls of solid marble (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 50</bibl>), and contained some
notable works of art (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 78</bibl>, 79). Augustus visited this
temple frequently, and on one occasion is said to have dreamed that
Jupiter complained that the popularity of this new temple had sensibly
diminished the number of worshippers in the great temple of the god.
Whereupon Augustus replied that Jupiter Tonans was only the doorkeeper
of Jupiter Capitolinus, and proceeded to hang bells on the gables of
the former to indicate this relationship (Suet. Aug. 9  ; cf. <bibl>Mart. vii. 60</bibl>. 1 :
<foreign xml:lang="la">Tarpeiae venerande rector aulae</foreign>). This shows that the temple must
have stood quite close to the entrance of the area Capitolina, and
therefore on the south-east edge of the hill overlooking the forum (cf
Claud. de sext. cons. Hon. 44-46, which probably refers to this temple;
<bibl>RhM  1872, 269-274</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Perhaps the foundation found in x896 belongs to it (see <ref target="iuppiter-conservator-sacellum" n="U">IUPPITER CONSERVATOR</ref>);

<p> In the battle of Sentinum, <date value="-295">295 B.C.</date>, the dictator,
Q. Fabius Maximus Rullianus, vowed a temple (aedes) to Iuppiter Victor,
to whom he afterwards offered the spoils collected from the Samnites in
sacrifice (<bibl>Liv. x. 29</bibl>. 14, 18). Livy's statement (x. 42. 7) that in <date value="-293">293</date>
L. Papirius, at the battle of Aquilonia, vowed a cup of new wine to
luppiter Victor, is sometimes interpreted as meaning that Fabius' temple
had been dedicated by that time, but this is quite hypothetical. According to Ovid (<bibl>Fast. iv. 621</bibl>) and Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 92</bibl>, the day of
dedication of the temple (templa) was the Ides of April. Josephus states
(Ant. <bibl>Iud. xix. 4</bibl>. 3) that after the murder of Caligula in <date value="41">41 A.D.</date> the consuls
summoned the senate <foreign xml:lang="greek">ei)s to\ i(ero\n tou= nikhfo/rou *dio/s</foreign>; and Cassius Dio

<pb n="307"/>
in <rs key="regio10" type="region">Region X</rs> in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> in the Notitia (Curiosum om. Victoris).
If so, the temple was on the Palatine, but this depends solely on the
Notitia (<bibl>BC 1917, 84-92</bibl>, where it is maintained to be of very early origin).</p>
<p>Among the prodigies of <date value="-42">42 B.C.</date> the striking of lightning <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)s to\n tou= *nikai/ou *dio\s bwmo/nes </foreign> is reported (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlvii. 40</bibl>. 2), evidently an

not perfectly clear (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 50), but it is sometimes regarded as
evidence for the existence of a shrine of Iuppiter Victor on the Capitoline,
although probably wrongly. An inscription found on the Quirinal (<bibl>CIL il.

century copy, which is our only source for the inscription. <bibl>CIL vi. 475</bibl> (P. Corn. v. f. coso.

is also believed to prove the existence of a shrine of the same god
on that hill, but the whole question of the temple or temples of
Iuppiter Victor is still unsettled, and the uncertainty is increased by
Ovid's statement (<bibl>Fast. vi. 650</bibl>) that on the Ides of June <foreign xml:lang="la">invicto sunt
data templa Iovi</foreign>. Invictus is a less frequent cognomen, occurring in

cannot, in any case, be that referred to by Ovid in the earlier passage
(see above). No identification of the Palatine temple with any existing
remains is now tenable (HJ 50; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 679-681</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 427</bibl>;

on a terrace erected by Hadrian, which Alexander Severus transformed
into a shrine of Juppiter Ultor, and that it was called Pentapylon, because
of its appearance; the name occurs in Not. (Reg. X). This hypothesis
cannot be said to be convincing (Geogr. <bibl>Jahrb. xxxiv. 206</bibl>; DAP 2.
xi. 117; cf. Mem. Linc. 5. xvii. 530), and the difficulty is, that the
remains of brick-faced concrete at the edge of the hill belong to the
time of Domitian (see <ref target="adonaea" n="U">ADONAEA, DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>), even if we reject

<p> the first temple of this goddess in Rome, was built by
Q. Lutatius Catulus in the campus Martius (Serv. <bibl>Aen. xii. 139</bibl>). This
was probably the victor in the First Punic War rather than the contemporary of Sulla and builder of the Tabularium. The temple stood
near the spot where the later aqua Virgo ended (Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 463</bibl>), that
is, the north side of the Saepta, the modern Piazza di S. Ignazio (cf.
however, <bibl>LS iii. 124</bibl>), and there is not the least possibility that a

speaks of gilded statues being set up in this temple (pro Clu. ioi) and its
day of dedication was 11th January (Ov. loc. cit.; Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS

<placeName>LACUS CURTIUS</placeName>
</head>
<p> the name attached to a structure in the middle of the
forum (Plaut. Cure. 477), of which the remains are now visible. Three
explanations of the origin and meaning of this name were current in
Rome. One was that at the beginning of the regal period, a chasm
suddenly opened in the middle of the forum valley, which could be
closed, the soothsayers said, only by the sacrifice of that ' <foreign xml:lang="la">quo plurimum
populus Romanus posset</foreign>.' Thereupon a youth named Curtius leaped in
and the opening closed (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 148</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. vii. 6</bibl>; Val. <bibl>Max. v. 6</bibl>. 2;
Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 78</bibl>; Fest. 49; Cass. Dio fr. 30. I; <bibl>Zonaras vii. 25</bibl>; Suidas
ii. I. 572 ; <bibl>Oros. iii. 5</bibl>). Another story was that the swamp in the centre
of the forum was called lacus Curtius from the Sabine Mettius Curtius
who rode his horbe into it when hard pressed by the Romans and escaped
(<bibl>Liv. i. 12</bibl>. 9, 13. 5; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 149</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 42</bibl>; <bibl>xiv. 11</bibl>; Plut.
Rom. 18). This is the story that is represented on a relief, found in 1553
between the column of Phocas and the temple of Castor and preserved
in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (Museo Mussolini), which is itself a
late copy of an original of perhaps the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange> (<bibl>Mitt. 1902,
322-329</bibl>;  S. Sculpt. 324-326;  SScR  316-318;  Cons. 36). For the
inscription on the other side, see <ref target="tribunal-praetoris" n="U">TRIBUNAL PRAETORIS</ref>. According to
the third explanation the lacus was simply a spot of ground that had
been struck by lightning and then enclosed by a stone curb, or puteal,
by C. Curtius, consul in <date value="-445">445 B.C.</date> (Varro, <bibl>LL. v. 150</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the time of Augustus the lacus Curtius, <foreign xml:lang="la">siccas qui sustinet aras</foreign>,
was no longer a lacus but dry ground (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 403-4</bibl>), and into it a
small coin was thrown yearly by every Roman in fulfilment of his vows
for the emperor's safety (Suet. Aug. 7, 57). According to Kobbert
(RE i. A. 576) it is the character of the lacus Curtius as mundus which is
primary; but its connection with the underworld made it religiosus,
<pb n="311"/>
and the coins were probably offerings to the powers of the underworld
(WR 235).  Pliny (<bibl>NH xv. 78</bibl>) states that an altar that stood near the
lacus was removed at the time when Julius Caesar celebrated his last
games in the forum, but whether this altar was afterwards restored and
was one of the siccae arae of Ovid is unknown.</p>
<p>The existing remains of the lacus consist of two successive layers of
slabs of grey cappellaccio and brown Monte Verde tufa, both attributed
to the same (the Sullan) period by Van Deman and Frank, forming an
irregularly trapezoidal field about 10 metres long and nearly 9 in greatest
width, on which is a third layer of blocks of travertine surrounded with
a curb. Only part of this layer has been preserved. On its curb are
marks that indicate the existence of a screen or balustrade, on which the
relief mentioned above may have stood. On the western part of the lacus
are traces of rectangular bases which suggest the arae siccae of Ovid, and
near the eastern corner is the plinth of what was evidently a puteal,
or perhaps a round altar of cappellaccio, standing on a twelve-sided
base. The structure in its present shape is clearly a restoration of the
earlier lacus, carried out at the time of the Caesarian changes in the
forum. For description and discussion of the ruins and lacus in general,

<bibl>Dionys. vi. 13</bibl> ; LA 225, 226; Neue <bibl>Jahrb. 1902, 370-388</bibl>). Because of
this appearance the temple of <ref target="castor-aedes-templum" n="U">CASTOR AND POLLUX</ref> (q.v.) was built on the
<pb n="312"/>
west side of the spring. The same divinities were also said to have
appeared on the same spot after the victory of Pydna in <date value="-168">168 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Flor.
i. 28</bibl>. 15 ; Val. <bibl>Max. i. 8</bibl>. I). The spring, in the shape of a puteal, with
Castor and Pollux, is represented on coins of the gens Postumia, of about
<date value="-90">90 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Babelon ii. 379</bibl>, Nos. 5-6; BM. <bibl>Rep. ii. 310</bibl>, 718-723). The water
nymph Juturna belonged properly to the river Numicius, but was brought
to Rome, and became the tutelary deity of those '<foreign xml:lang="la"> qui artificium aqua
exercent</foreign>' (Serv. <bibl>Aen. xii. 139</bibl>), and her name was derived from '<foreign xml:lang="la">iuvare
quia laborantes iuvare consuevit</foreign>' (ib.; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 71</bibl>; Neue Jahrb.
cit. 383; cf. <ref target="iuturna-templum" n="U">IUTURNA TEMPLUM</ref>), or from Diuturna (the eternal) (Cic.
Pro Cluent. 101; Carcopino, Virgile et les Origines d'Ostie, 115, 480).
The water from her spring was regarded as especially wholesome (Frontin. de aq. 4).</p>
<p>This part of the forum was buried deep in rubbish (<bibl>LS ii. 202</bibl>) until
1900, when the 'precinct' of Juturna was entirely excavated (<bibl>NS 1900,
291-295</bibl>; <bibl>1901, 41-144</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1900, 67-74</bibl>, 285-295; <bibl>1903, 166-198</bibl>; <bibl>CR

<bibl>Suppl. iv. 476-9</bibl>). The ruins belong principally to the imperial period,
but there are some of earlier date. The lacus itself is a basin 2.12 metres
deep, the bottom of which measures 5.13 by 5.04 metres. In the middle
of this basin is a quadrilateral base 1.78 metres high and about 3 long
by 2 wide, which probably supported marble statues of the Dioscuri
with their horses, remains of which, broken into many fragments, were
found (they are probably South Italian works of the <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth century B.C.</dateRange>).
The basin is paved with marble slabs, beneath which is a considerable
extent of tufa pavement with a different orientation (that of the precinct
of Vesta) belonging to the earlier structure, and lying at about o1.90
metres above sea-level (<bibl>JRS 1922, 5</bibl>, 21). The lower walls of opus
reticulatum rise to the same height on three sides as the base just mentioned, which appears to have been the level of the precinct in republican
times. On this wall is a ledge about 1.50 metres wide, and round this a
later wall of opus incertum, 1.23 metres high, with travertine curbing
and indications of a metal balustrade. At the top the basin measures
about 10 metres square. The whole inner surface of the basin was lined
with marble, and at the north-east and north-west corner of its pavement
are the two springs by which it has always been fed. The east side of
the basin was entirely changed by being built over in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>,
in order, apparently, to provide quarters for the <ref target="statio-aquarum" n="U">STATIO AQUARUM</ref> (q.v.).
An altar with representations of the Dioscuri and Helen (as Selene)
with Jupiter at one end and Leda on the other, which was found in the
basin, is probably Hadrianic (SScR 233). About 4 metres south of the
lacus is an altar on which are sculptured a male and female figure (no
doubt Juturna taking leave of Turnus) in the style of the time of
Severus; a well with marble curb or puteal, on which is an inscription
<pb n="313"/>
that records a restoration and dedication by M. Barbatius Pollio,
probably the partisan of M. Antonius<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The archaism Iuturnai, which is also found on the puteal, has been thought by some
to point to the time of Claudius.
</note> (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 70</bibl>; <bibl>Klio 1902,
233-234</bibl>); and an aedicula, consisting of a cella and pronaos, with two
marble columns. A statue of the goddess undoubtedly stood in the
apse of the aedicula, and a fragment of the epistyle was found near
by, inscribed IVTVRNAI S (Klio, loc. cit.). The aedicula of Juturna
abuts against a room with an apse of good Hadrianic brickwork, which
lies in the axis of the Nova Via. In Christian times it became an
oratory of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 82</bibl>; <bibl>1905, 85</bibl>, 86;
HC 160-161). Cf. HFP 39, and add. to <ref target="minerva-templum" n="U">MINERVA, TEMPLUM</ref>.</p>
<p>Just east of the lacus, between it and the wall of the atrium Vestae,
a ramp ascended from the forum to the Nova via, and the intervening
space was occupied by several chambers of later construction, one of
which was built out over part of the lacus itself. In these rooms were
found fragments of inscriptions relating to the curatores aquarum and
the statio aquarum, or headquarters of the water department of Rome
(<bibl>NS 1900, 293</bibl>; <bibl>1901, 129-131</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1900, 72</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 72-73</bibl>; <bibl>Klio
1902, 235</bibl>; Thed. 311-312). One of these inscriptions, on the pedestal
of a statue dedicated to Constantine on Ist March, 328, records the
restoration of the statio at that time by the curator aquarum, Fl. Maesius
Egnatius Lollianus. It is therefore probable that the statio occupied
these rooms as offices in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>, but how much earlier is not
known. A statue of Aesculapius, another of Apollo (<dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth century B.C.</dateRange>)
and other sculptural remains, found in this precinct, lend some support
to a theory that in the second and third centuries there was some sort
of a sanatorium of Aesculapius established here (Neue Jahrb. cit., 384-
388); and in the early Middle Ages the springs were still used, as is
shown by the large number of jugs of the <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange> which have
been found.</p>

locate the fanum  Orbonae. It was restored by Augustus (Mon. <bibl>Anc.

was 27th June (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 791-792</bibl>; Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 99</bibl>). These
are the only references that belong indisputably to this temple, and they
indicate a site at the top of the Sacra via, that is, near the arch of Titus.</p>
<p>In describing the line of the original pomerium, Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>)
gives four points, magna Herculis ara, ara Consi, curiae veteres, sacellum
Larum, presumably the four corners of the quadrilateral. Again Ovid,
under date of the kalends of May (<bibl>Fast. v. 129</bibl>, 130), makes this the day of
dedication of an altar of the Lares Praestites : <foreign xml:lang="la">Praestitibus Maiae Laribus
videre kalendae / aram constitui signaque parva deum</foreign>. It was thought
that Ovid here and in the passage quoted above might have been referring
to the same shrine, and that May Ist was the festival day of the earlier
<pb n="315"/>
temple, while 27th June was that of Augustus' restoration, a fact that the
poet forgot to make plain; but the discovery of Fast. Ant. (which is a
calendar earlier than Caesar) makes this hypothesis impossible. It is also
possible that the sacellum Larum of Tacitus may be the aedes in summa
sacra via, and that for some unknown reason he preferred to mark the
pomerium line at this point rather than at the north-west corner. Further
complication is introduced into the problem by two marble bases with
dedicatory inscriptions-<bibl>CIL vi. 456</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Laribus publicis sacrum imp.
Caesar Augustus ex stipe quam populus ei contulit k. lanuar. Apsenti</foreign>;
<bibl>vi. 30954</bibl>: Laribus Aug. sacrum-the first found near the entrance into
the forum from the Farnese gardens about 1555, that is, a little north-west
of the arch of Titus, a point corresponding to summa sacra via; and the
second found in 1879 opposite SS. Cosma e Damiano. Whether either of
these bases belongs to the aedes, or to some of the monuments erected
throughout the city by Augustus (Suet. Aug. 57), has been much disputed.
If the first does belong to the aedes (Richter 161), it is some evidence for
the site of the temple; if not (Mommsen, RGDA 82; HJ 22), it has no
value either way. The second is of no topographical value.</p>
<p>The relationship of these two or three shrines has given rise to much
discussion, but the most probable, although not altogether satisfactory,
explanation is that the aedes restored by Augustus in summa sacra via
had no connection with the sacellum of Tacitus, which was at the north-
west corner of the Palatine and identical with the ara Larum Praestitum
of Ovid (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 420; HJ 22; Richter, Die alteste Wohnstatte des
rom. Volkes 9, 10; Top. 33, 160-161; WR 171; Wissowa, Ges. Abh.

and other literature cited in these references). It has also been conjectured
that the sacellum Larum formed part of the <ref target="atrium-vestae" n="U">ATRIUM VESTAE</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>During recent excavations some ruins were found on the south-west
side of the arch of Titus, which may have belonged to this temple, but
reconstructions have been so extensive at this point that any certainty
seems impossible (<bibl>CR  1905, 75-76</bibl>, 237, 328; <bibl>1909, 61</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1905,

makes it probable that the temple stood at the extreme northern point of
the Aventine, just above the porta Trigemina. It was struck by lightning
at the time of Cinna's death (App. <bibl>BC i. 78</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ th=s *selh/nhs...i(ero/v</foreign>);
after the destruction of Corinth Mummius dedicated some of the spoils

<date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> (Liv. xxvii. II) and rebuilt, but in <date value="-179">179 B.C.</date> M. Fulvius Nobilior
seems to have erected a new structure on the north-east side of the basilica
Aemilia (which was built by himself and his colleague in the censorship),
which absorbed the forum piscarium, the forum cuppedinis, and other
special markets that occupied this site (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 146-147</bibl> ; Fest. 238;
<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>). It probably consisted of a central building, which in Varro's
time was a tholos in shape, surrounded with shops (Liv. loc. cit.; Varro
ap. Non. 448; Altm. 73, 74). The name, like the Greek JadeXXov (Varro,
<bibl>LL. v. 146</bibl>), is thought to be Semitic in origin (Walde, s.v.), but was
variously explained by the Romans (Varro, loc. cit.; Fest. 125; Donat.
ad Ter. Eun. 256). The entrance to the market-house was called fauces
macelli (Cic. <bibl>Verr. iii. 145</bibl>; pro Quinct. 25), and a short street, the
Corneta (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 152</bibl>), led from it to the Sacra via. This market is
not mentioned after the beginning of the empire, and its business was
probably transferred to the other macella. In any case it must have
been removed to make room for the later imperial fora (Jord. i. I. 432-436).</p>

It is represented on coins of the period (Cohen, Nero 126-130; BM. Nero
191-197, 335-337) as a circular building of two stories, with a central
tholos or domed structure surrounded by colonnades. This is generally
thought to have been destroyed at some later date and rebuilt at the

has nothing to recommend it. Rivoira (RA 79-81) was unable to see anything above
ground that showed the remotest indication of work of the time of Nero.

It was transformed into the church of S. Stefano by Pope Simplicius
(468-482); and restored with various changes by Theodore I (642-649) and
Nicolas V <bibl>(1453)</bibl>. Of the building of Nero the only remaining portions
are the travertine foundations, part of the enclosure wall, and eight
pilasters of the outer colonnade, but the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> structure was
built on the original foundations and appears to have preserved in general
the form of the original. It consisted of a two-storied circular colonnade,
of twenty-two columns, which supported a domed roof. This was
surrounded by an outer concentric colonnade of thirty-six columns, also
two stories high. Outside of this was an ambulatory 10 metres wide,
divided into eight segments by rows of columns (<bibl>JRS 1919, 179</bibl>). The
alternate segments had no outer wall and therefore resembled open
courts. The original circular building of Nero was enclosed by a rectangular porticus,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The discovery of remains of the Castra Peregrina only 15 metres from the outer circle

represented the goddess (<bibl>Liv. xxix. 37</bibl>. 2; <bibl>xxxvi. 36</bibl>; de vir; <bibl>ill. 46</bibl>. 3;
Prudent. Mart. Rom. 206; Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. vii. 188</bibl>). It was dedicated on
11th April, <date value="-191">191 B.C.</date>, by the praetor M. Junius Brutus, on which occasion
the ludi Megalenses were instituted (Liv. loc. cit.; Fast. Praen. ap.
CIL i". p. 235, 314-315, cf. p. 251=vi. 32498; Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921,
91</bibl>) and celebrated in front of the temple (Cic. de har. resp. 24; cf. for site
Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 55</bibl>; <bibl>Mart. vii. 73</bibl>. 3). It was burned in <date value="-111">111 B.C.</date>, when the statue
of Quinta Cloelia within it was uninjured, restored by a Metellus, probably
the consul of <date value="-110">110 B.C.</date>, burned again and restored by Augustus in <date value="3">3 A.D.</date>
(Val. <bibl>Max. i. 8</bibl>. II; Obseq. 99; Ov. <bibl>Fast. iv. 347-348</bibl>; Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 8</bibl>),
and was standing unharmed in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not. Reg. X). It is
referred to incidentally under date of <date value="-38">38 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlviii. 43</bibl>. 4), by
Juvenal (ix. 23) as a place of assignation, and in the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange> (Hist.
Aug. Claud. 4; Aurel. I). The stone needle itself is described by a late
writer (Arnob. adv. gentes vii. 49) as small and set in a silver statue
of the goddess (cf. Herodianus ab exc. d. Marci i. II; <bibl>Arnob. v. 5</bibl>).
It was perhaps removed by Elagabalus to his temple (q.v.) on the
Palatine (Hist. Aug. Elag. 3; cf. LR 134-138; but cf. <bibl>BC 1883, 211</bibl>;
HJ 53-54, n. 44).</p>
<p>At the top of the Scalae Caci, on the west corner of the Palatine, are
the ruins of an ancient temple near which have been found inscriptions
relating to Magna Mater (<bibl>CIL vi. 496</bibl>, 1040, 3702= 30967; <bibl>NS 1896, 186</bibl>;
cf. <bibl>CIL xii. 405</bibl>), a portion of a colossal female figure seated on a throne,
and a fragment of a base with the paws of lions, the regular attendants
of the goddess. These ruins consist of a massive podium made of irregular
pieces of tufa and peperino laid in thick mortar, and fragments of columns
and entablature. The walls of the podium are 3.84 metres thick (those
of the cella were somewhat thinner) on the sides and 5.50 in the rear,
<pb n="325"/>
but this unusual thickness is due to the fact that the rear wall is double,
with an air space, 1.80 metre wide, between the two parts. This wall
was faced on the outside with stucco, not with opus quadratum. The
total length of the temple was 33.18 metres and its width 17.10. It
was prostyle hexastyle, of the Corinthian order, and was approached by
a flight of steps extending entirely across the front. From the rear wall
of the cella projects the base of a pedestal on which the stone needle
probably stood.  The concrete of the podium  belongs to the time of
Augustus (<bibl>AJA 1912, 393</bibl>), and since the remaining architectural fragments are of peperino, it is evident that the restoration of that period was
carried out with the material of the original structure.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> There is considerable divergence of opinion as to the date of the podium; TF 98
attributes it to <date value="-110">110 B.C.</date>, and believes that the architectural members were given a new
coat of stucco under Augustus. Fiechter (ap. Toeb. 5) assigns the whole to the middle
of the <dateRange from="-99" to="-1">first century B.C.</dateRange>; but it does not seem at all necessary to suppose that Augustus
would not have used peperino coated with stucco (cf. HJ 53; ASA 23; HFP 61, 62).
</note>The character
of these remains and the inscriptions and objects found here make it
extremely probable, to say the least, that this is the temple of Magna
Mater, an identification that is strongly supported by the evidence of a
coin of the elder Faustina (Cohen, Faust. sen. 55). This represents a
temple of the Corinthian order, with curved roof, and a flight of steps
on which is a statue of Cybele with a turreted crown enthroned between
lions. The temple is also represented in a relief in the Villa Medici,
formerly attributed to the Ara Pacis (SScR  69).  (For the complete
description of the ruins and argument for identification, see <bibl>Mitt. 1895,
1-28</bibl>; <bibl>1906, 277</bibl>; for the coins, ib. 1908, 368-374; in general, HJ 51-4;

erected at the four cross-roads near the meta sudans-perhaps on or
near the site of the arch of Constantine. He does not even quote the

<p> the ancient altar, which was the earliest cult centre of Mars
in the campus Martius, mentioned first in what purports to be a citation

ara in campo solitaurilia utra voluerit caedito &lt;qui cepit ei aeris cc
dato&gt;?</foreign>). Its erection belonged undoubtedly to the early regal period.
In <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> a porticus was built from the <ref target="porta-fontinalis" n="U">PORTA FONTINALIS</ref> (q.v.) to this
altar (<bibl>Liv. xxxv. 10</bibl>. 12:<foreign xml:lang="la"> alteram (porticum) a porta Fontinali ad Martis

in campo ad aram Martis sellis curulibus consederunt</foreign>). These are the only
passages in which the ara is expressly mentioned, and indicate a site not
too far from the porta Fontinalis-probably on the north-east side of the
Capitoline hill-to be reached by a porticus of that early date, and
relatively near the place of holding the comitia (OVILE, q.v.).</p>
<p>Two other passages mention a templum or <foreign xml:lang="greek">nao/s</foreign> of Mars in the campus
Martius (not that in circo Flaminio, see above), one referring to an
occurrence of <date value="9">9 A.D.</date> (Cass. Dio Ivi. 24. 3: 8 <foreign xml:lang="greek">o(/ te ga\r tou= )/*arews nao\s o( e)n tw=| pedi/w| au)tou= w)/n e)kepaupwnh/qh</foreign>), and the other a little later (Consol. ad Liv.

ii. 859-60</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> ex vero positum permansit Equiria nomen / qua deus in campo

from a shrine.  Whether Livy's statement (vi. 5. 8: <foreign xml:lang="la">eo anno (<date value="-388">388 B.C.</date>)
aedes Martis Gallico bello vota dedicata est</foreign>) refers to such a temple or
to the temple of Mars outside the porta Capena is uncertain.</p>
<p>There are two views as to the relation and site of altar and temple-
one that the original ara was situated just east of the site of the existing
Pantheon, in the Via del Seminario, and that a shrine was afterwards
built close to it, making one cult centre; the other that the ara was near
the present Piazza del Gesu, and the temple much further north, perhaps
halfway between Montecitorio and the Piazza Borghese. (For an elaboration of these views, see <bibl>CP 1908, 65-74</bibl>; and for the subject in general,
HJ 475-477; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 2389-2390</bibl>; WR 142-146; <bibl>Gilb. i. 289-290</bibl>; <bibl>iii.

<p>Anti maintains that the well-known frieze in Paris and Munich
(Ant. <bibl>Denk. iii. 12</bibl>; SScR 10-14), generally supposed to have been set
up by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus near the circus Flaminius, really belongs
to a monument dedicated at this altar by a censor who had special reasons
for devotion to Neptune-therefore, probably, P. Servilius Isauricus,

of the temples of Mater Matuta and Fortuna (<bibl>Liv. xxxiii. 27</bibl>. 4), and if,
as is probable, these arches were part of a colonnade surrounding them
both, the temples must have been near together and perhaps had the
same orientation. In the temple of Matuta Ti. Sempronius Gracchus
placed a bronze tablet<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Urlichs, Malerei vor Caesar, interprets 'tabula' as 'picture,' and probably rightly.
There is no word of its being of bronze. For a similar inscription (the painting is not
mentioned) in the temple of the Lares Permarini see <bibl>Liv. xl. 52</bibl>. 4.
</note> (<bibl>Liv. xli. 28</bibl>. 8), on which was a record of his

was that of the Matralia,  Ith June (Fasti Tusc. Ven. Maff. ad iii id. Iun.,

<ref target="fortuna" n="U">FORTUNA</ref> (q.v.)).</p>
<p>On the north side of the modern Piazza della Bocca della Verita, a
site corresponding to that indicated by the evidence of literature, is an
ancient temple converted into the church of S. Maria Egiziaca in 872
(Arm. 612). The temple is Ionic (111. 31), 20 metres long and 12 wide,
with north-south orientation parallel to the Tiber, tetrastyle prostyle, and
stands on a podium 2.50 metres in height and originally 26 metres long.
<pb n="331"/>
It was pseudo-peripteral, with five engaged columns in the side walls of
the cella and a pronaos. The two free columns of the pronaos were
walled up to increase the size of the church ; but the temple has recently
been isolated and all modern accretions have been removed. The cella
walls and engaged columns, except those at the angles, are of tufa; the
columns of the pronaos, the capitals of all the columns, the architrave
and cornice, and the facing of the podium, of travertine. The frieze
was decorated with ox-skulls and garlands, but most of this decoration
has disappeared.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For a theory, for which there is no evidence, that this stucco decoration belongs to the
Renaissance period, see Gnomon i. <bibl>(1925)</bibl>, 367.
</note> The temple faced toward the street leading up from
the pons Aemilius, and not toward the forum Boarium proper. This
has sometimes been identified with the temple of Fortuna, but it is more
probable that it is that of Mater Matuta. If this is correct, the temple
must have been restored about the <date value="-50">middle of the first century B.C.</date>, to
which period the construction seems to point. For this identification,

Spada d'Orlando, between the Via dei Pastini and the Piazza Capranica,
five columns of cipollino have been found-one still visible and two built
into a wall-which may perhaps have belonged to this temple. They
are 1.70 metres in diameter, and the indications point to an octostyle
structure, about 36 metres wide, that faced north on what is now the
Piazza Capranica (cf. Lanciani FUR, pl. 15, for a different orientation).

tholus (see <ref target="mica-aurea" n="U">MICA AUREA</ref>). It was thus the first building which he erected
in the Campus Martius, and characterises his conception of the principate
(HJ 497).</p>
<p>From these passages and from the existing remains we may gather
that it consisted of a large circular drum, faced with travertine, or, as
some think, marble; this was 87 metres in external diameter at the base.
Above it rose an upper arcade, traces of which may be seen in all the
<dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> views, and there were probably other tiers above,
planted with evergreen trees, while at the summit was a bronze statue of
Augustus. The entrance was on the south, with a small chamber over
it, lighted by a window; and the passage way, 3.5 metres wide, led
through a double ring of (originally) closed chambers to a wall in which
there were two doorways, one on each side of the mass of concrete in front
of the passage way. This wall runs right up, and its inner face is visible
in the corridor surrounding the present concert hall: and it formed the
enclosing wall of the Renaissance garden (see below). Within it, at a
lower level, were two, or perhaps three, concentric corridors: but the
vaults in this area have collapsed, and the whole has been used as a
lime kiln in the Middle Ages; so that the urns and inscriptions which
have been found here were not in situ. In the centre is a square space,
probably originally filled with masonry as a support for the statue of
Augustus.</p>
<p>Between the outermost concentric wall and the next is a series of twelve
large chambers, which were probably entirely inaccessible in ancient times.
The outermost wall preserved to any considerable height has twelve semi-
circular niches, not intended for decoration, but as supports for the
external skin wall of travertine. In the centre of each niche is a chord
wall, probably intended to break up the mass of earth with which the niche
was filled, and prevent its swelling and causing collapse. There is no trace
of a square foundation, and the mausoleum probably resembled one of the
<pb n="333"/>
sepulchral mound tombs of Caere, in Southern Etruria; though it must
have risen in several tiers, and the mound of earth at the top must therefore have been comparatively small. On pillars <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1904, 57</bibl>; Kornemann, Mausoleum und Tatenbericht des Augustus, 16.
</note> standing free, rather than
on the outer wall of the mausoleum, on each side of the entrance, were
fastened the two bronze tablets on which were inscribed the Res
Gestae Divi Augusti (often known as the Monumentum  Ancyranum,
because the most complete copy of it is preserved on the walls of the
temple of Augustus at Ancyra, the modern Angora).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Another copy of it has been found at Antioch in Pisidia, and has been published by
Ramsay and v. Premerstein in Klio, Beiheft 19.
</note>  Gardthausen's
idea (Mitt. 1921-22, 11r-144) that these tablets were placed upon the
external buttresses of the mausoleum itself is most infelicitous ; and his
article, while containing valuable information, is in most details misleading. Thus, the unit of measurement used in P. A. Bufalini's plan
is not the span (=25 cm.), but the palm (=223 mm.). In front of the
entrance stood two obelisks (see OBELISCI MAUSOLEI AUGUSTI); and the
mausoleum was surrounded by a spacious park planted with trees and laid
out with walks.</p>
<p>The first individual whose ashes were placed in the mausoleum was
Augustus' heir designate Marcellus, who died in <date value="-23">23 B.C.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio liii.

B.C. (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 2</bibl>. 3: Consol. cit.: Suet. Claud. I; cf. TUMULUS
IULIAE). The remains of the two grandsons of Augustus, who had also
been designated as his heirs, Lucius (<date value="2">2 A.D.</date>) and Gaius (<date value="4">4 A.D.</date>), were
also placed here (Fasti Cupr. cit. is decisive for the latter; for the urn
which once contained either his ashes or, more probably, those of his
brother, see <bibl>CIL vi. 884</bibl>, and HJ 615, n. 37. Whether the fragment
of an elogium of Lucius (<bibl>CIL vi. 895</bibl> =31r 95) belonged to the mausoleum
is not certain), though perhaps in a separate monument, or perhaps only
in a separate chamber (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxviii. 24</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">to/ te sw=ma au)th=s</foreign>(Julia

<p>In <date value="14">14 A.D.</date> Augustus' own ashes were placed here (Cass. Dio Ivi. 42;
Tac. <bibl>Ann. i. 8</bibl>). He had in his will excluded his daughter Julia and her
daughter from burial in his mausoleum (Suet. Aug. 110; Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi.
32</bibl>). Hirschfeld seems to lay too much stress on the statement in the
Mirabilia (§ 22, ap. <bibl>Jord. ii. 629</bibl>) that there was an apse in the centre
of the mausoleum, in which there had been a seated statue of Augustus.
Next followed (soon after 19) Germanicus (Tac. <bibl>Ann. iii. 4</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">reliquiae
<pb n="334"/>
tumulo Augusto inferebantur</foreign>; two fragments of an elogium  of him
carved on blocks,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> HJ 616, n. 39, calls them blocks of marble, and the testimony of Peruzzi supports him
(CIL vi. p. 840); but they cannot have belonged to the base, if Peruzzi is right in saying
that it was of travertine (<bibl>BC 1882, 154</bibl>).
</note> belonging to the facing of the base, are given in <bibl>CIL
vi. 894</bibl>=31 94).  For his children, see <ref target="ustrinum-domus-augustae" n="U">USTRINUM  DOMUS AUGUSTAE</ref>.
Livia's ashes were placed here in <date value="29">29 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lviii. 2</bibl>. 3) and eight
years later those of Tiberius (our classical authorities do not expressly
mention it, but they would undoubtedly have emphasised his exclusion;
and <bibl>CIL vi. 885</bibl>, the inscription on his funeral urn, which was still
preserved in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>, agrees absolutely in content with
the rest of those from the mausoleum). His successor Caligula, whose
mother Agrippina and brothers Nero and Drusus had died-the first
two in exile, the last in the cellars of the Palatine-collected their
remains and placed them  here (Cass. <bibl>Dio lix. 3</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">ta\ o)sta= ta/ te th=s mhtro\s kai\ ta\ tw=n a)delfw=n tw=n a)poqano/ntwn</foreign>; Suet. Tib. 54: <foreign xml:lang="la">amborum
sic reliquias dispersas ut vix quandoque colligi possent</foreign>). The block of
marble which bears the inscription in honour of Agrippina, and once
contained an urn of more precious material in which her cremated remains
(ossa) were placed, is still preserved in the Palazzo dei Conservatori
(<bibl>CIL vi. 886</bibl>), while a block with the inscription of the elder Nero only
disappeared after the sixteenth century (ib. 887).  The mention of both
brothers in the passages quoted above would certainly  lead one to
believe that the younger Drusus' remains were similarly treated.</p>
<p>Hirschfeld thinks that Caligula's sister Drusilla was also placed here, but
there is no direct evidence-no more than there is in the case of Claudius,
Britannicus, and Vespasian. The door of the mausoleum suddenly sprang
open shortly before the death of the last-named (Suet. Vesp. 23; Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxvi. 17</bibl>), but he declared that the portent did not concern him. See
also <ref target="gens-flavia-templum" n="U">GENS FLAVIA, TEMPLUM</ref>. The fragmentary inscription <ref target="gens-flavia-templum" n="U">VESPASIANI</ref>
(<bibl>CIL vi. 893</bibl>) cannot refer to the emperor, and may belong to the son of
Flavius Clemens (<bibl>Pros. ii. 77</bibl>. 262). Tacitus' reference to Nero's second
wife Poppaea Sabina, <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus . .. tumulo Iuliorum infertur </foreign>(<bibl>Ann. xvi. 6</bibl>),
is generally connected with the mausoleum, and can hardly belong to the
<ref target="tumulus-iuliae" n="U">TUMULUS IULIAE</ref> (q.v.).  Nerva, on the other hand, was certainly
buried here (Epit. de Caes. 12. 12:<foreign xml:lang="la"> cuius corpus a senatu, ut quondam
Augusti, honore delatum, in sepulcro Augusti sepultum est</foreign>), and it is
even possible that the author of the Mirabilia (cit. supr.) actually saw his
sepulchral inscription, as Hirschfeld believes, or at least the inscription
on the base of his statue, which has recently come to light (<bibl>BC 1926, 222</bibl>).</p>
<p>Trajan's ashes, as is well known, were placed in the chamber at the
foot of his column; while Hadrian, we are expressly told <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)ta/fh ... pro\s th=| gefu/ra| th=| *ai)li/a|. e)ntau+qa ga\r to\ mnh=ma kareskeu/asato.

It had indeed, as we know from an inscription of a freedman of Trajan,
<pb n="335"/>
for some years been under the charge of an imperial procurator (<bibl>CIL vi.
8686</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">M. Ulpius Aug. 1. Aeglus proc. mausolaei imaginem Corintheam
Traiani Caesaris colleg(io) faenariorum d(ono) d(edit)</foreign>). It was only
opened on one other occasion-when the body of Julia Domna was
temporarily placed there (see above).</p>
<p>The obelisks are mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, and in the
Breviarium of Not. and Cur.; but it is surprising that the mausoleum
as a whole is not enumerated in the text among the monuments of
<rs key="regio9" type="region">Regio IX</rs>. The story of its plundering by Alaric in 410 has no historical
foundation, and we know nothing of its destruction. During the whole
of the Middle Ages it kept its name-Mons Augustus in 955-962 (<bibl>ASRSP
1899, 269</bibl>); while the churches of S. Angelus de Augusta, S. Georgius
de Augusta, S. Iacobus de Augusta and S. Marina de Posterula prope
montem  Augustum are mentioned in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> (Arm. 324 f.;
HCh 195, 254, 265, 315, 380-381) and the portus Aguste or Austu in the
thirteenth, from which marble was shipped for the construction of the
Cathedral of Orvieto (<bibl>BC 1897, 295</bibl>). The ruins were converted into a
fortress by the Colonna family, and its destruction in 167 led to considerable damage to the ruins. The fortifications were, however, repaired
in 1241. The body of Cola di Rienzo was burnt here in <date value="1354">1354</date>.</p>
<p>By the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> it had become a garden; it then belonged
to the Soderini family. (The important drawings by Baldassare Peruzzi,

may still be seen.</p>

Augustus had last been opened to receive the remains of Nerva, but
was no longer in use; and the Antonine emperors and their families
were buried also in the mausoleum of Hadrian,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Bernhart (Handbuch zur Muinzknnde, 140) believes that the Mausoleum is represented on the reverses of a number of coins of these emperors, all of which bear the word
CONSECRATIO: but it is almost certain that they simply show the funeral pyre (Boll. Ass.

name of Antoninorum  sepulcrum  or <foreign xml:lang="greek">)*antwninei=on</foreign> (Hist. Aug. and Cass.

follows: the dedicatory inscription to Hadrian and Sabina set up in
<date value="139">139 A.D.</date> (the latter was already deified, the former not) by Antoninus
Pius, the sepulchral inscriptions of Antoninus Pius and Faustina, and
of three of their children ; of Aelius Caesar; of three children of Marcus
Aurelius; of Lucius Verus, and of Commodus. That Marcus Aurelius
himself was buried here follows from Herodian 4. I. 4 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">a)pe/qento</foreign>-the urn
containing the ashes of Septimius Severus--<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n tw=| new=| e)/nqa *ma/rkou te kai\ tw=n pro\ au)tou= basile/wn I(era\ mnh/mata dei/knutai</foreign>), and it is probably true
of Faustina the younger also. Cass. Dio (lxxvi. 15. 4; <bibl>lxxviii. 9</bibl>. I;
24. 3) tells us that, besides Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta were
also laid to rest here. The various mentions of it in Hist. Aug. (Severus
19. 3=24. 2; Carac. 9. 12=Macrin. 5. 2) are simply copied from
Cassius Dio; see v. Domaszewski, <bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl> A. 5 sqq.; and, for
the first passage, cf. <ref target="sep-severi" n="U">SEPULCRUM SEVERI</ref>.</p>
<p>It had already been included in the system of fortifications by the
time of Procopius, when it was converted into a bridgehead (in Hadrianio
sunt turres vi. etc. DMH) and became the chief fortress of the city (see
<ref target="porta-aurelia-2" n="U">PORTA AURELIA (2)</ref>, <ref target="porta-aurelia-2" n="U">PORTA CORNELIA</ref>).  A description of it by Pope
Leo I (440-461) was long thought to have been preserved in the Mirabilia
(Urlichs 106); but the idea is baseless (<bibl>Jord. ii. 426</bibl> sqq.); and the account
of Petrus Mallius, which is often quoted as an independent authority, is
probably copied from the Mirabilia itself.</p>
<p>A detailed account is, however, given by Procopius (<bibl>BG i. 22</bibl>) who
says that it was faced with blocks of Parian marble, and that there were
statues of men and horses of the same material in the upper part, which
rose above the city walls. The statues were, many of them, hurled down
upon the besieging Goths in <date value="537">537 A.D.</date></p>
<p>John of Antioch (Malalas) cited in HJ 665, n. 113, writing in the
<dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange>, describes a colossal quadriga on the summit of the
mausoleum; but Hulsen points out (Boll. Ass. Arch. <bibl>Rom. iii. 27</bibl>) that

<pb n="337"/>
the chapel of S. Angelo de Castro S. Angeli, also called inter nubes-see
HCh p. 196, 586-which commemorated the vision of Gregory the
Great in 590, during a plague, of the archangel Michael sheathing his sword
above the fortress, and was probably founded by Pope Boniface IV
(608-615), must already have been in existence there. Another mediaeval
church was that of S. Thomas de Castro S. Angeli (HCh 491) ; while the
church constructed by Hadrian I (<foreign xml:lang="la">constituit ... foris portam b. Petri
apostoli... (diaconiam) S. Mariae quae ponitur in Adrianum</foreign>  (<bibl>LPD
i. 521</bibl>)) was later called S. Maria in Traspadina (which then became
Transpontina) and was only removed by Pius IV (HCh 370-371).</p>
<p>The description of the Mirabilia mentions the bronze railings which
surrounded the building <bibl>(the foundations of which came to light in
1890)</bibl>, and states that they were adorned with peacocks of gilt bronze,
afterwards removed to the fountain (the famous pinecone) which adorned
the forecourt of S. Peter's (Huilsen, <bibl>Mitt. 1904, 87</bibl> sqq.; Egger, Rom.
Veduten i. pls. 24, 25; text p. 28; DuP 35-40); also a porphyry sarcophagus (supposed, but without reason, to be that of Hadrian) which
served as the tomb of Pope Innocent II at the Lateran, while its cover
was in the forecourt of S. Peter's, over the tomb of Cynthius, prefect of
the city <bibl>(d. 1077)</bibl>. A bronze bull and four horses of gilt bronze, and
bronze doors on each side are also mentioned (Jordan treats them as
pure inventions, but it must be remembered that he wrote before the
discovery of the foundations of the railings), and bronze doors below
(i.e. in the square base of the tomb), ' as they appear at the present day.'
These last are also mentioned in connection with the death of Paschal II
in 1118 (<bibl>LPD ii. 344</bibl>,<foreign xml:lang="la"> obiit aput castellum S. Angeli, in domo iusta (sic)
eream portam</foreign>). As fortress, prison, and summer residence of the Popes
it has a most interesting history, which cannot be followed here. For
removal of ancient materials in the Middle Ages, see <bibl>LS i. 18</bibl>, 19; DAP
2. xv. 371.</p>
<p>The whole monument was enclosed by a low wall; at the entrance from
the bridge were four travertine pillars upon which stood the bronze
peacocks above mentioned; and between them  were bronze grilles
(<bibl>NS 1892, 424</bibl>). For the bronze bull which is said to have stood here
in the Middle Ages, see <bibl>JRS 1919, 21</bibl>; <bibl>1925, 77</bibl>. The lower part was a
base or podium about 84 metres square and  o0 high, consisting of a
travertine wall, faced originally with marble. Over the entrance was the
dedicatory inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 984</bibl>), the other sepulchral inscriptions
being disposed on each side of the door (<bibl>Mitt. 1891, 142</bibl>). Behind the
travertine wall is an inner wall of brickwork 2 feet thick, into which
are bonded the radiating brick walls of the vaulted chambers that
surrounded the main circular drum. At each angle the internal wall
thickens out into a solid mass to support the groups of men and horses
of which Procopius speaks.
Careful study of the points of contact between these walls </p>
<p>and the
<pb n="338"/>
main drum seems to indicate that the erection of the square base was
decided on after the building of the drum was well advanced, probably
for greater accommodation ; for though the chambers formed by the
radiating walls do not, in their present form, look very like sepulchral
chambers, it is difficult to seek elsewhere those which would probably
have been necessary-unless we suppose (which is not impossible, as
most, if not all, of the bodies were cremated) that the remains were placed
in the central tomb chamber. This measures about 9 by 8 metres, and
thus would have provided ample room for the urns-not more than twenty
in all, so far as we know-which were placed in the mausoleum.</p>
<p>The main drum, 64 metres in diameter and 21 high, is constructed
of concrete, and was also faced with Parian marble. The original
entrance, the floor of which is some 12 feet below the present level, has
been cleared; it leads into a vestibule, at the end of which is a large niche;
it probably contained a colossal statue of Hadrian, the head of which,
formerly in the Castello, is now in the Vatican (HF 292). A colossal
head of Antoninus Pius, which is still in the Castello, belongs also to a
statue (Bernoulli, Rom. <bibl>Ikon. ii. 2</bibl>. p. 143, No. 34). From the vestibule
a finely preserved spiral ramp, ventilated by four airshafts, at a gradient
of about 1 in 10, leads, through the solid core, up to the corridor of the
central tomb chamber, which lies vertically above it. The ramp was
probably continued as a staircase beyond the approach to the central
tomb-chamber, up to the level of the garden (the earth belonging to it was
found in Borgatti's excavations, and under it was a bed of concrete),
which appears to have occupied the upper surface of the drum, except
for a second square chamber. Above this again was a cylinder containing
a third (circular) chamber; the spiral staircase which encircles this
chamber and by which the uppermost terrace is now approached has
recently been shown to be ancient to within 8 feet of the top.</p>

probably to be supplied in the list of Domitian's buildings. If these all
refer to the same mica aurea, it was clearly a building. In Martial's
epigram  (ii. 59) :<foreign xml:lang="la"> Mica vocor: quid sim cernis, cenatio parva; / ex me
Caesareum prospicis ecce tholum. / frange toros, pete vina, rosas cape,

some kind of small pleasure-house or dining-hall, which might naturally
be identified with the mica aurea of Domitian.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This is rather doubtful; for the epigram would seem to have been composed in order
to be actually inscribed on a tablet and set up on the building, which would then have been
a private and not an imperial edifice.

be anything else than the mausoleum of Augustus in the northern part
of the campus Martius, a building that could hardly be seen at all from
such a cenatio on the Caelian, where the mica aurea of Not. was situated.
Either Martial's mica was not the mica aurea of the chroniclers, or the
tholos must refer to some other sepulchral monument that we cannot
identify (HJ 252 ; <bibl>Jord. ii. 32</bibl>, 35; Friedlander ad <bibl>Mart. ii. 59</bibl>; Pr. Reg.

(Jord. i. I. 69, 71 ; ii. xv.; Arm. 664-666; HCh 240) and S. Iohannes
in mica aurea (<bibl>Jord. ii. 343</bibl> ; Arm. 691 ; <bibl>Mel. 1914, 352-356</bibl>; HCh 273).
It is probable that a mica aurea, something like that of Domitian (v. supra)
had been built on the slope of the Janiculum between S. Cosimato and
S. Pietro in Montorio, which gave its name to the immediate district
and perhaps later simply to a street (Mon. <bibl>L. i. 482</bibl>; HJ 650; <bibl>RL 1909,
151</bibl>). A <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> inscription, containing the word micaurea, may
be the earliest reference to this locality, but this is very uncertain (<bibl>BC 1889, 392-397</bibl>, where Gatti explains mica aurea as referring to the yellow
sand on the lower slope of the hill, comparing mons aureus=Montorio;
<bibl>Mitt. 1891, 148</bibl>). Another reference is to be found on a fresco in the
lower church of S. Crisogono, with the figure of one Romanus P.P. de
Mica Aurea (a good deal previous to the <dateRange from="900" to="999">tenth century</dateRange>) (BA 1914, Cr

<p> a column covered with gilt bronze, erected by
Augustus in <date value="-20">20 B.C.</date>, when he assumed the cura viarum  about Rome
(Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 8</bibl>). It was regarded as the point of convergence of all the
great roads running out of the city (Plut. Galba 24), and on it were
engraved the names of the principal cities of the empire and their distances
from Rome, although these distances were reckoned from the gates in the
Servian wall, not from the milliarium itself (Plin. <bibl>NH iii. 66</bibl>). This
stood <foreign xml:lang="la">in capite romani fori</foreign> (Plin. loc. cit.) and <foreign xml:lang="la">sub aede Saturni</foreign> (Tac. <bibl>Hist.

<p> a temple on the Aventine, first mentioned as becoming
the headquarters of the scribae and histriones during the second Punic
war (Fest. 333). It was restored by Augustus (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 6</bibl>=<bibl>Greek
x. 10</bibl>, 11,<foreign xml:lang="greek">nao\s )*aqhna=s</foreign>; cf. RGDA 81; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 664</bibl>; Merlin 300-301), was
standing in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not. Reg. XIII), and is represented on the
Marble Plan (fr. 2) as peripteral hexastyle, about 22 metres wide and 45
long, with thirteen columns on each side. It seems to have been between
the temples of <ref target="luna-aedes" n="U">LUNA</ref> and <ref target="luna-aedes" n="U">DIANA</ref> (q.v.; <bibl>Oros. v. 12</bibl>), probably near the
intersection of the modern Vie di S. Sabina and S. Prisca (Merlin 103).</p>
<p>The date of the foundation of this temple is not known. The day of
dedication is given in some of the sources as the Quinquatrus, 19th
March (Ov. <bibl>Fast. iii. 812</bibl>; Fest. 257; Fast. Praen. ad xiii Kal. Apr.,
CIL ia. p. 234; cf. Fast. Philoc. ib. 260, where the date is erroneously
21st March); in others as 19th June (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 728</bibl>; Fast. Esq. Amit.
ad xiii Kal. Iul., CIL i². p. 211. 243; Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 99</bibl>). This
discrepancy has been explained by supposing that the later date was that
of the restored temple (Aust. de aed. sacr. 42 f.; WR 253; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 2985</bibl>),
or that it referred to the constitutio of the temple, and the earlier to the
dedicatio (CIL i'. p. 312-313, 320; HJ 159).</p>

</note> it is stated that the originals were placed <foreign xml:lang="la">in muro post
templum divi Aug. ad Minervam</foreign>, and the same juxtaposition of these
two temples is found in Martial (iv. 53. 1-2:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Hunc, quem saepe vides
intra penetralia nostrae / Palladis et templi limina, Cosme, novi</foreign>). The
shrine of Minerva should, then, be situated between the temple of Augustus
and the temple of Castor, and many scholars have accepted Hulsen's
theory which identifies it with the large court (19 by 21 metres) which
served later as the forecourt of S. Maria Antiqua, behind, i.e. east, of the
temple of Augustus and in front of the building supposed to be the
bibliotheca divi Augusti, or else with a smaller shrine standing in this
court (HJ 83-84; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 79-80</bibl>; HC 172-175 ; Th6d. 310; Tea in
<bibl>BA 1921, 356</bibl> sqq.; ZA 92-94; see also <bibl>Gilb. iii. 45</bibl> ; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 2990</bibl>).
Another explanation is that Domitian, after restoring the temple of
Castor, rededicated it under the name of Castorum et Minervae (Mommsen, Chron. 354, P. 652). (For further particulars and the description
of the ruins, see <ref target="augustus-divus-templum" n="U">TEMPLUM D. AUGUSTI</ref>.)</p>
<p>A more recent theory (Richmond in Essays and Studies presented to
William Ridgeway on his Sixtieth Birthday, <bibl>Cambridge 1913, 206-211</bibl>)
is that the templum Minervae (Chronog. Cur. Mart. locc. citt. and <bibl>CIL
x. 6441</bibl>)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. however, supra, p. 165, where this inscription is correctly interpreted. Richmond's
whole theory depends on his refusal to identify the <ref target="horrea-agrippiana" n="U">HORREA AGRIPPIANA</ref> (q.v.) with the
first of the three courtyards (see his plan, p. 212).
</note> was a library erected by Domitian in honour of Minerva and
really her chief temple in Rome, and that this structure comprised the
complex of buildings of the time of Domitian, commonly called the
<foreign xml:lang="la">templum d. Augusti and bibliotheca templi d. Augusti</foreign>. The Minerva
of the diplomas (v. supra) is the name given to part of the earlier library
belonging to the temple of Augustus-although separated from it by a
wall, which was built by Tiberius and lay south of the existing church
of S. Teodoro. Still more recently Bartoli (<bibl>BC 1924, 250-259</bibl>) has
maintained that the phrase ad Minervam refers to a statue, not to a
temple at all; Chron. and Cur. cit. would then refer to the temple of
Minerva in the forum Nervae (YW  1925-6, 113). The juxtaposition of
the temple with that of Castor and Pollux is, however, strongly against
this view.</p>

Minervium  qua in Caelio monte itur in tabernola</foreign>), where Minervium
undoubtedly is this shrine, which is therefore to be located on the northern
part of the Caelius, the Caeliolus, probably very near the present church
of the SS. Quattro Coronati (<bibl>Gilb. ii. 33-34</bibl>). This also corresponds with
a possible indication of the Haterii relief, where a statue of Minerva is
seen through the arcus ad Isis (Mon. d. <bibl>Inst. v. 7</bibl> ; Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1849, 377</bibl>).
If this is accepted as evidence, it shows that the shrine was standing in
the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>. An inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 524</bibl>) found on the Caelian
may also refer to it, and a statue of Minerva in alabaster found near
SS. Quattro Coronati, now in the Museo delle Terme, is attributed to it
(<bibl>NS 1926, 61</bibl>).</p>
<p>Ovid gives four explanations (<bibl>Fast. iii. 839-848</bibl>) of the epithet Capta,
of which only one has any probability (843-844: <foreign xml:lang="la">an quia perdomitis ad
nos captiva Faliscis I venit ? et hoc ipsum littera prisca docet</foreign>). If this
be true, the shrine was erected after the destruction of Falerii in <date value="-241">241 B.C.</date>
The terms parva delubra and Minervium  should indicate that this
shrine was not an aedes sacra but only a sacellum. If so, Ovid's statement
(see above) that the day of dedication was 19th March is an error, due
to the confusion of this sacellum-which would have no natale marked
on the calendar-with the temple of Minerva on the Aventine (HJ
226-227; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 2984-2985</bibl>; WR 253; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 233-235</bibl>, and other

it was a restoration of the temple built by Pompeius (Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 97</bibl>)

<p> a tomb discovered in 1919 on the right of
the via Labicana, close to the horti Torquatiani, on the south-east of
the modern Viale Manzoni. It is almost certainly to be attributed to the
period of the Severi. The name is given by an inscription in mosaic
in the floor. The paintings of the subterranean interior, which are of
great interest, have been variously interpreted; the latest authority,
Wilpert (Mem. <bibl>AP i. 2</bibl>. 1-43) interprets them as Gnostic, but eclectic.
The Sermon on the Mount is clear; but this, like the other scenes, e.g.
the clothing of the naked and the feeding of the hungry, might deceive
a pagan visitor into supposing that there was nothing Christian about
the tomb. In the series of the Apostles a portrait of S. Peter (the
earliest we have) and in the upper chamber representations of Adam and
Eve may be clearly recognised.</p>

<placeName>MUNDUS</placeName>
</head>
<p> *  According to our ancient authorites, there was a holy place in
Rome, called mundus, or probably mundus Cereris (Fest. 142: <foreign xml:lang="la">Cereris
qui mundus appellatur, qui ter in anno solet patere; viiII Kal. Sept.</foreign>
<pb n="347"/>
(explained as postridie Volkanalia, ib. 156) <foreign xml:lang="la">et III Non. Octobr. et vi
Id. Novembr. Qui vel enim <note anchored="true" place="foot"> So Lindsay; Miller has ' omni...' No satisfactory emendation has yet been proposed.
</note> dictus est quod terra movetur</foreign>), which was
in connection with the worship of the gods of the underworld. It was a
domed structure, large enough for a man to enter (ib. 157: <foreign xml:lang="la">qui . . . quid
ita dicatur sic refert Cato in commentaris iuris civilis: ' Mundo nomen
impositum est ab eo mundo, qui supra nos est: forma enim eius est, ut
ex is qui intravere cognoscere potui, adsimilis illae </foreign>') and in the floor of it
there was an opening, leading to a chamber or shaft, which was sacred
to the Di Manes, and was only opened on the three days above mentioned,
which were regarded as unlucky. Varro (ap. <bibl>Macrob. i. 16</bibl>. 18) also
says ' <foreign xml:lang="la">mundus cum patet, deorum  tristium atque inferum quasi ianua
patet</foreign>'; cf. Serv. ad Verg. <bibl>Aen. iii. 134</bibl>: ' <foreign xml:lang="la">quidam aras superorum
deorum voluit esse, medioximorum, id est marinorum focos, inferorum
vero mundos.</foreign>' That the stone which closed the opening was called
Manalis lapis is a pure conjecture (see <ref target="manalis-lapis" n="U">MANALIS LAPIS (1)</ref>). Nor have
we any information whatsoever as to the site of the mundus.</p>
<p>On the Palatine there was a small shrine (generally, since the time of
K. O. Miller, Etrusker, ii. 99, identified with the mundus, but without
sufficient grounds), which was a memorial of the foundation of the city,
named <ref target="roma-quadrata-2" n="U">ROMA QUADRATA</ref> (q.v.) by Festus 258, and described by Ovid,
<bibl>Fast. iv. 821</bibl> sqq., who, however, gives it no name.</p>
<p>From  this point Romulus started the furrow  (sulcus primigenius)
which was to mark the line of the enceinte of his city.  Plutarch's
statement (Rom. II), <foreign xml:lang="greek">bo/qros ga\r w)ru/gh peri\ to\ nu=n komi/tion kukloterh/s ... kalou=si de\ to\n bo/qron tou=ton w(=| kai\ to\n o)/lumqon o)no/mati mou=ndon</foreign>, is the
result of confusion; and its absurdity is increased by his placing the
centre of the city of Romulus on the Comitium.</p>
<p>In 1914, under the north-east part of the peristyle of the domus
Augustiana, a chamber with a bee-hive roof was found, the sides of which
are lined with blocks of cappellaccio (a soft tufa); in the centre of it a
circular shaft descends to two underground passages cut in the rock
(which here rises to near the surface) which diverge but (after forming a
right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 12 metres) meet again in a
rock-cut domed chamber, half of which has been destroyed by Domitian's
foundations (<bibl>YW  1914, 12-13</bibl>; <bibl>CRA 1914, 109-111</bibl>; ZA 208; <bibl>Mitt. 1926,
212-228</bibl>).</p>
<p>Leopold (Meded. Nederland. Hist. <bibl>Inst. i. (1921) 45-61</bibl>; Bull. Pal. <bibl>Ital.
1924, 193-206</bibl>) not only accepts the bee-hive chamber as the mundus
(or a mundus), but believes that traces of Roma quadrata were also
found close by, and were indeed visible before the construction of the
palace of Domitian. He notes, however, that the mundus, which is
never brought into connection with the foundation of Rome, may be a
good deal later than the first settlement on the Palatine. He further
believes that the combination of mundus and Roma quadrata was repeated
<pb n="348"/>
in the forum in the lapis niger, which was not merely an altar of the gods
of the underworld, but a record of the place on which the city was founded;
and he thus explains Plutarch's statement that it was situated in the
Comitium, and localises here (and not on the Palatine) the distribution of
suffimenta ad Romam quadratam in <date value="204">204 A.D.</date></p>
<p>The identification or juxtaposition of the mundus and Roma quadrata,
and the placing of the latter here, will not square with any of the possible
theories in regard to the site of the temple of Apollo (Fest. 258), and
it may be a late antiquarian invention.</p>

<placeName>MURCIA</placeName>
</head>
<p> the shrine of an early Roman divinity in the valley between the
Palatine and Aventine. As the circus Maximus gradually occupied all
this space, the shrine was preserved and kept its place within the circus
at the south-east end of the course on the Aventine side (<bibl>Varro v. 154</bibl>;
Fest. 148, 344; CIL i². p. 189, elog. v.; <bibl>Liv. i. 33</bibl>. 5). This end of the
course and spina was called the metae Murciae (Apul. <bibl>Met. vi. 8</bibl>; Tert.
de spect. 8). For a theory that this shrine was at the other, north-east,
end of the circus, near the carceres, see <bibl>BC 1908, 251</bibl>; M61. 1908, 279.
The shrine itself is called ara vetus (Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 121</bibl>), sacellum (Varro,
Fest.), fanum (Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 636</bibl>), aedes (Tert.), but it was probably
originally only an altar, afterwards surrounded by a puteal. It seems to
beindicatedon the Foligno relief (Ann. d. Inst. 1870, pi. LM), but this
may be the shrine of Sol rather than Murcia (Diss. d. Accad. Pont. ser. 2,
vi. 266-267). This point is often referred to as ad Murciae (Varro, Livy,
Elog. locc. citt.), and at a later period the valley of the circus was called
the vallis Murcia (Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 636</bibl>; Symmach. <bibl>Relat. ix. 6</bibl>; Claudian.
de cons. <bibl>Stilich. ii. 404</bibl>; Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iii. 51</bibl>; Pol. Silv. 545). Of the
real character of this divinity all knowledge was lost, and the Roman
antiquarians gave several explanations of the name. The most popular
was that of Varro, who derived Murcia from myrtea, on the theory that
this low ground was originally grown up with myrtle.  As the myrtle
was sacred to Venus, Murcia herself was identified with the goddess of
love (Tert.), who  then  became known as Venus Murtea or Murcia
(Varro, Pliny, Plut. q. Rom. 20). (HJ 113-114; <bibl>Rosch. ii. 3231-3233</bibl>;

description of the walls (DMH) appended to the Einsiedeln Itinerary is
generally attributed to this period (<bibl>Jord. ii. 155-178</bibl>, 578-580; DAP

refers only to the city walls.</p>
<p>One-third of the whole circuit and all the gates are said to have been
destroyed when the city was stormed by Totila, but this is an exaggeration
(Procop. <bibl>BG iii. 22</bibl>, 24); it was restored by Belisarius.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Chron. <bibl>Min. ii. 108</bibl> (<date value="547">547 A.D.</date>). He also had restored the walls before the siege by
Vitiges (Procop. <bibl>BG i. 14</bibl>).
</note>  Of the Popes,
Hadrian I and Leo IV  (the latter adding the Civitas Leonina) were
especially active in repairing the walls (<bibl>LPD i. 518</bibl>, n. 48; <bibl>ii. 137</bibl>, 138);
the Roman senate repaired them  in 1157 (v. <ref target="porta-metrovia" n="U">PORTA METROVIA</ref>), and
much was done by the Renaissance popes, as their arms show. The
greater part of the circuit remains, except along the river from near
the porta Flaminia to the pons Aurelius on the left bank, and from
the porta Aurelia to the porta Portuensis on the right bank. The
former disappeared in the Middle Ages (<bibl>ASRSP 1879, 79-121</bibl>; 137-171),
and the latter under Urban VIII, who brought the new porta Portese
about 500 metres nearer the city (for the towers on the river-bank,
see Roma iii. <bibl>(1925)</bibl>, 317), and connected it and the porta Aurelia
(S. Pancrazio) by a new line of fortifications with the Leonine city,
which had been re-fortified by Paul III and Pius IV.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the line of the walls has remained unaltered since the time
of Aurelian, except for the construction of a great bastion by Antonio da
Sangallo the younger for Paul III (see <ref target="porta-ardeatina" n="U">PORTA ARDEATINA</ref>), in pursuance
of a scheme which was not continued; and comparatively few openings
for traffic have been made, despite the growth of the modern city. The
line selected was the octroi boundary of the time of Commodus, which
was marked by cippi (<bibl>CIL vi. 1016</bibl> a-c, 8594, 31227; <bibl>BC 1892, 93</bibl> sqq.; LR 71, 72; <bibl>Mitt. 1897, 150-156</bibl>; cf. infra, fig. 2). Existing buildings
were incorporated in this, and subsequently in the wall, for about one-sixth
of the total length (such as the supporting walls of the horti Aciliorum
and horti Sallustiani, the castra Praetoria, the arches of the various
aqueducts, from porta Tiburtina to porta Maior, and the Amphitheatrum
Castrense). For the haste with which the work was done, see <bibl>BC 1892,
104-106</bibl>; LR 70-71.</p>
<p>Though the various restorations of which evidence may be seen in
the walls themselves have not yet been brought into relation with the
<pb n="350"/>
scanty historical evidence we possess, it is clear that originally the
wall was not more than 25 feet high, and that it has since been
heightened and the arcades added (see Richmond in Discovery vi.
<bibl>(1925)</bibl>, 293-295, and in <bibl>BC 1927, 41-67</bibl>).</p>
<p>The walls as they now stand form one of the finest products of the
science of Roman fortification. They are built of concrete faced with
brick, are about 12 feet thick, and of varying height, the ground level
inside being generally considerably above that outside. 13 feet from
the ground inside they are traversed by a sentinel's passage passing
through both curtain and towers, the latter occurring every 100 feet;
they are quadrangular, project about 10 feet from the curtain, and
rise about 20 feet above the wall (Ill. 33). The gates have double or
single archways, according to their importance, with flanking towers,
and only some of them have vantage courts. The material used for the
walls was largely older brick (<bibl>BC 1892, 91-93</bibl>; <bibl>PAS i. 1-86</bibl>).</p>
<p>See Nibby and Gell, Mura di Roma <bibl>(Rome 1820)</bibl> ; Jord. i. I. 340-392;

<p> * the wall ascribed by tradition (<bibl>Liv. i. 44</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys.
iv. 13</bibl>) to the sixth of the kings of Rome (ascriptions to Ancus Martius,
such as vir. ill. v. I, Flor. i. I. 14 need not be taken into account; see
Jord. i. I. 201), perhaps in completion of work already begun by Tarquinius Priscus (<bibl>Strabo v. 3</bibl>. 7, p. 234; Liv. I. 36; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 67</bibl>).</p>
<p>There is considerable discord in the tradition as to which hills were
added to the city by which kings (see <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref>) ; but the statement
that Servius Tullius added the Esquiline and the Viminal (Strabo cit.;
cf. <bibl>Dionys. iv. 13</bibl>) is consistent with the facts (<bibl>Jord. ii. 206-208</bibl>, cf.
figs. I, 3).</p>
<p>It is probable that the original settlements on the Palatine, Capitol,
Quirinal, etc., had no stone walls, but relied on natural features or
sometimes on earthworks, e.g. <ref target="murus-terreus" n="U">MURUS TERREUS CARINARUM</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>There are remains of a wall in smallish blocks of grey tufa (cappellaccio)
at various points on the line of the later enceinte, which are usually (despite
the denial of Carter in Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. xlviii. <bibl>(1909)</bibl>, 136) assigned
to the original wall of Servius Tullius of the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth century B.C.</dateRange> (Jord.
i. I. 252-253).

<pb n="351"/></p>
<p>The blocks employed are from 0.20 to 0.30 metre high, 0.55 to 0.66 wide
and 0.75 to 0.90 long. The most important sections of this wall are to
be seen:</p>
<p>(a) at the head of the Via delle Finanze, where the Villa Spithoever
once stood. This fine section of it (Ill. 36), some 35 metres long, was
discovered in 1907, but a modern street has been run through the middle
of it; while other pieces were discovered to the south-west in the garden
of the Ministry of Agriculture (LF 10 ; see Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1871, 57</bibl> ; Jord.
i.I.212, n. 23 , m, n; <bibl>NS 1885, 249</bibl>; 1907,438, 504-50; <bibl>1909, 221-223</bibl>;
<bibl>BC 1909, 119-121</bibl>; 343-348; <bibl>YW  1910, 16-17</bibl>).  Other similar remains
appear to have been found near S. Susanna and S. Maria della Vittoria
in the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange> (Bartoli, Mem. 98, ap. Fea, <bibl>Misc. i. 250</bibl>; Jord.
i. I. 212 ), and some of it was still visible in 1867 (Jord. k), though not
mentioned in other lists (<bibl>BC 1888, 15-17</bibl>).</p>
<p>(b) in the Piazza dei Cinquecento, opposite the station (<bibl>BC 1876, 122</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Another piece was found in 1926 with possible remains of a postern, almost opposite
the entrance to the offices of the Museo Nazionale Romano (Museo delle Terme) in Via

<p>(c) at the south-west angle of the Palatine (TF 93, fig. 3 ; Delbriick,
Tempel des Apollo im Marsfelde, pl. iii., reproduced by Stuart Jones,
Companion, p. 32, fig. 7, and ASA 3, 4, is better).</p>
<p>(d) on the north side of the Capitol, under the retaining wall in
front of the German Embassy above the Vicolo della Rupe Tarpea
(Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1871, 49-51</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1872, 139</bibl>) ; omitted by Jord. i. I. 207,
regarding it as a part of the substructions of the area of the temple
of Jupiter (supra, 48, 96; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 74; <bibl>BC 1875, 182</bibl>, 183; Ann.
d. <bibl>Inst. 1876, 149</bibl>; cf. Ficoroni, Vestigia, i. 42; Piranesi, Antichita,
i. pl. 44.2).  The two probably coincided at this point.</p>
<p>(e) in the garden of the Palazzo Colonna at the west end of the
Quirinal (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1852, 324</bibl>; Jord. d, i. I. 211, n. 18).</p>
<p>Of these fragments of wall, (a) and (e) undoubtedly belonged to the
outer line, while (b) was the retaining wall at the back of the agger, which,
no doubt, existed from the first. Of (d) we can say nothing certain, and
(c) may belong either to the Palatine or to the Servian enceinte.</p>
<p>To ascribe them to the wall of the city of the Four Regions is impossible, as (a) and (b) would both then be excluded ; and it is very doubtful
if this city ever had a wall of its own.</p>
<p>Frank maintains (TF 117, 18) that the battering back of the courses,
the use of anathyrosis and the presence of walls of Grotta Oscura tufa
of the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century B.C.</dateRange> in conjunction with these fragments, are
sufficient to make it probable that they should also be assigned to the
same period.</p>
<p>It seems, however, more likely that the cappellaccio wall should, as far
as our knowledge goes at present, be attributed to the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth century B.C.</dateRange><note anchored="true" place="foot"> To attribute it to the fifth or the earlier part of the fourth, and the agger itself to
the sixth, supposing that neither the inner nor the outer walls were integral parts of the original agger (PI. 45, 115, 116), is simply to leave the agger in the air, as either of its
ends could easily have been turned. Of course it might be a tenable hypothesis, admitting
that' all weak points of the circuit were fortified in this way' (LR 62; cf. NS 1884. 223;
<bibl>BC 1892, 284</bibl>) that there was at first no wall connected with any of the aggeres and that
for the rest of the line the cliffs of the various hills were considered to afford sufficient
defence, but it seems to be highly improbable.
</note>
<pb n="352"/></p>
<p>The line of wall (text fig. 3) began at the Tiber, crossed the low ground
to the south-west corner of the Capitol, ran north-east along the edge of
the cliffs of this hill and the Quirinal, until it almost reached the head of
the valley between the Quirinal and the Pincian (Collis Hortorum). Then
it ran southwards across the tableland of the Esquiline, crossed the valley
between the mons Oppius and the Caelian, followed the cliffs on the
south-east and south of this hill, then probably followed the south-west
side of the Palatine, and thence ran south of the forum Boarium to the
Tiber again.</p>
<p>It is possible that we should attribute to the enceinte of this period
an arch with a span of 12 Roman feet (3.30 metres), found in 1885 forty
metres south of S. Maria in Cosmedin and constructed of voussoirs of
cappellaccio (<bibl>NS 1886, 274</bibl>; cf. <bibl>AJA 1918, 175-176</bibl>). Its left (south-
east) side joined a wall of the same material, which ran into the hill. A
paved road passed through it, which was taken to be the <ref target="clivus-publicius" n="U">CLIVUS PUBLICIUS</ref>
(q.v.), but it had been blocked up by a wall in opus reticulatum. Borsari
(<bibl>BC 1888, 21</bibl>) maintained that it was the PORTA TRIGEMINA (q.v.), but
it is most improbable that the road passing through it would have been
blocked up at so early a period as the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century A.D.</dateRange> Nor, as
Hulsen points out (<bibl>Mitt. 1889, 260</bibl>), does its position suit what we know
of the line of the Servian wall. Frank (AJA cit.) attributed it to the wall
of the ' City of the four regions,' omitting the Aventine; but later,
apparently forgetting the information he had obtained from Lanciani
(who stated that, as far as he could remember, the material was cappellaccio), he assumed that the material was Fidenae tufa, which is full of
scoriae, and that it belonged to the Palatine wall of the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>
B.C. (TF 95, 96).</p>
<p>It is probable that a consequence of the Etruscan victory over the
Romans at the beginning of the Republic was the dismantling of the
fortifications of the city. A treaty such as that concluded with Porsena,
in which the Romans were forbidden to carry weapons of iron (Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxiv. 139</bibl>; Mommsen, Rom. <bibl>Hist. i. 414</bibl>), would doubtless have included
this: and the success of the Gallic invasion can hardly be understood Prof. Hulsen has kindly communicated this view to me, and I fully agree with it.
unless Rome was an open town.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Prof. Hulsen has kindly communicated this view to me, and I fully agree with it.
</note></p>
<p>As the result of the Gallic invasion, the whole enceinte was enormously
reinforced and strengthened, the original line, however, being for the
most part, if not entirely, retained.</p>
<p>To the construction of this wall the following passages have generally
been referred:
<pb n="353"/></p>
<p><bibl>Liv. vi. 32</bibl>. I:<foreign xml:lang="la"> ut tribute novum fenus contraheretur in murum a

<p>vii. 20. 9:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Legionibus Romam reductis relicum anni muris turribusque
reficiendis consumptum </foreign>(<date value="-353">353 B.C.</date>).</p>
<p>It is natural that so great a work as this should have taken a considerable number of years to build.</p>
<p>To this reconstruction belongs all the masonry of larger blocks.
Frank remarks that, though the majority of the blocks measure 58-61 cm.
high, there is a good deal of irregularity even on the outer face, where he
<pb n="354"/>
has noted measures as low as 51 cm. and as high as 64, while on the inside,
where the agger conceals the blocks, the measurements vary from 40 to
68 cm. The material, however, is entirely Grotta Oscura tufa ; and this
seems an even clearer test than that of measurement. The quarry marks
too (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1876, 72</bibl>; Richter, Antike Steinmetzzeichen) cannot
be referred to an earlier period than the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century B.C.</dateRange>, and, as
the stone came from the Grotta Oscura quarries, in the territory of Veii,
soon after the fall of that town, it is suggested that they may be Etruscan
rather than Roman (<bibl>AJP 1924, 68-69</bibl>). In this enceinte the Aventine
was for the first time probably included; and a fine piece of wall belonging
to it may be seen in the depression between the greater and the lesser
Aventine in the Via di Porta S. Paolo. As this meant an increased
weakness from  the defensive point of view, it was quite natural that
the builders of the original wall should have left it and the valley of the
circus Maximus out of their scheme (Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1855, 87-92</bibl>; Klio
191, 93; <bibl>AJA 1918, 78</bibl>; TF 119, 20,where,asitstands,itisattributed
to <dateRange from="-90" to="-80">90-80</dateRange> B.C., but the presence of blocks from the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> wall is
maintained). The continuation has been cleared to the north-west of
it on the greater Aventine (Gnomon, iii. 191, 192) and is almost entirely
of Grotta Oscura tufa.</p>
<p>From the porta Collina to the porta Esquilina, where the Servian
wall, instead of following the edge of the hill, was obliged to cross the
tableland at the base of the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline, it was
strengthened by a great mound, described by Dionysius (ix. 68; cf. iv. 54)
as seven stadia in length and 50 feet thick, with a ditch in front of it
30 Roman feet deep and 100 wide (Cic. de Rep. ii. I I; Varro ap. Censorin.
17. 8; <bibl>Strab. v. 3</bibl>. 7, p. 234; Plin. <bibl>NH iii. 67</bibl>; <bibl>xxxvi. 104</bibl>). The porta
Viminalis was the only gate which passed through this part of the fortifications, which were further strengthened by towers. With a part of
the outer wall of the agger near by, it is still preserved in the railway
station.  Another piece may be seen in the Piazza Manfredo Fanti
(LF 23).</p>
<p>Other parts of the enceinte were fortified in the same way; but this
was the agger par excellence, and long after its function had ceased it is
spoken of by ancient authors as a prominent feature (Hor. <bibl>Sat. i. 8</bibl>. 13:
aggere in aprico spatiari; see <ref target="puticuli" n="U">PUTICULI</ref>; Juv. 8. 43: ventoso sub aggere),
and it was indeed the highest point in Rome. It was thus used to denote
a quarter of the city (pomarius de agger(e) a proseucha, <bibl>CIL vi. 9821</bibl>);
and (in contrast with the campus Viminalis sub aggere of the Notitia,
which lay between the porta Viminalis and the castra Praetoria; <bibl>Mitt.
1891, 113</bibl>) we get a district known as super aggerem (Hist. Aug. Elag. 30:
cum alter maneret in Capitolio, alter in Palatio, alter super aggerem, alter
in Caelio, alter trans Tiberim), and it survived as a local name in the form
Superage as late as 1051 (<foreign xml:lang="la">in loco qui vocatur Superage non longe a Sancta
Maria Maiore</foreign>), from  which the church took the name of Superagius
<pb n="355"/>
(<bibl>ASRSP 1889, 199-213</bibl>; De Rossi, Piante 13), and even in 1527 (Fulvius,
antiq. 1. ii. f. 21 ter, G.i.).</p>
<p>Many other portions of the wall are preserved, but are too insignificant
to deserve separate mention, with the exception of an arch on the slope
of the Quirinal, in the modern Palazzo Antonelli,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The statement in Gnomon, i. 300, that a piece of the Servian wall had been found
in the Via Mazzarino rests on a misconception of the position of this arch and of the line
taken by the wall, and is, further, incorrect, as the blocks were not in situ.

For the remains on the Capitol, see <ref target="arx" n="U">ARX</ref>.</p>
<p>We cannot admit either that the Palatine was still a separate community when the wall of blocks 2 feet high was built on its north-west side
or that this wall was part of a larger enceinte; and we must therefore
suppose that it continued to be separately fortified as late as the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth
century B.C.</dateRange> as an additional internal citadel or fort (<bibl>CR 1902, 336</bibl>;

ran round the north-west edge of the Oppius and extended as far east

work was on the summit of the hill, or just a little way down on the slope,
and that it belonged to the system of fortification of the Oppius at that
early period when such earth walls were still in use and the settlements
on this and the adjacent hills were independent of each other (Pinza,

combats on a great scale in connection with the dedication of the temple
of Mars Ultor (<bibl>Veil. ii. 100</bibl>; Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 43-44</bibl>; Suet. Aug. 43; Tac.
<bibl>Ann. xii. 56</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 25</bibl>; Euseb. ad a. Abr. 2014).  It was 1800
Roman feet (536 metres) long and 1200 (357) wide (Mon. Anc. loc. cit.),
and was supplied with water by the aqua Alsietina, built by Augustus
for this purpose (Frontinus, de aq. i. I , 22). Around the naumachia was
a grove, nemus Caesarum, laid out by Augustus (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiv. 15</bibl>) in
honour of Gaius and Lucius Caesar (Mon. Anc. loc. cit.; Suet. Aug. 43;

In the centre of the basin was an island (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 25</bibl>), and Pliny
speaks twice (<bibl>NH xvi. 190</bibl>, 200) of a pons naumachiarius, restored by
Tiberius after fire, which may have been built across the basin to serve
as a support for some of the apparatus of the games. This naumachia
was used by Nero (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxii. 20</bibl>; Suet. Nero 12 ?) and Titus (Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxvi. 25</bibl>; Suet. Tit. 7), and is mentioned in <date value="95">95 A.D.</date> (Stat. <bibl>Silv. iv.

parts of it remained (Cass. Dio Iv. IO). For a possible restoration, see

<p>This naumachia was previously located nearly opposite the theatre

For a full discussion of the identification of this building, its history, and
bibliography, see Hulsen in DAP 2. viii. 353-388; HJ 660-661 (cf. <bibl>BC 1914, 394-5</bibl> for objections). He believes that this was the work of
Trajan, to whose period the brick-facing belongs (<bibl>AJA 1912, 417</bibl>), perhaps
a rebuilding of that of Domitian in the same or another place, and that
it had been abandoned by the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> (Procop. BG ii. I). It would
then have been one of the two naumachiae of Not.; and from it came the
name regio naumachiae, which was in use as early as the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange>

These indications of locality are sufficiently vague, and various sites have
been proposed. Hulsen places them below the narrowest part of the
river, in the neighbourhood of the Palazzo Farnese (HJ 485-486).</p>
<p>If the reference to Rome were certain, the earliest mention of them
would be in a line of Ennius (ap. Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. xi. 326</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">idem campus

in <date value="-167">167 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. xlv. 35</bibl>. 3; 42. 12: <foreign xml:lang="la">naves regiae ... in campo Martio

porticum extra portam Trigeminam, et aliam post navalia [et] ad fanum
Herculis, et post Spei a Tiberi ad aedem Apollinis Medici</foreign> (<bibl>Liv. xl. 51</bibl>)
has led Hulsen (DAP 2. vi. 246-254) to argue that, as the <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus post
navalia [et] ad fanum Herculis</foreign>-the argument seems to apply whether
we omit the et of the MSS. or not-must be intermediate between the
other two porticus, those extra portam Trigeminam and post Spei, we
have an indication of the existence of other earlier Navalia further downstream just north of the porta Trigemina. But the very existence of the
last portico depends on our acceptance of Becker's correction of the
reading of the MSS., which give <foreign xml:lang="la">post Spei ad Tiberim aedem</foreign><ref target="apollo-aedes" n="U">APOLLINIS
MEDICI</ref> (q.v.). Still, it would be difficult to suppose that any other
temple of Hercules was meant than that of Hercules Victor; and if we
refer the passage to the navalia in the campus Martius, the temple of
Hercules must have been one of the two near the circus Flaminius (see
<ref target="hercules-custos-aedes" n="U">HERCULES CUSTOS</ref>, <ref target="hercules-custos-aedes" n="U">HERCULES MUSARUM</ref>) and the porticus becomes
altogether too extensive.</p>
<p>It is also very natural to suppose that the navalia of the early republic
(the first mention of navalia comes in reference to <date value="-338">338 B.C.</date>, <bibl>Liv. viii. 14</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">naves Antiatium partim in navalia Romae subductae</foreign>) were under the
protection of the Servian walls, and therefore situated on the Tiber
bank between the porta Carmentalis and the porta Trigemina. And the
description of the arrival from  Epidaurus of the sacred serpent of
Aesculapius and especially the words ' <foreign xml:lang="la">egressis legatis</foreign> ' in Val. <bibl>Max. i. 8</bibl>. 2,
which show that the ship had reached its destination (v. <ref target="aesculapius-aedes" n="U">AESCULAPIUS,

on his return from Cyprus (Plut. Cat. min. 39 ; <bibl>Vell. ii. 45</bibl>), which describes
his landing at the navalia and passing through the forum to deposit the
treasures of Ptolemy in the aerarium Saturni and on the Capitol, both
suit such a site.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems very doubtful whether the expression
of Procopius (<bibl>BG iv. 22</bibl>) in regard to the ship of Aeneas, which was
preserved in his day at the navalia <foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n me/sh| th=| po/lei</foreign> need refer to the

<p>Hulsen also thinks that a coin of Antoninus Pius (Coh. No. 7 ; cf.
Zeitschr. f. <bibl>Num. 1900, 32</bibl>) represents, not a bridge, but the navalia with
the Aventine in the background (cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1886, 168</bibl>; <bibl>1900, 352-354</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See, however, <bibl>JRS 1911, 187-195</bibl>.
</note>
A painting known to us only by drawings, which had been attributed to
the Aventine (<bibl>Mitt. 1896, 213-226</bibl>) has been rightly referred to Puteoli by
Hulsen (HJ 322), Dubois (Pouzzoles antique 201-219) and Carcopino
(Rev. Arch. 1913, ii. 253-270; cf. <bibl>PBS vii. 57-58</bibl>; CILvi. 36613).</p>
<p>The fragment of the forma Urbis (61) with the inscription <foreign xml:lang="la">NAVALEMFER</foreign>,
which Hulsen had brought in as an argument, he now prefers to omit, as
the external characteristics of the fragment make it impossible to place
it in the neighbourhood of the circus Maximus; so that it probably
belongs to the region of the horrea, south of the Aventine (HJ 145, n. 8 ;
but the necessary alterations have not been made in the plans attached

mentioned on an inscription of the Flavian period (<bibl>CIL vi. 8423</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Abascanti Aug. lib. aedituo aedis Neptuni quae est in circo Flaminio</foreign>), and
without doubt by Pliny (<bibl>NH xxxvi. 26</bibl>), who states that a famous group
by Scopas of Neptune, Thetis, Achilles, the Nereids and Tritons, Phorcus
and his crew, sea-monsters, etc., was <foreign xml:lang="la">in delubro Cn. Domitii in circo
Flaminio</foreign>. A coin of Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus (<bibl>RE v. 1331</bibl>, No. 25),
struck between <date value="-42">42</date> and <date value="-38">38 B.C.</date> (Babelon, <bibl>Monnaies i. 466</bibl>, Domitia 20,
BM. <bibl>Rep. ii. 487</bibl>. 93), represents a tetrastyle temple with the legend
Nept. Cn. Domitius M. f. Imp. This indicates that the temple was vowed
at least between 42 and 38, but it may not have been built before 32,
when Domitius had been reconciled to Augustus and held the consulship.
The group of Scopas he probably brought from Bithynia, his province.
The day of dedication of this temple was Ist December (Fast. Amit. ad
Kal. Dec., CIL i². p. 245, 335). To this temple also have been held to belong
the parts of a frieze that were preserved (though this is no proof of their
provenance) in the Palazzo Santacroce and are now in Paris and Munich
<pb n="361"/>
(cf. however <ref target="mars-ara" n="U">MARTIS, ARA</ref>). In style and execution this frieze belongs
to the <dateRange from="-50" to="-1">second half of the first century B.C.</dateRange>, and it evidently surrounded
either an altar or, more probably, a pedestal, in the temple. This
pedestal may well have been that on which Domitius placed the Scopas
group. Part of the frieze represents a lustratio of the army of the period
before Marius, and probably was a memorial of the victory of the
great-grandfather of the builder of the temple, who was victorious over
the Celts on the Isere in 121 and censor in 115 (for the discussion of these
reliefs, and their bearing on the date of the temple, see Furtwangler,
Intermezzi, <bibl>Berlin 1896, 35-48</bibl>; Brunn, Bayr. Sitz. <bibl>Ber. 1876, 342-344</bibl>;

1909, 77-82</bibl>; <bibl>OJ 1910, 95-111</bibl> ; <bibl>AD iii. 12</bibl>). Remains of substructures
and of six columns of a pycnostyle temple, belonging without much
doubt to this temple of Neptune, have been found north-west of the
Piazza S. Salvatore (<bibl>BC 1873, 212-221</bibl>, pl. vi.; Bursian's <bibl>Jahresb. 1873,
787-789</bibl>).
It is impossible to determine whether Domitius built an entirely
new temple, or restored that which previously existed in circo Flaminio
(see <ref target="neptunus-ara" n="U">ARA NEPTUNI</ref> above; HJ 522-523; WR 227; <bibl>Rosch. iii. 203-204</bibl>;

<p> so called in distinction from the Sacra via, the second of the

itself of great antiquity (<bibl>Varro vi. 59</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">quod vocabulum ei pervetustum
ut novae viae quae via iam diu vetus</foreign>). It began at the north-east corner
of the Palatine, near the temple of Jupiter Stator, where it branched
off from the Sacra via, and ran along the north slope of the hill to its
north-west corner (<bibl>Liv. i. 41</bibl>. 4: <foreign xml:lang="la">ex superiore parte aedium per fenestras

At its beginning it was called summa nova via (<bibl>Solin. i. 24</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Tarquinius
Priscus ad Mugoniam portam supra summam novam  viam (habitavit</foreign>)),
and at the north-west corner of the hill, above the temple of Vesta,

<p>Along this line, on the north side of the hill, the Nova via of the empire
has been excavated. Its pavement lies at 23.40 metres above sea-level
behind the atrium Vestae, and at 32.30 metres at its junction with the
clivus Palatinus. The earlier pavement has been found at least at one
point beneath the later (<bibl>NS 1882, 234-238</bibl>, 413 ; <bibl>1884, 191</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1905, 76</bibl>;
<bibl>AJA 1923, 392</bibl>). It is possible that the original road was a little to the
north of the later, and that the successive enlargements of the atrium
Vestae and the building of the enormous substructures of the imperial
palace which now span the street changed its first line somewhat.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For the facade of a house of the Antonine period, see Architettura ed Arti Decorative,
iii. <bibl>(1924)</bibl>,   16,7.
</note> At
the north-west corner of the Palatine the straight line of the Nova via
is blocked completely by the large hall belonging to the complex of
buildings between the bibliotheca Augusti and the lacus Iuturnae (<bibl>Mitt.
1902, 73-74</bibl>), but it is connected with the clivus Victoriae above and the
forum below by a flight of steps and an inclined way. It is evident,
therefore, that the construction of the temple of <ref target="augustus-divus-templum" n="U">AUGUSTUS</ref> (q.v.) and
the adjacent structures changed the conditions so completely that the
original course of the street beyond this point is only a matter of conjecture. We are told, however, that it ended in the Velabrum (<bibl>Varro
vi. 24</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">in Velabro qua in novam viam exitur</foreign>; <bibl>v. 43</bibl> loc. cit.; <bibl>v. 164</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">alteram Romanulam ab Roma dictam quae habet gradus in nova via
(sic Scaliger; novalia, vulg.) ad Volupiae sacellum</foreign>), and also that in Ovid's
time it was connected with the forum (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 396</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">qua nova
Romano nunc via iuncta foro est</foreign>). There is no doubt that the original
street ran into the Velabrum (cf. however, <bibl>NS 1882, 234-238</bibl>), near the
<ref target="porta-romana" n="U">PORTA ROMANULA</ref> (q.v.), which is usually placed near the church of
S. Teodoro, although the relation between the Nova via and the clivus
Victoriae becomes thereby somewhat dubious. The connection with the
forum referred to by Ovid may have been effected by an inclined way
turning to the north. It has been suggested that the original road
followed the supposed line of the Palatine pomerium (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>)
on the north and west sides of the hill (<bibl>Hermes 1885, 428</bibl>; HJ 37), but
this is very doubtful.</p>
<p>In Greek the Nova via appears as <foreign xml:lang="greek">h( kainh\ o(do/s</foreign>(Plut. Cam. 14; defort.

<p> a monumental fountain, fed by the aqua lulia (LA
393-395), between the via Tiburtina vetus and the via Labicana. The
existing remains, of brick-faced concrete, show a two-storied facade
with a wide central niche and arched openings on each side. In front,
was a curved basin into which the water flowed from the building behind
(Durm, fig. 543; for list of further illustrations, see HJ 348). In the
side openings stood the marble trophies (trophaea) which were removed
in 1590 by Sixtus V and set up on the balustrade of the Piazza del
Campidoglio (<bibl>LS iii. 168</bibl>; HF i. p. 409). Their style is certainly Domitianic (<bibl>SScR i. 128</bibl>, who attributes them to Domitian's double triumph
over the Chatti and Dacians in <date value="89">89 A.D.</date>), but they were not made for this
setting, but for another, in which a Victory stood between them (Mitt.
1923-4, 185-192). A quarry mark of Domitian is said to have been seen
under one of them (Cittadini ap. Martinelli, Roma ex ethn. sacra, 430;
<bibl>Mitt. 1891, 44</bibl>; HJ 349, n. 16) and an inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 1207</bibl>=31263),
<pb n="364"/>
quoted by Petrarch and copied (in part only), near the Lateran about 1470,
may also be attributed to that emperor (<bibl>Mitt. 1899, 255-259</bibl>).</p>
<p>Despite what has been said to the contrary, however, the brickwork
of the structure itself is not of the time of Domitian, but probably
of Alexander Severus, on whose coins the building appears to be
represented (Cohen 297-303, 479, 480).</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages this nymphaeum had already been connected
with Marius and his triumph over the Cimbri, and it appears as Cimbrum
in a document of 1176 (<bibl>Jord. ii. 517</bibl>), in the Mirabilia and the Ordo
Benedicti (<bibl>Jord. ii. 640</bibl>, 665); as templum Marii (Ordo Benedicti, Mira-
bilia, locc. citt.), and as Marii Cimbrum (Petrarch, <bibl>Ep. vi. 2</bibl>; <bibl>Rem. i. 118</bibl>).
Poggio (ap. Urlichs, 236) says that this templum was built by Marius
from the spoils of the Cimbri and that his trophaea were still visible
on the monument, confusing these trophies with the MARII MONUMENTA
(q.v.). This confusion may have been due to the fact that, after the
damnatio memoriae, Domitian's name was erased from so many inscriptions that some of his buildings were attributed to others (HJ 348-350;
Durm  475; Maass, Die Tagesgotter in Rom u. den Provinzen, <bibl>Berlin

<p> on the Esquiline, between the via Labicana and the
Aurelian wall, just inside the line of the Anio vetus. There is no mention
of this structure in ancient literature or inscriptions, but it is without
doubt a monumental nymphaeum. The existing ruins consist of a
decagonal hall of opus latericium, which was covered with a domed
roof until part of it fell in in 1828, surrounded on three sides with other
chambers added at a later date. In the interior of the hall are nine
niches, besides the entrance; and above these are ten corresponding
round-arched windows. The diameter of the hall is about 24 metres,
and the height was 33. It is very important from the structural point
of view, and especially for the meridian ribs in the dome. The outside
walls were covered with marble and the interior richly decorated in a
similar manner (Durm, figs. 306-308, 313, 339; Choisy, pl. x. i. pp.82-84;

Antinous was buried, just outside the limits of the city (<bibl>Mitt. 1896,

that the body of Antinous was actually brought to Rome or not. The
fragments of this obeliskwere set up in 1570 in the vigna Saccoccia outside
porta Maggiore at a point marked by an inscription recording the fact, which
was fixed to one of the piers of the aqua Claudia, about 360 metres east of
the Aurelian wall. This was made one of the piers of the acqua Felice in

the Barberini to their palace, and afterwards presented to Clement XIV
(1769-1777). It lay in the Giardino della Pigna in the Vatican until 1822,
when Pius VII erected it on the Pincian. The obelisk is about 9 metres
high, and may have stood at the entrance to the tomb or cenotaph of
Antinous, perhaps with another of the same size (<bibl>NS 1922, 137</bibl>-where

had been slightly displaced by an earthquake (Plin. NH  xxxvi 73).
About 1484, and at various times in the next century, portions of the
pavement were found, with the gilt lines, and figures in mosaic around
the edge representing the winds and different heavenly bodies, but they
were covered up again and are not visible (<bibl>LS i. 83</bibl>, 136, 169; HJ 611,

a pavement extending about 110 metres east and west, and 60 north
and south (HJ 601-612; LR 466-468; <bibl>CIL vi. 29820</bibl>).</p>

the entrances of the temple of Isis (<ref target="isis" n="U">ISEUM</ref>, q.v.), which stood between
the Saepta and the temple of Minerva:</p>
<p>(1) that now standing above the fountain in front of the Pantheon.
This belongs to the time of Rameses II and stood in front of the temple
of Ra at Heliopolis. It is 6 metres high and covered with hieroglyphics
(<bibl>BC 1896, 260-264</bibl>=Ob. Eg. 91-95). It is referred to in the <dateRange from="1400" to="1499">fifteenth
century</dateRange> (Poggio ap. Urlichs, p. 24) as lying in the piazza in front of
S. Macuto (Arm. 317), but in the sixteenth it had already been set up
there (Fulvius, Antiquit. Urbis lxxi.), and it is also marked on the map of
Bufalini.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It was engraved probably by Du Perac (Hulsen, Das Speculum des Lafreri in Collectanea L. S. Olschki oblata, p. 164, No. 117).
</note> In  1711 Clement XI removed it to its present position.</p>
<p>(2) that now standing on Bernini's elephant in the Piazza della
Minerva, where it was placed by Alexander VII in 1667. It was erected
at Sais by Pharaoh Apries in the <dateRange from="-599" to="-550">first half of the sixth century B.C.</dateRange>, and
has only four lines of hieroglyphics (<bibl>BC 1896, 284-288</bibl>=Ob. Eg. 115-119).
Nothing was known of it until it was found in 1665 (<bibl>BC 1883, 45</bibl>).</p>
<p>(3) that now standing in the Viale delle Terme, which was found
in 1883 under the apse of S. Maria sopra Minerva (<bibl>NS 1883, 244</bibl>).
It is about 6 metres high with hieroglyphics (<bibl>BC 1883, 72-103</bibl>; <bibl>1896,
265-269</bibl>=Ob. Eg. 96-100), and was erected by Rameses II at Heliopolis.</p>
<p>(4) Another of the obelisks that were probably set up in the precinct
of Isis is that which stands on Bernini's fountain in the Piazza Navona.
This seems to have been made in Egypt by order of Domitian, and
brought to Rome where the hieroglyphics were cut. They allude to the
repair of that which was ruined, i.e. the Iseum. When the circus of
Maxentius was built on the via Appia, the obelisk was transported
thither and erected on the spina. It lay among the ruins of the circus
until 1651 when Innocent X placed it in its present position (<bibl></bibl><bibl>BC 1897, 201-207</bibl><bibl>=Ob. Eg. 125-131; </bibl><bibl>JRS 1919, 188</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1908, 254-272</bibl>; <bibl>1917,

<p>(5)-(7) Besides these, Ligorio (Bodl. 75v, quoted in <bibl>BC 1883, 42</bibl>, 43),
mentions three more similar obelisks, one of which had been excavated
in front of the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva (cf. Aldrovandi, Statue
di Roma, 314); this is in all probability that which passed into the
possession of the Medici, and remained in their villa on the Pincio until
1787 (<bibl>LS iii. 114</bibl>, 121 ; Doc. <bibl>Ined. iv. 78</bibl>, No. 54), when it was removed
to the Boboli gardens in Florence, as it has inscriptions almost identical
with those of (1). The remains of the other two were built into modern
houses, but had, he says, the same measurements and the same hieroglyphics. These fragments, three in number, were given to Cardinal
Alessandro Albani (Valesio, Diario, 16 Aug. 1702 ap. Cancellieri, Mercato
164, and Nibby, Roma <bibl>Antica ii. 290</bibl>), who presented them to the city
of Urbino in <date value="1737">1737</date>, where they now stand (made up into one obelisk)
with another fragment (probably not enumerated, as being without any
<pb n="370"/>
inscription) in front of the church of S. Domenico. They have inscriptions of the time of Apries like (2) (see Ungarelli, Interpretatio Obeliscorum Urbis, p. x.). For a drawing of one of the fragments, see <bibl>Heemskerck i. 63</bibl>b=Vat. Lat. 3437, 5v: and of all three, Kircher (Obelisci
Aegyptiaci nuper inter Isaei Romani rudera effossi interpretatio <bibl>(Rome,
1666)</bibl>, 134, 135 .</p>
<p>(8) Another obelisk lies buried not far from S. Luigi dei Francesi, about
which no particulars can be given, as it has never been excavated
(Buonarroti, ser. 3, vol. i. <bibl>(1882)</bibl>, 41-59; Roma, ii. <bibl>(1924)</bibl>, 505-509).</p>
<p>(9) A portion of another small obelisk which may have come from
the Iseum is described and illustrated by Kircher, op. cit. 135, 136, as
existing in the Palazzo Cavalieri-Maffei in Piazza Branca, now Piazza
Cairoli (LF 21). It was later in Villa Albani (Zoega, De Origine Obeliscorum, 80), and appears to have been sent to Paris; from there it was
brought, with Cavaceppi's restorations, to the Glyptothek at Munich
(Furtwangler-Wolters, Katalog, No. 22). The inscription  is much
injured, and the T. Sextius Africanus mentioned in it has not been
identified with certainty with either of the two known men of this name,
one of the time of Claudius and Nero, the other of the time of Trajan
(<bibl>Pros. iii. 236</bibl>. 464, 465). If the two obelisks from the temple of Fortune
at Praeneste, which belong to the time of Claudius (one is still there, the
other in Naples: see <bibl>BC 1904, 252-257</bibl>; Guida del Museo di Napoli,
p.  18, No. 335), can rightly be called counterparts of it, the identification
should be with the former.</p>

considerably farther to the west, a square with sides of about 1000

<p> * the centremost of the seven hills of Rome, an irregular
quadrilateral in shape, and about 2 kilometres in circuit. Its highest
point is 43 metres above the level of the Tiber, and 51.20 above sea-level;
and its area was about 25 acres. According to tradition, it was the
first of the hills to be occupied by a settlement; and some authorities
think that ritual reasons had much to do with its selection. Pigorini
believed that the Prisci Latini occupied it owing to its similarity in shape
to that of the rectangular ' terremare ' of the plain of the Po, from which
<pb n="375"/>
they came, and also to the fact that it was surrounded by streams. He
further favoured the derivation from palus (Perche l' antica Roma e
sorta sul Palatino, in Archivio Storico per la Sicilia Orientale, xv.).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> pp. 248-256 <bibl>(Miscellanea Orsi, 1921)</bibl>. The straight lines shown on modern plans,
however, are those created by the buildings of the Empire, and prove nothing as to its
original condition (HJ 35, n. 15).
</note> To
others the natural advantages of its position seem sufficient.</p>
<p>It was a flat-topped hill with two distinct summits,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The position of the depression between them is roughly marked by the older cryptoporticus on the east of the <ref target="augustus-domus-2" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTI</ref> (q.v.): see <ref target="septimontium" n="U">SEPTIMONTIUM</ref>.
</note> the Palatium
and Cermalus (the former name does not appear to have extended over
the whole hill until the <dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third century B.C.</dateRange>-see below-though in common
parlance it may have done so earlier), protected by lofty cliffs far more
formidable than they seem at present (v. <ref target="doliola" n="U">DOLIOLA</ref> for the discovery of
republican buildings under the arch of Janus Quadrifrons, which show
that the valley was originally much deeper than it now appears to be)
and almost entirely surrounded by two marshy valleys traversed by
winding streams, being connected only by the narrow ridge of the Velia
(on the summit of which stands the arch of Titus) with the Oppius, an
outlying part of the Esquiline. It was thus a position of great natural
strength, and its neighbourhood to the river gave it the command of the
crossing of the Tiber, probably a ford at or near the site of the pons
Sublicius. This crossing was of great importance, for it was the only
permanent one on the whole of the lower course of the river.</p>
<p>The usual form of the name is Palatium, the substantive form differentiating it from all the other hills on the left bank of the Tiber,
except the Capitolium. The word is generally connected with the root
pa-, which appears in pasco and Pales; but this etymology is disputed.</p>
<p>We find variations both in form and quantity-e.g. Palatualis (Ennius
ap. Varro, <bibl>LL vii. 45</bibl>), Palatuar (Fest. 348). Naevius brings it into
association with balare and calls it Balatium (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 53</bibl>; Fest.
220; cf. <bibl>Solin. i. 14</bibl>). Even Martial (i. 70. 5; <bibl>ix. 101</bibl>. 13) makes the d long.</p>
<p>The ancient tradition (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 164</bibl>; Fest. 266 Mtill.; Tac. <bibl>Ann.
xii. 24</bibl>; Plut. Rom. 3 ; <bibl>Dionys. i. 87</bibl>; Liv. I. 7 ; <bibl>Gell. xiii. 14</bibl>) is unanimous in placing on the Palatine the earliest nucleus of Rome, and modern
scholars have generally agreed (Mommsen, RG9 <bibl>(1903)</bibl>, 47; Jord.
i. I. 162; Richter 30; HJ 35; Rose in <bibl>JRS 1922, 106</bibl> sqq.). Though
some recent investigators have cast doubts on it for various reasons,
none of them  is of sufficient validity; Pinza (Mon. L. xv. <bibl>(1905)</bibl>,
747) resolves the city into isolated villages on the different hills, so
that the Palatine loses its primacy; while Carter (<bibl>AJA 1908, 172-183</bibl>;
<bibl>AJP  1908, 325</bibl>) is equally sceptical; but cf. Hilsen in Geogr. Jahrb.
xxxiv. <bibl>(1911)</bibl>, 191, 192.</p>
<p>The legend of the <ref target="lupercal" n="U">LUPERCAL</ref> (q.v.) speaks also for the early dating
of the foundation of the Palatine settlement; nor can it be proved that
the Luperci Collini were earlier than those of the Palatine; cf. Fest.

it was a Latin community, and no Etruscans had as yet reached Latium
(REi.A. 1013; cf.Klio 1905,85; Korte in <bibl>RE vi.743</bibl>). <ref target="roma-quadrata-1" n="U">ROMAQUADRATA</ref>
is also recent in its extended sense (<bibl>BPW 1903, 1645</bibl>). It could not arise
till Palatium and Cermalus were one; and in the lists of the Argei (<dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third
century B.C.</dateRange>) they are still separate (Wissowa, Ges. Abh. 224).
The fortifications of the Palatine present something of a puzzle.
It is most likely that the original settlers relied on the great natural
strength of the hill; and that the remains of defensive walls of the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth
century B.C.</dateRange>, which are to be found at the north-west corner (there are
a few blocks higher up also) of the hill, belong either to a separate enceinte
contemporary with the Servian wall of the whole city, or to this wall
itself (see <ref target="murus-servii-tullii" n="U">MURUS SERVII TULLII</ref>) ; while those of the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century</dateRange>-
generally known as the wall of Romulus-on the west and south sides
of the hill, may belong to a separate fort, erected perhaps in <date value="-378">378 B.C.</date>,
further remains of which may be seen near the top of the Scalae Caci
(TF 91-102). Whatever may be our view as to the non-inclusion of the
Aventine, the fragments of walling on the west side and high up on the
south (if these last are correctly explained) must belong to a separate
enceinte, even if those low down on the south did not. Cf. Ann. d. <bibl>Inst.
1871, 44</bibl> (the fourth and fifth pieces are no longer visible: for the fifth
cf. Visconti e Lanciani, Guida del Palatino, plan No. 26, and see <ref target="porta-mugonia" n="U">PORTA
MUGONIA</ref>); <bibl>1884, 189-204</bibl>; Richter, 133, 134). Bagnani suggests that
the object of a separate enceinte on the Palatine may have been the
defence of the Pons Sublicius and the all-important crossing of the Tiber
(see <ref target="vicus-iugarius" n="U">VICUS IUGARIUS</ref>).</p>
<p>According to Varro (and Pliny (<bibl>NH iii. 66</bibl>), who gives no names), the
Palatine had three gates-the porta Romana, the porta Mugonia and the
porta Ianualis (<bibl>LL. v. 164</bibl>). This last, however, was on the north side
of the forum, and can have had nothing to do with the Palatine (see
<ref target="ianus-geminus" n="U">IANUS GEMINUS</ref>). And if it was founded according to Etruscan ritual,
it should have had three. Most authorities, on the other hand, speak
of only one gate (e.g. <bibl>Liv. i. 12</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">ad veterem portam Palati</foreign>; Ov. Trist.
iii. I. 21). The most probable explanation is that the road which passed
through the porta Mugonia forked, one branch going to the Esquiline
across the Velia, and the other along the north and west slopes of the
Palatine, descending as it went. (clivus Victoriae) to the porta Romana,
which was situated somewhere on this clivus. The Scalae Caci, at the
<pb n="377"/>
foot of which was the third (nameless) gate, formed a footway, avoiding
this long winding road, down to the bottom of the hill. The lower part
of them may well have resembled the stairway described in Whitaker,
Motya, 154-159.</p>
<p>Among the earliest buildings on the Palatine may be mentioned two
archaic cisterns, both constructed in walling of cappellaccio tufa, in
cavities cut in the rock, with an external packing of clay between the
rock and the wall. Both have been cut through and destroyed by later
walls of 2 foot blocks of tufa. One originally had a beehive roof; and
at least one more similar cistern has been found below the ' house of
Livia' (ASA 3). The other is made of thin slabs set on edge, and
is 6 metres in diameter, with steps leading down into it. Four <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth
century</dateRange> vases were found in the clay lining. Lower down is a small
square shrine (?) approached by a flight of steps (which have nothing
to do with the temple of the Magna Mater above), which is possibly the
<ref target="casa-romuli" n="U">CASA ROMULI</ref> (q.v.; cf. TF 105); though it is useless to attempt
an exact identification, its general situation is certain. A little lower
down again is an inhumation tomb, assigned to the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century B.C.</dateRange>,
but found half full of debris of various ages (and therefore tampered with
in ancient times); and below it the native rock has been exposed, and
pole sockets, possibly for huts (and curved cuttings, attributable to the
same purpose), have been found in it. It was asserted that remains of
archaic tombs were discovered, but this interpretation of the results is
now generally rejected. The tufa walls mentioned above have been
interpreted as being retaining walls for raising the level of the whole area
after the fire of <date value="-111">111 B.C.</date>, which destroyed the temple of the Magna Mater,
made of blocks taken from the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century</dateRange> fortifications on each side
of the Scalae Caci (TF 102-107), but this is by no means certain, and some
of them may themselves be part of these fortifications.</p>
<p>The excavations were suspended at this point in 1907 and have
not been carried further down the hill. But it is noticeable that this
group of remains was spared by later constructions. Tiberius, Domitian
and Hadrian all preferred to build enormous substructions out towards
the forum rather than encroach upon this area at the top of the <ref target="scalae-caci" n="U">SCALAE
CACI</ref> (q.v.), sacred to the earliest memorials of the city.

<p>We hear of a number of earlier buildings and sanctuaries on the hill
-the curiae Veteres, the curia Saliorum, the curia Acculeia, the sacella
of Acca Larentia and of Volupia; the shrines and temples of Aius
<pb n="378"/>
Locutius, Dea Viriplaca, Febris, Fides, Fortuna, Iuno Sospita, Luna
Noctiluca, Venus, etc. But the only sanctuaries that scholars can attempt
to localise belong to the later centuries of the republic-<ref target="victoria-aedes" n="U">VICTORIA</ref>,
<ref target="iuppiter-victor" n="U">IUPPITER VICTOR</ref> and <ref target="iuppiter-victor" n="U">MAGNA MATER</ref> (q.v.), and only with regard to the
last has any certainty been attained.</p>
<p>The road system of the Palatine was fundamentally changed by the
buildings of the imperial period; these also blotted out the remains of
the private houses, which, as the Palatine changed its character and
began to come into favour, owing to its position, as a place of residence
for the aristocracy, sprang up all over the hill. The oldest of which
we have any record is that of <ref target="vitruvius-vaccus-domus" n="U">VITRUVIUS VACCUS</ref> (q.v.) in <date value="-330">330 B.C.</date> Later
we hear of that of Cn. Octavius, consul in <date value="-165">165 B.C.</date>, which was bought
by M. SCAURUS for the enlargement of his own house (q.v.); and not far
off was that of Crassus. The house of M. Fulvius Flaccus, consul in
<date value="-125">125 B.C.</date>, on the site of which Q. Lutatius Catulus built a portico, and a
house for himself close to it, must have lain near the north end of the hill;
as also must that of M. Livius Drusus, as well as that of Cicero. Other
important republican houses, such as those of Q. Cicero, Milo, P. Sulla
and Licinius Calvus, were also situated in this part of the Palatine; but
the site of that of Mark Antony cannot be fixed. Nor is it possible to
identify with certainty any of the houses mentioned above with the
remains of republican houses which have been found under the imperial
palaces. (See <bibl>JRS 1913, 242-252</bibl>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the identification of the house of Hortensius,
which later on was bought by Augustus, with that generally known as
the house of Livia is almost certain (see <ref target="augustus-domus-2" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTI</ref>). This house
was left standing up to the end of the classical period, being respected
by the later emperors just as was the house of Romulus. Tiberius, in
building his palace on the north-west summit of the hill (the Cermalus),
did not encroach upon it, and it escaped the fires of Nero <note anchored="true" place="foot"> In regard to this fire, see Leclercq in Cabrol, <bibl>Dict. vii. 481-502</bibl> and reff.
</note> and Titus, and
was similarly spared by Domitian and Hadrian (v. <ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref>).</p>
<p>For the history of the other summit of the hill, upon which Nero
appears to have built a part of the domus Transitoria over the ruins of
republican private houses, while the whole was later remodelled by
Domitian  (to whom  the Palatine owed far more than to any other
emperor), with additions by Septimius Severus, see <ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref>,
<ref target="septizonium-2" n="U">SEPTIZONIUM</ref>.</p>
<p>The transference of the name Palatium first to the imperial palace
on the Palatine and then to any palace is explained as follows by Cass.
Dio:<foreign xml:lang="greek">kalei=tai de\ basi/leia pala/tion...o(/ti e)/n tw=| *palati/w| o( *kai=sar w)/kei ... kai/ tina kai\ pro\s th\n tou= (*rwmu/lou proenoi/khsin fh/mhn h( oi)ki/a au)tou= a)po\ tou= panto\s o)/pous e)/labe</foreign> (liii. 16).</p>
<p>After the Severan period we hear but little of the Palatine, though it
continued to be the imperial residence (Hist. Aug. passim). It is recorded
<pb n="379"/>
both of Elagabalus and of Alexander Severus that they laid pavements of porphyry and Lacedaemonian marble (verde antico) (Hist.
Aug. Elag. 8. 6; 24.6; Alex. Sev. 25. 7), but no remains can be
identified of any of their buildings (HJ 105-107). Nor can we identify
the stable which Carinus decorated with a fresco of a great venatio
(Hist. Aug. Carin. 19. 1), nor the thermae which Maxentius erected
(Chron. 148).</p>
<p>It is clear that in the time of Constantine a considerable part of the
hill was occupied by streets and private buildings (the Notitia gives
20 vici, 89 domus, 2642 (or 2742) insulae) ; and the removal of the imperial
residence to Byzantium meant the beginning of the end. Constantius,
it is true, was '<foreign xml:lang="la">in Palatium receptus</foreign> ' when he visited Rome in <date value="356">356 A.D.</date>
(Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 13). We know very little about the <ref target="forum-palatinum" n="U">FORUM
PALATINUM</ref> (q.v.) which was given to the Roman people by Valentinian
I and his colleagues in <date value="374">374 A.D.</date></p>
<p>The emperors of the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> also resided on the Palatine when
in Rome-Honorius (Claudian, Sext. Cons. Hon. 35), Valentinian III
(Marccll. com. ad a. 434 in Chron. <bibl>Min. ii. 79</bibl>, Aetius (ibid. i. 303;
<bibl>ii. 27</bibl>, 86, 157), Livius Severus (ibid. ii. 158), as well as Odoacer and
Theodoric; the latter restored the Palatine, as well as the walls of the
city, with funds from the arca vinaria (ibid. i. 324), and Cassiodorus, <bibl>Var.

of Theodoric have been found, especially in the hippodromus. It is
surprising that it is never once mentioned by Procopius; though we

also to have removed many of the works of art (see p. 301). In 687,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The story of the crowning of Heraclius on the Palatine in 629 (Chron. Casin. ap.
Muratori, <bibl>RIS ii. 354</bibl>) has rightly been rejected by Gregorovius (ii. 206 of the original
German edition).
</note>
in the sepulchral inscription of <foreign xml:lang="la">Plato v(ir) ill(ustrissimus) cura(tor)
palatii urbis Romae</foreign>, repairs to a long staircase are mentioned, perhaps
that descending from the domus Tiberiana to the forum, in which case
the residence of this Byzantine official was situated there (HJ 110).
Another official, the cartularius, or head of the military archives (who
appears from the history of the seventh and eighth centuries to have
been actually in command of troops), dwelt near the arch of Titus and
the region later (eleventh to thirteenth centuries) known as Palladium
(p. 165); and here the papal archives were later kept, and not in the
mediaeval Turris Cartularia, which took its name from its neighbourhood
to the Cartularium (<bibl>RL 1912, 767-772</bibl>). On the slope above, the great
supporting wall of the platform on which S. Sebastiano stands was
strengthened by a mediaeval fortification wall of uncertain date, which
was, if not built, at least used, by the Frangipani, who occupied the whole
Velia and may have built the tower (ibid. 1909, 527-539; HJ 15-17;
ZA 167, 168).

<p>By this time the lower slopes of the hill had already been occupied
by various churches.  S. Anastasia, at the western angle near the
Lupercal, probably goes back to the <date value="450">middle of the fourth century</date>. It
was erected in imitation of the Holy Place in Bethlehem, and was decorated with paintings by Damasus (Inscr. Chr. ii. i. p. 150) and was the
first of the titular churches, ranking only after the Lateran and S. Maria
Maggiore (<bibl>Mel. 1887, 387-413</bibl>; Grisar, Anal. <bibl>Rom. i. 595</bibl> sqq.; HCh
172-173). Under the church are important remains of six different periods
from republican opus quadratum down to repairs of the time of Theodoric
(HJ 134; ZA  269-274). They have nothing to do with the circus
Maximus, but are remains of arcades belonging to the lower slopes of the
Palatine.</p>
<p>S. Teodoro, on the north-west side, lies well above the classical
level, and is constructed in the second of the three courtyards of the
<ref target="horrea-agrippiana" n="U">HORREA AGRIPPIANA</ref> (q.v.). It is mentioned in the Not. Diacon. of the

<p>The centre of the hill must have been rendered inaccessible by earthquakes, notably by that of the time of Leo IV; and we have practically
no mention of it in the Anonymus Einsiedlensis nor in the Mirabilia.</p>
<p>At the <date value="1500">beginning of the sixteenth century</date>, the Palatine, still called
by its mediaeval name of Palazzo Maggiore, was covered with gardens
and vineyards. Between 1540 and 1550 the whole of the north half
of the hill was bought by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and converted
into a garden. Excavations were made in the state apartments of the
<ref target="augustiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUGUSTIANA</ref> (q.v.) in the <dateRange from="1700" to="1799">eighteenth century</dateRange>; but the site of the
<ref target="tiberiana-domus" n="U">DOMUS TIBERIANA</ref> (q.v.) remained untouched until the excavations of
Rosa for Napoleon III (which cannot have been very thorough) and is
still a beautiful example of a formal garden (<bibl>BA 1914, 369-380</bibl>). The
central portion belonged to the Paolostati family, from whom it paused
successively to the Mattei, Spada, Magnani; then it was bought by Sir
William Gell, but soon passed to Mr. Charles Mills, who built the pseudo-Gothic villa which still bears his name. Later on it became a nunnery.
The Vigna Ronconi occupied the south-east portion, from the Stadium
onwards, in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>; while the south-west portion was in the
hands of the English College until after 1870. The east angle was occupied
by the Vigna Barberini.</p>

was built in <date value="-27">27 B.C.</date>, but Cassius Dio states that it was finished in 25

This passage is not
altogether clear (<bibl>Gilb. iii. 116</bibl>), but it seems probable that the temple
was built for the glorification of the gens Iulia, and that it was dedicated
in particular to Mars and Venus, the most prominent among the
ancestral deities of that family. In the ears of the statue of Venus hung
earrings made of the pieces of Cleopatra's pearls (Plin. <bibl>NH ix. 121</bibl>;
<bibl>Macrob. iii. 17</bibl>. 17). Whether the name refers to the number of deities
honoured in the temple (cf. <foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/nqeion</foreign>, <bibl>Rosch. iii. 1555</bibl>, and the various
<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa/nqeia</foreign> in Greek lands, <bibl>DS iv. 315</bibl>), or means 'very holy' <bibl>(hochheilige,
cf. HJ 582;  Jord. Symbolae  ad  historiam  religionum  Italicarum,
KOnigsberg, Index lectionum, 1883)</bibl>, is uncertain: but Mommsen's
conjecture that the seven niches were occupied by the seven planetary
<pb n="383"/>
deities is attractive, and Hilsen is now in favour of it. There is no
probability in Cassius Dio's second explanation (v. supra).</p>
<p>In the pronaos of Agrippa's building were statues of himself and
Augustus (Cass. Dio loc. cit.), and on the gable were sculptured ornaments of note (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 38</bibl>). The decoration was done by Diogenes
of Athens, and Pliny goes on to say (loc. cit.) <foreign xml:lang="la">in columnis templi eius
Caryatides probantur inter pauca operum (cf. xxxiv. 13: Syracusana
(i.e. aenea) sunt in Pantheo capita columnarum a M. Agrippa posita)</foreign>.
The position of these Caryatides has been much discussed, but is quite
uncertain (Alt. 62-63).</p>
<p>The Pantheon of Agrippa was burned in <date value="80">80 A.D.</date> (Cass. Dio Ixvi. 24. 2)
and restored by Domitian (Chron. 146; Hier. a. Abr. 2105; cf. perhaps
2101). Again, in the reign of Trajan, it was struck by lightning and
burned (<bibl>Oros. vii. 12</bibl>; Hier. a. Abr. 2127). The restoration by Hadrian
(Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19) carried out after 126 (<bibl>AJA 1912, 421</bibl>) was in fact
an entirely new construction, for even the foundations of the existing
building date from that time. The inscription (see above) was probably
placed by Hadrian in accordance with his well-known principle in such
cases. The restoration ascribed to Antoninus Pius (Hist. Aug. Pius 8:<foreign xml:lang="la">instauratum ... templum  Agrippae</foreign>) may refer only to the completion
of Hadrian's building. Finally, a restoration by Severus and Caracalla
in <date value="202">202 A.D.</date> is recorded in the lower inscription on the architrave (<bibl>CIL vi.
896</bibl>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> What it amounted to is quite uncertain, for no traces of their work can be recognised
with any certainty (<bibl>JRS 1925, 125</bibl>).
</note> In January, <date value="59">59 A.D.</date>, the Arval Brethren met in the Pantheon
(<bibl>CIL vi. 2041</bibl>); Hadrian held court in his restored edifice (Cass. <bibl>Dio

<p>The building faces due north; it consists of a huge rotunda preceded
by a pronaos. The former is a drum of brick-faced concrete, in which
numerous brickstamps of the time of Hadrian <note anchored="true" place="foot">'For others, which confirm the date, cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1893, 313</bibl>, 314.

</note> which is 6.20 metres thick; the
structure of it is most complex and well thought out. On the ground
level the amount of solid wall is lessened by seven large niches, alternately
trapezoidal and curved (the place of one of the latter being taken by the
entrance, which faces due north), and by eight void spaces in the masses
of masonry between them, while in the upper story there are chambers
above the niches, also reached by an external gallery supported by the
middle of the three cornices which ran round the dome. In front of
these masses are rectangular projections decorated with columns and
<pb n="384"/>
pediments alternately triangular and curved, which have been converted
into altars. The pavement is composed of slabs of granite, porphyry
and coloured marbles; and so is the facing of the walls of the drum,
which is, however, only preserved as far as the entablature supported by
the columns and pilasters, the facing of the attic having been removed
in 1747 (for drawings, cf. <bibl>NS 1881, 264</bibl>, 292; HJ 585, n. 75).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Add a drawing in Cod. Escurial. f. 30, and another by Raphael (Uffizi 164; Bartoli,
i. lxiv. 99).
</note> The ceiling
of the dome is coffered, and was originally gilded ; in the top of it is a
circular opening surrounded by a cornice in bronze, 9 metres in diameter,
through which light is admitted. The height from it to the pavement
is 43.20 metres (144 feet), the same as the inner diameter of the drum.
The walls are built of brick-faced concrete, with a complicated system of
relieving arches, corresponding to the chambers in the drum, which
extend as far as the second row of coffers of the dome; the method of
construction of the upper portion is somewhat uncertain (the existence
of ribs cannot be proved), but is probably of horizontal courses of bricks
gradually inclined inwards. Pumice stone is used in the core for the sake
of increased lightness.</p>
<p>The ancient bronze doors are still preserved, though they were repaired
in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>. The pronaos is rectangular, 34 metres wide
and 13.60 deep, and has three rows of Corinthian columns, eight of grey
granite in the front row and four of red granite in each of the second and
third. Of those which were missing at the east end (which cannot possibly
have been removed in <date value="1545">1545</date> (DAP 2. xv. 373, 374), as they were already
absent earlier (compare <bibl>Heemskerck i. 10</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 21</bibl>; Giovannoli, Roma
Antica <bibl>(1615)</bibl>, ii. 11), the corner column was replaced by Urban VIII
with a column of red granite, and the other two by Alexander VII, with
grey columns from the thermae Alexandrinae.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The corner column only lacked the capital, and why it was removed by Urban VIII
is not clear. The capital bears his badge (the Barberini bee) just as the other two capitals
bear the Chigi star of Alexander VII. See <bibl>Roma v. (1927) 471</bibl>.
</note> The columns support a
triangular pediment, in the field of which were bronze decorations; in
the frieze is the inscription of Agrippa; and the roof of the portico
behind was supported by bronze trusses. This portico was not built after
the rotunda, as recent investigations by Colini and Gismondi have shown
(<bibl>BC 1926, 67-92</bibl>), and the capitals of its columns are exactly like those of
the interior (RA 122), though the entasis of the columns differs (Mem.
Am. <bibl>Acad. iv. 122</bibl>, 142). In front of it was an open space surrounded by
colonnades. The hall at the back belongs also to Hadrian's time, and
so do the constructions on the east in their first form. The exterior of
the drum was therefore hardly seen in ancient times.</p>
<p>The podium  of the earlier structure, built by Agrippa, lies about
2.50 metres below the pavement of the later portico; it was rectangular,
43.76 metres wide and 19.82 deep, and faced south, so that the front
line of columns of the latter rests on its back wall, while the position of
<pb n="385"/>
the doorways of the two buildings almost coincides. To the south of the
earlier building was a pronaos 21.26 metres wide, so that the plan was
similar to that of the temple of Concord.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> In this case there would be no room for the decastyle portico which some suppose
(cf. SScR 71-73, who conjectures that it is represented in the well-known relief of a
decastyle temple (HF 1146, 1412; cf. <bibl>PBS iv. 247</bibl>; see <ref target="venus-et-roma-templum" n="U">VENUS ET ROMA, TEMPLUM</ref>)).
Chedanne, however, whose results are not yet published, thought that the entablature
of the pronaos had originally belonged to a decastyle temple, which he supposed to have
been peripteral (HJ 589).
</note> At 2.15 metres below the
pavement of the rotunda there was an earlier marble pavement, which
probably belonged to an open area in front of the earlier structure; <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The wall of opus reticulatum which was found to be concentric with the drum of the
rotunda may have been an enclosure wall, or may have served as part of the foundations
of the drum; but the former is more likely, as it was about 2 feet high, with a rounded
top like a garden wall. Whether the slope of the earlier pavement from the centre towards
the circumference was due to design or to the weight of the later rotunda, is doubtful.
</note>
but a marble pavement of an intermediate period (perhaps that of
Domitian) was also found actually above this earlier structure, but below
the marble pavement of the pronaos.</p>
<p>The restoration of Severus and Caracalla has been already mentioned;
but after it, except for the account by Ammianus Marcellinus, already
cited, of Constantius' visit to it, we hear nothing <note anchored="true" place="foot"> There is a mention of it in Cod. <bibl>Theod. xiiii. 3</bibl>. 10, lecta in Pantheo non. Nov. (<date value="368">368</date>

and it was only Gregory III who placed a lead roof over it (ib. xcii. 12).
That the pine-cone of the Vatican came from the Pantheon is a mediaeval
fable; it was a fountain perhaps connected with the <ref target="serapeum" n="U">SERAPEUM</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>The description of it by Magister Gregorius in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange>
(<bibl>JRS 1919, 36-37</bibl>, 53) is interesting, especially for the mention of the
sarcophagi, baths and figures which stood in front of the portico (cf.
DuP 131 for further information as to its history in the Renaissance,
during which it was a continual subject of study for artists and architects).
A porphyry urn (from the thermae of Agrippa), added by Leo X, now
serves as the sarcophagus of Clement XII in the Lateran. For its mediaeval decoration, see <bibl>BCr 1912, 25</bibl>.</p>
<p>Martin V repaired the lead roof (<bibl>LPD ii. 544</bibl>) and Nicholas V did the

<p> the temple of Peace
which was begun by Vespasian after the capture of Jerusalem in <date value="71">71 A.D.</date>,
and dedicated in <date value="75">75</date> (Suet. Vesp. 9; Joseph. b. <bibl>Iud. vii. 5</bibl>. 7 (158) ; Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxv. 15</bibl>.   ; Aur. Vict. Caes. 9. 7; Ep. 9. 8). It stood in the middle of
the forum Pacis, north of the basilica Aemilia (<bibl>Mart. i. 2</bibl>. 8), probably
at the junction of the modern Vie Alessandrina and dei Pozzi. Statius
seems to ascribe the completion of this temple to Domitian (<bibl>Silv. iv. 3</bibl>. 17;
cf. iv. I. 13), but this emperor's claim may have had little foundation
(cf. Suet. Dom. 5). Within the temple, or attached closely to it, was a
library, bibliotheca Pacis (<bibl>Gell. v. 21</bibl>. 9; <bibl>xvi. 8</bibl>. 2; Boyd, 16-17, 36-37).
In it were placed many of the treasures brought by Vespasian from
Jerusalem, as well as famous works of Greek artists (Joseph. b. <bibl>Iud.
vii. 5</bibl>. 7; Plin. <bibl>NH xii. 94</bibl>; <bibl>xxxiv. 84</bibl>; <bibl>xxxv. 102</bibl>, 109; <bibl>xxxvi. 27</bibl>,

and Pliny (<bibl>NH xxxvi. 102</bibl>) speaks of it, the basilica Aemilia and the
forum of Augustus, as the three most beautiful monuments in Rome.</p>
<p>Just before the death of Commodus, probably in 191, the temple was
destroyed by fire (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxii. 24</bibl>. I; Galen, de comp. med. i. I), <note anchored="true" place="foot"> xiii. 362, ed. Kiihn.
</note>
but it must have been restored, probably by Severus, for it is mentioned
in the succeeding centuries as one of the most magnificent buildings
in the city (<bibl>Herod. i. 14</bibl>. 2; Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 14; Hist. Aug.
trig. tyr. 31. 10). It gave its name to the fourth region of the city (Not.
Reg. IV). In 408 there were seismic disturbances for seven successive
days in the forum Pacis (Marcell. Comes, Chron. min. ed. Mommsen
<pb n="387"/>
ii. 69:<foreign xml:lang="la"> in foro Pacis per dies septem terra mugitum dedit</foreign>), and the
temple may have been injured then.  At any rate Procopius (<bibl>BG
iv. 21</bibl>), writing in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange>, says that it had long since been
destroyed by lightning, although there were still many works of art set
up in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>The enclosure within which the temple stood is not called forum
in literature until after the time of Constantine. Enclosure and temple
together appear in Pliny (xxxvi. 27) as Pacis opera, and in the Greek
writers as<foreign xml:lang="greek">te/menos *ei)rh/nhs</foreign>(see above).  Forum  Pacis is found in
Ammianus, Polemius Silvius and Marcellinus Comes (locc. citt.),<foreign xml:lang="greek">fo/ron *ei)rh/nhs</foreign>in Procopius (loc. cit.); forum Vespasiani first in Ep. de Eulalio
antipapa a. 418 (ap. <bibl>Migne xviii. 397</bibl>), Polemius Silvius (loc. cit.), and
undoubtedly in Aurelius Victor (Caes. 9. 7). On the north-west it
adjoined the (later) forum Transitorium, and on the south-east the
basilica of Constantine, being rectangular in shape with the same orientation as the other imperial fora. Its length was 145 metres, and its width
about two-thirds as much, although its north-east boundary is uncertain.
It had an enclosing wall of peperino lined with marble and pierced with
several gates. The peperino blocks have left impressions on the concrete
of the basilica of Constantine, the north-west side of which was set
against it. At the south-east corner there was an entrance from the
Sacra via through a monumental passage which, after several changes,
is now the church of SS. Cosma e Damiano.  (For the history and description of this building, and the theory that it was the Urbis fanum,
mentioned by Aurelius Victor (40. 26) as built by Maxentius and consecrated to Constantine, and  not the	templum	divi Romuli, see
P. Whitehead, <bibl>BCr 1913, 143-165</bibl>; <bibl>YW	1913, 21</bibl>.)	Further investigations have led him to the conclusion that the rectangular building in opus
quadratum <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Others hold it to be the bibliotheca Pacis (HJ 4-6; HFP 48).
</note> was the temple of the Penates as restored by Augustus
(<bibl>AJA 1923, 414</bibl>; <bibl>1927, 1-18</bibl>; RPAiii.83-95). In the time of Severus a wall

from which street the temple was probably reached by the scalae deum
Penatium mentioned by Varro (ap. Donat. loc. cit.). There is no record
of its building, but it is first mentioned in the list of Argei (<bibl>Varro v. 54</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">Veliense sexticeps in Velia apud aedem deum Penatium</foreign>) of the <dateRange from="150" to="199">second

<p>This temple is sometimes thought to have been removed by Vespasian
when he built the forum Pacis (see <ref target="pax-templum" n="U">PACIS TEMPLUM</ref>), sometimes to have
occupied the site of the so-called ' templum Romuli ' (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 416-417 ;
<bibl>Rosch. iii. 1889-1890</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 81-84</bibl>, where the identification of this
temple with the actual rotunda is ridiculous; WR 165). But, according
to the most recent theory, the rectangular building which forms the main
part of the church of SS. Cosma e Damiano is the enclosure wall of the
temple of the Penates as restored by Augustus (<bibl>AJA 1923, 414</bibl>), which
is hidden under the church.</p>
<p>The brick wall at the back, which served to carry the forma Urbis
(see <ref target="pax-templum" n="U">PAX, TEMPLUM</ref>), is, in its present condition, even later than Septimius
Severus: while the rotunda belongs to the time of Maxentius (see URBIS
FANUM).  The whole subject has been carefully studied by Whitehead
and Biasiotti (<bibl>RPA iii. 83-122</bibl>; <bibl>AJA 1927, 1-18</bibl>; cf. also Leclercq in

close to the ancient porta Salutaris. The Petronia stream probably
followed the line of the present underground channel which runs south-
west across the Piazza Venezia, and westward to the east end of the

after uniting with the <ref target="aqua-sallustiana" n="U">AQUA SALLUSTIANA</ref> (q.v.) it turned south and

the navalia (<bibl>AR 1909, 67-76</bibl>), is as yet undetermined. The importance
of this stream lay in the fact that it was the boundary of the city auspices,
and necessitated the taking of the auspicia peremnia whenever the

the vicus piscinae Publicae (<bibl>CIL vi. 975</bibl>; Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvii. 4</bibl>. 14),
which led from the south end of the circus Maximus across the depression

probably fed by local springs, not by the aqua Appia (LA 234-245 ; cf.

bounded on the north-east by the via Appia, on the south-east by a

<p> the boundary line of the site destined for a city, which site,
according to the rules of augural procedure, was inaugurated as a templum,
or rectangular area, within which auspices could be taken, marked off
from the ager publicus by a line of stones at regular intervals. The
formal founding of a city is thus described by Varro (<bibl>LL v. 143</bibl>):<foreign xml:lang="la"> oppida
condebant in Latio Etrusco ritu multi, id est iunctis bobus, tauro
et vacca, interiore aratro circumagebant sulcum (hoc faciebant religionis
causa die auspicato), ut fossa et muro essent muniti. terram  unde
exculpserant, fossam vocabant et introrsus iactam  murum; post ea
qui fiebat orbis, urbis principium, qui quod erat post murum, postmoerium  dictum, eoque auspicia urbana finiuntur.</foreign>  Thus the furrow
represented the moat; and the earth thrown up by the plough, the wall
of the city. The line urbis principium or pomerium, behind (i.e. within)
the murus, marked the limit of the inaugurated district within which
auspices could be taken. The word pomerium was soon transferred to
the strip of land between this line and the actual city wall, and was then
used in both senses (<bibl>Dionys. i. 88</bibl>); while at a later period it seems
to have been still further extended in application and to have been
incorrectly used of the strip on both sides of the wall (<bibl>Liv. i. 44</bibl>).</p>
<p>In Rome the first pomerium is that of the Palatine city, the wall of
which must have been built on the slope of the hill; but its line can
only be a matter of conjecture, and that which Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>)
<pb n="393"/>
describes as marked out by Romulus (<foreign xml:lang="la">a foro boario . . . sulcus designandi

by the Luperci in his day. It does not agree with Varro ap. <bibl>Solin. i. 17</bibl>
(cf. <ref target="roma-quadrata-1" n="U">ROMA QUADRATA (1)</ref>). At three points in the circuit, the plough
was carefully lifted up, and carried for a few feet. These breaks in the
furrowmarked the position of the three gates required for everysettlement
by Etruscan ritual (Varro cit. 142; Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. i. 422</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys.

<p>The successive stages in the growth of the city (see <ref target="septimontium" n="U">SEPTIMONTIUM,
REGIONES QUATTUOR</ref>) mark corresponding enlargements of its pomerium,
but when the Servian wall was constructed the line of the pomerium
was not extended to coincide with it, but remained as it had been during
the previous period, the Esquiline remaining outside it (for the Aventine,
which was probably not included within the wall until after <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date>,
see <bibl>CP 1909, 420-432</bibl>). And so it remained until the time of Sulla.
He was the first Roman to extend the pomerium, and he based his action
on this principle (<bibl>Gell. xiii. 14</bibl>. 3):<foreign xml:lang="la"> habebat autem ius proferendi pomerii
qui populum Romanum agro de hostibus capto auxerat</foreign>. In his time this
referred to territory in Italy (Sen. de brev. vit. 13; Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsrecht
ii. 738</bibl>), but later it was expanded to cover the ager barbaricus (Hist. Aug.
Aurel. 21). Of Sulla's extension nothing is known, nor of similar action
ascribed to Julius Caesar (Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 50</bibl>), Augustus (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xii. 23</bibl>;
Cass. <bibl>Dio v. 6</bibl>), Nero, Trajan and Aurelian (Hist. Aug. Aurel. 21).</p>
<p>A recent attempt has been made (<bibl>BC 1919, 24-32</bibl>) by Laffranchi to
show that Augustus' extension of the pomerium  occurred thrice, in
<date value="-27">27</date>, <date value="-18">18</date> and <date value="-8">8 B.C.</date>, from an examination of his coins. Those used as
evidence are Cohen, Aug. 114, 116, 117 (not 177); Babelon, Iulia 153,
155, 156; BM. Imp. i. p. 102, Nos. 628-630; 104, Nos. 637-642; cf.
p. 29.</p>
<p>An extension by Claudius in <date value="49">49 A.D.</date> is proved by unimpeachable
literary testimony (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>; <bibl>Gell. xiii. 14</bibl>. 7) and by the discovery
of inscribed terminal cippi. These rectangular cippi bear on the top
the word Pomerium, on the front the inscription recording the fact of
the extension, and on the left side the number of the stone. This number
is found on four of the eight cippi so far discovered; on the others it has
been obliterated or was never cut.</p>
<p>The numbered cippi are:</p>
<p>(a) <bibl>CIL vi. 31537</bibl> a, found in situ south-east of monte Testaccio,
with the number viii. (d in text fig. 4).
<pb n="394"/></p>
<p>(b) <bibl>CIL vi. 1231</bibl> b=31537 b, found near the porta Metrovia inside
the Aurelian wall, probably not far from its original site, with the
number xxxv. (c in text fig. 4).</p>
<p>(c) <bibl>NS 1909, 45</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1909, 130</bibl>, found in situ about 70 metres west
of the Via Salaria and about 400 north of the Porta Salaria, with the
number ciix. (x in text fig. 4).</p>
<p>(d) <bibl>NS 1913, 68</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1913, 67</bibl>; <bibl>AJA  1914, 400</bibl>, found in situ
32.50 metres west of the Via Flaminia and 330 metres north of the
Porta del Popolo, with the number cxxxix.</p>
<p>The unnumbered cippi are:</p>
<p>(e) <bibl>NS 1909, 44</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1909, 132</bibl>, a fragment found close to the Tre
Archi, where the railway lines pass through the Aurelian wall north
of the Porta Maggiore. This cippus was probably very near its original
site.</p>
<p>f) <bibl>CIL vi. 1231</bibl> c=31537 c, found in 1738 in the Vigna Nari outside
the Porta Salaria, very near (c). It was not reported as found in situ.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> b in text fig. 4.</note>
<pb n="395"/></p>
<p>(g) CIL vi. l231 a=31537 d, found in the campus Martius near
S. Lucia della Chiavica, not absolutely in situ, but probably not far
removed from its proper place (a in text fig. 4).</p>
<p>(h) <bibl>NS 1912, 197</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1912, 259-260</bibl>; <bibl>AJA 1913, 444</bibl>: another
cippus corresponding in form to those of Claudius but without any
inscription except the word pomerium on the top, found under the
new Palazzo delle Ferrovie, at the corner of the Viale del Policlinico,
just outside the Porta Pia, not exactly in situ.</p>
<p>If we suppose that the line began at the river south of the Aventine,
where the Aurelian wall afterwards commenced, the distance to (a),
marked viii, is approximately 570 metres, almost exactly eight times
71 (568). 71 metres equal 240 Roman feet, the bini actus, which
was the length of the long side of a iugerum, the distance between the
openings in the specus of the aqueducts (<bibl>Vitruv. viii. 6</bibl>. 3), and the
distance between their terminal cippi, so that it is quite probable that
the cippi of the pomerium were at the same distance apart. From (a)
to (b), marked viii and xxxv, is about 1920 metres, which again nearly
equals 71x27 <bibl>(1917)</bibl>; and from (c) to (d), ciix and cxxxix, the distance
might easily be made about 2201 metres, that is, 71 x31.  If this line
continued to the Tiber directly from (d), about 300 metres, there would
have been three or four more cippi, 142 or 143 in all (<bibl>BC 1913, 68-70</bibl>).
Further, if the pomerium passing through these four numbered points
followed in general the line afterwards taken by the Aurelian wall,
leaving out such projections as that made by the wall south of the baths
of Caracalla, (e) would naturally fall into it, and (f) and (h) might be
supposed to have been moved somewhat from  their proper places.
The line on the western side of the city is, however, entirely uncertain,
for (g) is probably near its original position, and the Iseum and the
porticus Octaviae were outside the pomerium in the time of Tiberius
(Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 8</bibl>), and when Vespasian celebrated his triumph in <date value="71">71 A.D.</date>
(Josephus, Bell. <bibl>Iud. vii. 5</bibl>. 4 (123 sqq.).</p>
<p>Vespasian also extended the pomerium. Permission was given him
in the lex de imperio (<bibl>CIL vi. 930</bibl>, 14-16), and three inscribed cippi of
his line have been found (e, f, g in text fig. 4):</p>
<p>(i) <bibl>CIL vi. 31538</bibl> a; <bibl>BC 1882, 154</bibl>, found about 1540-1550 outside
the porta Pinciana with the number xxxi. The original is lost and
its exact position cannot now be determined, but it was probably
about 150 metres in a west-north-west direction from the gate (<bibl>Hermes
1887, 621-622</bibl>).</p>
<p>(k) <bibl>CIL vi. 1232</bibl>=31538 b=<bibl>NS 1886, 232</bibl>, found in 1856 near the
porta Ostiensis, just inside the Aurelian wall and 60 metres from (a),
with the number XLVII on its left side and P. CCCXLVII on the right.</p>
<p>(m) <bibl>CIL vi. 31538</bibl>C; <bibl>NS 1900, 15-17</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1899, 270-279</bibl>, found
under the church of S. Cecilia in Trastevere, built into a late wall and
probably not in its original position. This cippus has no number, and
<pb n="360"/>
the face where the distance to the next stone was inscribed has been
broken off.</p>
<p>The termination of Trajan is thought to be recorded in a coin of 107 (?)
(Cohen, Trajan 539), which was restored in two contorniates (<bibl>BC 1919, 35-38</bibl>).</p>
<p>Under Hadrian in <date value="121">121 A.D.</date> the line was again marked out, and four
of his cippi have been found, but they record a restoration and not an
extension:</p>
<p>(n) <bibl>CIL vi. 1233</bibl> a=31539 a; <bibl>NS 1887, 18</bibl> ; <bibl>BC 1887, 149</bibl>, found
in <date value="1867">1867</date> under No. 18 Piazza Sforza Cesarini, with the number vi on
the left side and P. CCCCLXXX on the right (h in text fig. 4).</p>
<p>(o) <bibl>CIL vi. 31539</bibl> b, found in 1732 or 1735 in the foundations of
a wall near S. Stefano del Cacco (i in text fig. 4).</p>
<p>(p) <bibl>CIL vi. 1233</bibl> b=31539 c, copied in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> " ante
domum Caesiam," which gives no evidence of its original locality.</p>
<p>(q) There seems to be good reason for accepting the account of
Ligorio (<bibl>Taur. xv. 205</bibl>) of the discovery of a cippus near the so-called
Porta Chiusa (marked Porta (?), just south of the Castra Praetoria in
textfig. 4); the text is identical with that of <bibl>CIL vi. 31539</bibl> a (<bibl>LS ii. 248</bibl>).

<p>A comparison of the cippi thus far found seems to justify certain
conclusions:</p>
<p>(I) that north of the Pincian the pomerium of the empire lay somewhat beyond the line of the Aurelian wall; (2) that the <rs key="regio13" type="region">thirteenth</rs>, and
most of the <rs key="regio12" type="region">twelfth</rs>, region of Augustus lay within it; (3) that at some
points (cf. (b), (e), (h) ) pomerium and wall coincided ; (4) that, whatever
may have been the case with the line of Claudius (see above), the pomerium
of Vespasian and Hadrian crossed the campus Martius approximately
from the ara Ditis to the south end of the Saepta (cf. (n), (o) ), and that
the part of the campus north of this line was outside the pomerium;
(5) that the discovery of one stone (m) does not, under the circumstances,
make it probable that Vespasian extended the pomerium  across the
Tiber; (6) that the distances from the next cippi which are indicated
on two stones (k, n), and the inscribed numbers do not afford sufficient
data to enable us to draw the rest of the line except possibly for part
of that of Claudius.</p>

a bronze medallion of Hadrian  which  is accepted  as genuine by

called pons Hadriani (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19; Prud. <bibl>Peristeph. xii. 6</bibl> ;
Mirab. Il; Pol. Silv. 545; Ordo Bened. pass.), and in the Middle
Ages Pons S. Petri (Anon. Magi. 158; Eins. pass.; Jord. i. I. 416).
It had three main arches 18.39 metres in diameter, with three smaller
arches on the left, 3, 3.5 and 7.59 metres in diameter respectively, and
two on the right, 7.59 and 3.75 in diameter. From the central part,
over the main arches, the bridge sloped down at an angle of 15 degrees, and
the approach on the left side was by a long ramp. The total width was
10.95 metres, and the material travertine with peperino between the
arches. The inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 973</bibl>) was seen, probably on the parapet,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Mr. S. R. Pierce informs me that he has noticed a few letters of a large inscription on the

in 1375 (<bibl>Mitt. 1893, 321-323</bibl>), so that apparently this bridge suffered no
great injury until December 1450, when the parapet was broken by the
throngs of pilgrims, and restored by Nicholas V. In 1527 the statues
of S. Peter and S. Paul were erected by Clement VII, and in 1669-71
Clement IX  placed on the parapet the famous statues representing
angels (Mem. A.P. i. I. 224). Two of the arches on the left side had
become covered up, but the structure remained intact until the building
of the present embankment in 1892 necessitated the reconstruction of
the ends of the bridge, so that only the three central arches are now
standing.</p>

Aethicus, Cosmog. 28 (ed. Riese 83) ) indicates that this bridge was close
to the pons Sublicius and crossed the river from the forum Boarium
(cf. CIL i². p. 325). According to Livy (xl. 51. 4) M. Fulvius Nobilior

the hypothesis that the fornices of 142 were of wood and that the stone

arches were laid by a later Aemilius in his quaestorship.  That the

<foreign xml:lang="la">pontis maximi tectum  cum  columnis in Tiberim  deiectum</foreign>, is cited as
evidence that pons maximus was then a name in common use, although
Mommsen's conjecture pontificis may be correct.</p>
<p>In the <dateRange from="1300" to="1399">fourteenth century</dateRange> an arch was standing in the forum Boarium
in front of the Ponte Rotto described as arcus marmoreus in platea
pontis S. Mariae (Anon. Magl. 155), on which was an inscription (<bibl>CIL
vi. 878</bibl>) referring to a restoration by Augustus after <date value="-12">12 B.C.</date> It is possible
that this restoration may have been that of the bridge. Besides pons S.
Mariae (<bibl>LS ii. 22-28</bibl>; <bibl>iv. 49</bibl>, 84) this bridge was called in the Middle
Ages pons Senatorum  (Mirab. II), and pons Maior (Eins. 7. 4; cf.
Delbruck, Hellenistische <bibl>Bauten i. 14</bibl>). In the <dateRange from="600" to="699">seventh century</dateRange> Aethicus
(loc. cit.) writes: <foreign xml:lang="la">pontem Lepidi qui nunc abusive a plebe lapideus
dicitur iuxta forum boarium transiens</foreign>. Both these early variants of
Aemilius are easily explained, Lepidi from Aemilius, and lapideus from
the tradition that it was the first stone bridge (Plut. loc. cit.). The
identification of the pons Aemilius of the empire with the present Ponte
Rotto may be regarded as certain. This bridge was partially destroyed
by the flood of 1557 (cf. M61. 1906, 189-193) and repaired by Gregory XIII
(III. 37). In 1598 the eastern half was carried away, and in 1887 two of
the three remaining arches were removed, so that only one now stands
in midstream. Recent investigation has shown that the ancient pier
of this arch is not the earliest, as the remains of the abutment are earlier
and belong to a bridge slightly further north which crossed the river
at a slightly different angle. This was therefore the bridge of the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second
century B.C.</dateRange> and the existing arch and pier belong to a second structure,
probably that of Augustus (Delbrfick, op. cit. i. 12-22 ; ii. taf. 2 ; Richter,

pons ruptus vulgariter nominatus et tremulus et Antoninus</foreign> (Anon. Magl.
158, Urlichs). This was partially destroyed in 772, hence the name
ruptus, and rebuilt in 1475 in its present shape by Sixtus IV, from whom
comes its modern name, Ponte Sisto. The start of the first arch of the
older bridge may still be seen. If this identification be correct, the
bridge must have been built by an emperor who bore both names,
Marcus Aurelius or Caracalla, and perhaps by the latter rather than the
former, as he could thus bring the buildings of Severus (Hist. Aug. Sev.
19) into closer connection with the campus Martius.</p>
<p>In 1878, in the river immediately below the first arch of the Ponte
Sisto, were found remains of an earlier bridge and also of a memorial
arch which stood at its entrance (<bibl>BC 1878, 241</bibl>; <bibl>1881, 11</bibl>; cf. <bibl>NS 1892,
50</bibl>, 234-235; <bibl>Mitt. 1911, 238-259</bibl>). On some of these remains are
fragmentary inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 31402-31412</bibl>; ILS 769) which record
the rebuilding of arch and bridge by Valentinian I in <dateRange from="365" to="366">365-366 A.D.</dateRange>
Some pieces of bronze statues were also found (PT 179, 195, 197). This
proves that the pons Antoninus was restored by Valentinian, and explains
a reference in Ammianus (xxvii. 3. 3). The name, pons Valentinianus,
must have been in use to some extent in later times, together with the
earlier, for in the Mirabilia (II) both names are found, although, by an
error, they are used of different bridges. It is apparent that the impression made on the Romans by the rebuilding of Valentinian was not strong
enough to cause the displacement of the earlier names, pons Antoninus,
pons Aurelius, by the new official designation (Jord. i. I. 417-420;
<bibl>ii. 192-195</bibl>, 436; Mayerhofer, Gesch.-Topograph. Studien 44-46,  14;

was 48 metres long and 8.20 wide, with one central arch, 23.65 metres
in span, and a small arch on each side, 5.80 metres wide. The material
was tufa and peperino with facing of travertine, and the pedestals of
the parapet probably supported statues of the emperors as those of the
pons Fabricius did hermae.  The construction was rough and characteristic of the decadence, and very little of the earlier pons Cestius could
have survived in the later structure, although the general appearance and
form of the two bridges were doubtless about the same.</p>
<p>The pons Gratiani was restored at various times between the <dateRange from="1100" to="1834">twelfth
century and 1834</dateRange>, but in <dateRange from="1888" to="1892">1888-1892</dateRange> the building of the new embankment
and the widening of the channel made it necessary to take down the
old bridge and erect a new one, 80.40 metres long, with three arches.
The central arch of the new structure reproduces the original exactly,
although only about one-third of the old material could be used again
(Jord. i. I. 418-420; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 282-285</bibl>; Besnier 106-119, and literature

It is probable that this stone bridge replaced an earlier one of wood.
In the Middle Ages it was known both by its official name (Not. app.;
Pol. Silv. 545; Mirab. II) and as the pons Iudaeorum  (Graphia 10)
because it was close to the Ghetto.</p>
<p>This is the best preserved bridge in Rome, being practically the
original structure. It is built of tufa and peperino faced with travertine,
part of which has been replaced with brick, and has two semi-circular
arches with a smaller one between. The bridge is 62 metres long, and
the arches are 24.25 and 24.50 metres wide. The present parapet was
constructed in 1679 by Innocent XI, but the original was divided into
panels by pilasters supporting four-faced hermae and connected by a
bronze balustrade. The two pilasters and hermae at the east end are
original, and from them the modern name of the bridge, Ponte dei Quattro
Capi, is derived (Jord. i. I. 418-419; HJ 632; <bibl>Mitt. 1891, 135</bibl> ; Besnier

<p>It is now generally identified with a still later bridge, which crossed
the Tiber a little south of the north corner of the Aventine, and was called
in the Middle Ages pons marmoreus Theodosii (Mirab. II) and pons

Symmachus (<bibl>Ep. iv. 70</bibl>; <bibl>v. 76</bibl>; Relat. 25, 26) it appears that work was
begun on this bridge before 384 but not completed in 387, and while the
structure is called novus, it is usually believed to have been a rebuilding
of the pons Probi. This bridge was partially destroyed in the <dateRange from="1000" to="1099">eleventh

was constructed of wood without metal of any sort whatsoever (Plut.

preservation was a matter of religion, and any injury caused by floods
was regarded as a prodigium.  Such injuries seem  to have been not
infrequent (Cass. <bibl>Dio xxxvii. 58</bibl>; 1. 8; <bibl>liii. 33</bibl>; Iv. 22), but the bridge
was always repaired and was standing as late as the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> (Hist.
Aug. Ant. Pii 8; Not. app.; Mythol. <bibl>Vat. i. 74</bibl>). It is represented on
a coin of Antoninus (Cohen, Ant. Pius No. 127) with the contest of
Romans and Etruscans, and Horatius swimming in the river. There is
no doubt about the antiquity of the bridge, and its method of construction
is generally regarded as evidence that it dated from the period before the
inhabitants of Latium had developed the working of iron far enough for
use in bridge building, a period that may perhaps correspond to the
second stage in the growth of the city when it spread out beyond the
limits of the Palatine (<bibl>Mitt. 1895, 160-162</bibl>). It is possible that iron was
not used simply that it might be easier to pull down the structure when
danger threatened from  the Etruscan side (cf. the story of Horatius,
<bibl>Liv. ii. 19</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. v. 22</bibl>; Stuart Jones, Companion 76).</p>
<p>The position of the pons Sublicius has been the subject of much
dispute, for the passages in ancient literature, describing its defence by
Horatius and the flight of Gaius Gracchus (<bibl>Liv. ii. 10</bibl>. 7; <bibl>v. 40</bibl>; Val.
Max. i. I. 10; <bibl>iii. 2</bibl>; <bibl>iv. 7</bibl>. 2; de vir. ill. 65; Plut. Gracch. 17; App.
<bibl>BC i. 2</bibl>. 6 and 58), merely represent it as the ordinary and shortest way
from the left bank to the Janiculum. The strongest evidence indicates
that it crossed from  the forum  Boarium  just below  the later pons
Aemilius, the only point where its approach would have been protected
by the city wall: and in this case it would have been built in the slack
water just below the island, where the original ford was probably situated
(see <ref target="vicus-iugarius" n="U">VICUS IUGARIUS</ref>).</p>

name is still given correctly in the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> by Magister Gregorius

<p>It is mentioned frequently during the Middle Ages under several
variant names, corruptions of Appia (T ix. 32.35). The existing structure
dates for the most part from the rebuilding of Honorius, with various
later additions (Jord. i. I. 366; <bibl>LS ii. 59</bibl> ; Reber 538). The lowest part
consists of an arch, flanked by square towers, faced with marble blocks
that were evidently taken from other buildings, perhaps in part from
the neighbouring temple of MARS (q.v.). Both the porta Appia and the
porta Flaminia originally had double arches of blocks of travertine,
divided by a central pier (as in the porta Portuensis), traces of which may
be seen on the right going out), and semi-circular brick towers (ZA 317;
Town Planning Review xi. <bibl>(1924)</bibl>, 76-79; Richmond in Discovery vi.
<bibl>(1925)</bibl>, 293-295). Almost semicircular towers succeeded these: then
came the rectangular bastions faced with white marble blocks (with
circular bosses upon them, the object of which is uncertain <note anchored="true" place="foot"> ZA 318-319 suggests an explanation.
</note>) which were
probably added by Honorius, and the tombs of the via Appia were,
no doubt, pillaged, just as were those of the via Flaminia.  There
is a simple cornice around the whole structure, and on the keystone
of the arch is cut the monogram of Christ and three inscriptions in
Greek--<foreign xml:lang="greek">*qeou= xa/ris, a(/gie *gewrgi/</foreign>. Above this marble structure
is another of brick and tufa faced concrete which continues the square
towers below, and which, like the lower part, has been rebuilt or refaced
at least once. The curtain over the arch is pierced with two rows of
seven small arches each, now walled up, that open into chambers within.
Above the top of this part, again, the towers rise in almost circular form
to a height of two stories, with rows of five windows in each story. The
height of the towers is about 28 metres, and they, as well as the central
portion, are surmounted with crenellated battlements (ZA 316-319;
cf. Ephemeris Dacico-Romana, i. <bibl>(1923)</bibl> 3, 4). In one of the later restorations the <ref target="arcus-drusi-1" n="U">ARCO DI DRUSO</ref> (q.v.) was made to serve as the entrance to a

porta Naevia of the Servian wall passes through the part of the wall which
was destroyed by the erection of the bastione di Sangallo in 1538, and there
are indications in the architect's drawings of a small gate at this point.
Whether it was like the other principal gates or merely a postern
(posterula) is uncertain. Poggio says that it had an inscription of Honorius
upon it, but no copy is known (Jord. i. I. 367; <bibl>Mitt. 1894, 320-327</bibl>;

<p> a gate in the Aurelian wall on the Caelian, just south-west
of the Porta S. Giovanni (Ill. 42), through which the <ref target="via-asinaria" n="U">VIA ASINARIA</ref> (q.v.)
passed (DMH; Procop. <bibl>BG i. 14</bibl>. 14; <bibl>iii. 20</bibl>. 15). This road was of no
importance, and the massiveness of the gate may be due to the vicinity
of the Lateran palace. The name is given correctly by Magister Gregorius
(<bibl>JRS 1919, 19</bibl>, 46); by other writers of the Middle Ages it was called
Porta Asinaria Lateranensis (Mirab. 4) and Porta S. Johannis (GMU 88;
R ii. 406, who distorts the ancient name into Assenarica). It was closed
in 1408, but probably opened again, and not permanently closed until the
modern Porta S. Giovanni was built in <date value="1574">1574</date>.</p>
<p>The existing structure of brick-faced concrete is not later than
Honorius. It shows traces of several changes of plan or additions in
the same material, and is one of the best preserved of all the gates. It has
two long bastions with semicircular fronts and three rows of windows,
and these bastions are flanked by square staircase towers: and above
the archway is the usual long chamber in the masonry with two rows
of windows, of which the lower interrupts an earlier embattled breastwork
(Jord. i. I. 363; <bibl>RE ii. 158</bibl> ; <bibl>PBSR iv. 42-43</bibl>; Reber 535-536; T ii.

this name in DMH (<date value="403">403 A.D.</date>) and also in Eins. I.1 ; 2.1 ; 8.1;  3.1.
It is now commonly (contrast De Rossi, Inscr. <bibl>Christ. ii. 38</bibl>; 99. 7; 324. 6)
placed at the east end of the pons Aelius, on the left bank of the river
(Richter 72; HF iii); and Jord. (i. I. 378-390), who shares this view,
further identifies it with the porta Cornelia, holding that the passage
through the fortifications of the <ref target="mausoleum-hadriani" n="U">MAUSOLEUM HADRIANI</ref> (q.v.) was not
viewed as a city gate at all; but in this he has not been generally followed.
<pb n="405"/>
He is, however, right in pointing out that it is incorrect, as Richter
and Lanciani (Mon. <bibl>L. i. 447</bibl>) still do, to call it Porta S. Petri in Hadrianeo
(DMH) and that the two phrases should be divided. If, however, there
was only one Porta S. Petri, the inscriptions published by De Rossi
would have belonged to the gate on the left bank of the river. It occurs
in the form Porta Aurea in Magister Gregorius (<bibl>JRS 1919, 19</bibl>, 46), in the
Mirabilia and in <bibl>LPD i. 152</bibl>. See also T ix. 472; <bibl>JRS 1925, 81</bibl>, n. 2.</p>

<p> a gate in the Servian wall on the south-west slope of the

issued (<bibl>Liv. i. 26</bibl>. 2; <bibl>iii. 22</bibl>. 4; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vii. 697</bibl>; Frontinus, aq.

110, 115, 347). The ancient derivation of the name from the Etruscan
Capena (Serv. loc. cit.) is highly improbable, and no satisfactory explanation has been found (Jord. i. I. 270-271). The discovery of several
portions of the wall in 1867-1868, and of what is probably a pier of the
gate itself during the recent construction of the Passeggiata archeologica,
has definitely established its location (see Jord. i. I. 228; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 293</bibl>,
for references to the literature of earlier excavations; <bibl>NS 1909, 427</bibl>;
<bibl>BC 1908, 109-150</bibl>; Bartoli, Rassegna Cont. iii. No. 2, 1910, 19 ; T ix. 19).
Domitian is said to have restored the porta Capena (Chron. 146), but as
a mere gateway would have had no meaning then, the restoration was
probably in connection with the extension of the aqua Marcia, which
was brought across the Caelian by a branch, the rivus Herculaneus,
and ended supra portam  Capenam  (<bibl>Frontinus i. 19</bibl>). This aqueduct
was at too low a level to have crossed to the Aventine; but there was
another and higher branch which crossed the gateway, as is clear from
references in literature (<bibl>Frontinus ii. 76</bibl>-the Caelian and Aventine
<foreign xml:lang="la">priusquam Claudia perduceretur, utebantur Marcia et Iulia</foreign>; <bibl>Mart. iii. 47</bibl>;
<bibl>Iuv. iii. 11</bibl> and Schol.). The latest investigation, however, of the remains

<p> a gate in the Servian wall, named from a neighbouring
altar and grove of Laverna (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 163</bibl>; Fest. 117; CIL i.' 446 <note anchored="true" place="foot">=ib. xi. 6708.
</note>;
<bibl>Rosch. ii. 1917-1918</bibl>). It is mentioned by Varro after the Naevia and
Raudusculana, and is therefore generally supposed to have been west of
these two on the Aventine, where an ancient road, corresponding to the
present Via del Priorato, passed through the wall (Jord. i. I. 234; HJ
168; Merlin 119-121). According to a scholiast (Ps. Acro ad Hor. ep. i.
16. 60): <foreign xml:lang="la">Laverna viae Salariae lucum habet</foreign>, and this has been used to
support a theory that this gate was in the northern part of the city and
not on the Aventine at all (<bibl>BPW  1913, 980-1</bibl>). See also WR 236; <bibl>RE

Sylloge Turonensis (De Rossi, Inscr. <bibl>Christ. ii. 64</bibl>.  5) is the road from this
gate to the via Latina. It was in origin only a postern, as it has no towers,
and no important road left it; it corresponded to the <ref target="porta-querquetulana" n="U">PORTA QUERQUETULANA</ref> (q.v.) of the Servian wall. It was blocked up at an uncertain
date-certainly before the <date value="1450">middle of the fifteenth century</date>. The Marrana,
a stream which passes under the Aurelian wall at this point, was brought
into the city by Calixtus II in 1122, and he must have closed the gate at
the same time,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It has been pointed out by Lais (Rivo dell' Acqua Mariana <bibl>(Grottaferrata, 1925)</bibl>,

<p> one of the three gates of the early Palatine city (Varro,
<bibl>LL v. 164</bibl>), also called vetus porta Palatii (Liv. i. I. 12; 3. 9). It was on
the north side of the hill, near the temple of Jupiter Stator (Liv. locc. citt. ;
<bibl>Solin. i. 24</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 50</bibl>; Non. 531; cf. Ov. Trist. iii. I. 31), where
the ridge of the Velia joins the Palatine and the cattle of the early settlers
must have been driven in and out (Jord. i. I. 174, 176, 177; Richter
34, 133, 140, 145; <bibl>Gilb. i. 159</bibl>, 309; <bibl>iii. 46</bibl>, 423). The existing street
of imperial times (see <ref target="clivus-palatinus" n="U">CLIVUS PALATINUS</ref>) corresponds in general with the
early one.</p>
<p>The name appears in several variants-Mugionis (Non.), Mugionia
(Festus 144), Mucionis (Varro), Mugonia (Solin.), and is derived by Varro
from the lowing (mugitus) of the cattle, but by Festus <foreign xml:lang="la">a Mugio quodam

<p> a gate in the Aurelian wall from which the <ref target="via-nomentana" n="U">VIA
NOMENTANA</ref> (q.v.) issued (DMH), 75 metres to the south-east of the
modern Porta Pia, which was erected by Pius IV in <date value="1564">1564</date>. It retained its
ancient name until the <dateRange from="1200" to="1299">thirteenth century</dateRange> (T in loc.); it occurs under the
form of Numantia in Magister Gregorius (<bibl>JRS 1919, 19</bibl>, 46). It had two
semi-circular towers, the left-hand one of which, in brickwork attributable
to Aurelian, stands on a square brick tomb, while the right-hand one,
removed in 1827, stood upon the tomb of one Q. Haterius (<bibl>CIL vi. 1426</bibl>;
see <ref target="sep-q-haterii" n="U">SEPULCRUM Q. HATERII</ref>). The analogy of the porta Salaria suggests
that the curtain had three large windows over a single arch; and it is the
only example of one of Aurelian's original gates which has not been
re-faced. Immediately to the south-east there is a small postern (LF 3 ;

Lateran '<foreign xml:lang="la">per Ostiensem portam piscinamque publicam circo illatus est

the modern form Porta S. Paolo, as early as the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> (Procop. <bibl>BG

with it (<bibl>JRS 1919, 20</bibl>, 46, 56).</p>
<p>It is probable that, like the porta Appia and the porta Flaminia, it
originally had a double arch; and this explains why there are two arches
of travertine side by side in the inner gateway (Ill. 41), which belongs
to a later restoration, as Aurelian does not appear to have constructed
any of his gates with courtyards. The two arches of the outer gateway
were suppressed at some unknown date, and replaced by a single arch
in travertine with a very wide curtain, flanked by two semi-circular brick
towers. Such towers should as a rule be attributed to Aurelian, but
here they have been strengthened at a later date, and there are considerable traces of alterations throughout, though parts of the original
curtain still remain. The rise in level at the time of Honorius has been
greatly overestimated (LD 54, fig. 13). See <bibl>BC 1927, 57-59</bibl>.</p>
<p>Adjacent to the gate on the right is the <ref target="sep-c-cestii" n="U">SEPULCRUM C. CESTII</ref> (q.v.),
and beyond it again was a postern for the exit of the road from the porta
Trigemina, which fell into the via Ostiensis. Some of its pavement,
discovered in 1824, may be seen in the ditch of the old Protestant cemetery. This postern was, according to some authorities, closed by Honorius
(Jord. i. I. 368; Mon. <bibl>L. i. 512</bibl>; LF 44; T iv. 7-13); but it can well have
happened much earlier (<bibl>PBS x. 21</bibl>).</p>

postern, and was transformed into a gate by Honorius, who converted
the square tower on the right into a semi-circular one, and added the.
round tower on the left. At one time it had three stories, as older
views show. The arch is of travertine and so was the threshold; one
of the slabs of the latter bore the fragmentary sepulchral inscription

incorporated in the wall of Aurelian (DMH). These two roads separated
just before passing under the aqueduct, the Labicana branching off
to the right and the Praenestina to the left, and the two archways are
<pb n="413"/>
at a very slight angle with each other, inasmuch as the course of the roads
is at first almost parallel. The whole structure is of travertine, 32 metres
high and 24 wide, and the two principal arches are 14 metres high,
6.35 wide and 6.20 deep. In the central pier is a small archway, 5.10
metres high and 1.80 wide, now closed and almost entirely below the
present level of the ground. Above this, and at the same level in the
north and south piers, are other arched openings, with engaged Corinthian
columns and an entablature. The attic is divided longitudinally by string
courses into three sections, each of which has an inscription (<bibl>CIL
vi. 1256-1258</bibl>), the upper one recording the original construction by
Claudius but probably revised by Trajan (M61. 1906, 305-318), and the
Other two, restorations by Vespasian and Titus . <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Of these three sections only the upper two were used for the two aqueducts, the lower
one being purely ornamental.
</note> Immediately outside
this gate, between the two roads, is the <ref target="sep-eurysacis" n="U">SEPULCRUM EURYSACIS</ref> (q.v.),
belonging to the end of the republic. It stood about 3.50 metres below

<p>Aurelian incorporated this double arch in his wall, and Honorius <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The statement that the arch was closed by Honorius (PBS cit.) is erroneous; cf. Gell
and Nibby, Mura di Roma, 349, and pl. xiv.
</note>
changed it very considerably: he certainly built a curtain wall with two
openings (on the right-hand one was <bibl>CIL vi. 1189</bibl>), thus forming a courtyard. With this building scheme seem to go the square towers at each
end on the outside; while the semicircular tower in the middle over the
tomb of Eurysaces may belong to Aurelian. The latest ancient road
level is 1.50 m. below the modern.</p>
<p>The right-hand opening was blocked at a later date (Ill. 38). In
1838 these <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth-century</dateRange> additions were removed and the arches of the
aqueduct exposed to view (Jord. i. I. 357; Reber 528-532; <bibl>PBS i. 500</bibl>).
The gate appears in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> (Procop. <bibl>BG i. 18</bibl>), when we have
our first record of it, as the porta Praenestina. This name continued
in use during the Middle Ages, along with Sessoriana and Labicana,

the name came from bronze horns affixed to the gate in memory of the
praetor Genucius Cipus, from whose forehead horns had sprung as he was
passing through it on his way to war. This was interpreted as an augury
that he would be king if he returned to Rome, and to avoid this disaster

... sepulchrum Accae ... qui uterque locus extra urbem antiquam fuit
non longe a porta Romanula; Fest. 262: Romanam  portam  vulgus
appellat ubi ex epistylio defluit aqua; qui locus ab antiquis appellari
solitus est statuae Cinciae, quod in eo fuit sepulcrum eius familiae. Sed
porta Romana instituta est a Romulo infimo clivo Victoriae; qui locus
gradibus in quadram formatus est. Appellata autem Romana a Sabinis
praecipue quod ea proximus aditus erat Romam; ib. 263: Romana
porta apud Romam a Sabinis appellata est quod per ear proximus eis
aditus esset</foreign>; ib. 269 is quite fragmentary). Romanula is, however,
clearly an incorrect form (Jord. i. I. 176; <bibl>Glotta i. 295</bibl>). The topographical indications (<foreign xml:lang="la">infimo clivo Victoriae-proximus aditus Romam-quae habet gradus in nova via ad sacellum Volupiae</foreign>) point to a site on
the west side of the Palatine at the foot, or lower part, of the <ref target="clivus-victoriae" n="U">CLIVUS
VICTORIAE</ref> (q.v.), where steps led down to the Nova via. The sacellum
Volupiae is wholly unknown. Although the original course of the clivus
Victoriae is uncertain, the gate was probably situated a little south of
the church of S. Teodoro (Jord. i. I. 176; <bibl>Gilb. i. 42</bibl>, 121-122; <bibl>ii. 114-115</bibl>;
Ann. d. <bibl>Inst. 1884, 203-204</bibl>; RE i. A. 2189; Richter 34; for the presentation of another view according to which the gate was at the north
corner of the hill, at the junction of the three existing ramps, or stairways,
from the Nova via, the forum, and the Velabrum see WR 241; M6l. 1908,
256-258). Support of this view is sought in the statement of Festus
' <foreign xml:lang="la">qui locus gradibus in quadram formatus est,</foreign>' which seems to mean that
the gate stood on a raised stone area approached by steps on all sides.</p>
<p>According  to  another explanation  than  that given by Festus
(Kretschmer, <bibl>Glotta i. 295</bibl>), the name porta Romana is evidence that the
Palatine settlement was not called Roma, since this designation of this
gate indicated that it opened towards Roma which was then the district
of the Velabrum and forum Boarium. Platner (in <bibl>CP 1917, 196</bibl>) pointed
out that had this been so, some trace of the transfer of the name to the
Palatine would have been found in tradition. The old view, according
to which Roma could be connected with ruma, rumon, ' a stream,' made
it easy to explain the gate as the river-gate; but if the name is a tribal
name, ' why can we not explain the porta Romana most easilyby supposing
that this powerful Etruscan clan, or family, dwelt at this north-west
corner of the hill-where tradition puts the first settlement, and that the
gate, as well as the whole enclosure, got its name from this fact ? ' A
still later view is that of Herbig (<bibl>BPW  1916, 1440</bibl> ff., 1472 ff., summarised
by Nogara in DAP 2. xiii. 279 and <bibl>BC 1916, 141</bibl>), that Roma is the
latinized form of the Etruscan ruma, 'breast' (cf. Varro, RR ii. II. 5:
<foreign xml:lang="la">mamma enim rumis sive ruminare</foreign>) and as a proper name means 'large
breasted,' i.e. strong or powerful.</p>
<p>Another inference from Festus' statement is that the real site of the
gate had been forgotten, and identified with that of the tomb of the
Cincii, probably not far away.</p>

<p>In GMU 87; <bibl>R. ii. 405</bibl>, it is called Porta Sancti Silvestri, because it
led to the catacombs of S. Priscilla, where he was buried, though Magister
Gregorius gives it under its correct name (<bibl>JRS 1919, 19</bibl>, 46). It was
flanked by two semi-circular towers of brickwork, that of the west tower
being perhaps the original work of Aurelian, below which were tombs
faced with marble, wrongly described by Nibby (Mura di Roma 321) as
bastions. The arch was of stone, with a brick arcade repaired in opus

is, a gate opening into the area occupied by the buildings of Severus
(cf. Septimianum, HJ 656) in this region, and afterwards incorporated
in the wall of Aurelian. That it is not mentioned in DMH, GMU, or
any early mediaeval documents, is strange, but there must have been
at least one gate in the wall between the porta Aurelia and the river,
and this lies on the line which the wall would naturally have followed

<p> a gate in the Aurelian wall (III. 44), by which the <ref target="via-tiburtina" n="U">VIA
TIBURTINA</ref> (q.v.) left the city (DMH). In the <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange> it was known
as Porta S. Laurentii, because it led to the church of that name (GMU 88;
R ii. 406). There seems to be no trace in the present gate of any work
by Aurelian, who may have simply restricted himself to flanking with two
towers the arch by which the aquae Marcia, Tepula and Iulia crossed the
road. This was rebuilt by Augustus in <date value="-5">5 B.C.</date>, and also bears inscriptions
of Vespasian and Septimius Severus, relating to the aqueducts (<bibl>CIL vi.

name porta Taurina, which we find in the Liber Pontificalis in the lives
of Alexander I (<bibl>LPD i. 127</bibl>) and Anastasius I (ib. 258) as well as in the
Mirabilia (<bibl>Jord. ii. 319-328</bibl>); while Magister Gregorius (<bibl>JRS 1919, 20</bibl>,

dispute, since the line of the wall has not yet been determined in this
quarter. Some place it below the present church of S. Sabina (LF 34;
Jord. i. I. 235; <bibl>Gilb. ii. 296</bibl>); others about 40 metres south of S. Maria
in Cosmedin, where an arch of tufa, 3.30 metres wide, over a paved road,
was found in 1886 (<bibl>NS 1886, 274</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1888, 20-22</bibl>; <bibl>Mel. 1909, 129-132</bibl>;

the Aventine, near S. Anna dei Calzettari, about halfway between the
other two points (KH i.; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 260</bibl>; for a presentation of all the
different views and their literature, see Merlin, 96-97, 125-126, and cf.
<ref target="murus-servii-tullii" n="U">MURUS SERVII TULLII</ref>). The last of these theories is the most probable.</p>
<p>The name is best explained by supposing that the gate had three
openings, to accommodate the heavy traffic of this district and of the
<ref target="via-ostiensis" n="U">VIA OSTIENSIS</ref> (q.v.) (cf., however, Richter 46). Just outside it was a
favourite resort for beggars (Plaut. Capt. 90), and a statue of L. Minucius

Ivi. 42; Suet. Aug. 100; Joseph. Bell. <bibl>Iud. vii. 5</bibl>. 4), but only the last
contains any topographical indications. These seem to point to a location
in the campus Martius, not far from the circus Flaminius and the villa
Publica. Four views have been held as to the character of this gate
and its site: (I) that it was a gate in the Servian wall between the porta
Flumentana and the porta Carmentalis (Nibby, Mura di <bibl>Roma 1821,
132-134</bibl>; Piale, Delle porte del monte Aventino e delle altre occidentali
di Roma, 1834, 19-27; LR 64); (2) that the circus Maximus abutted
on the city wall and that the porta Triumphalis was its principal entrance
at this point (Bunsen, Beschreibung der Stadt <bibl>Rom i. 630-633</bibl>; ii.I. 439-441;
M61. 1909, 135-140); (3) that it was merely a name given to any gate
through which the victorious general entered the city, or to a temporary
arch erected at any point along the line of march (Morpurgo, <bibl>BC 1908,
107-150</bibl>); (4) that it was an arch or gate standing by itself in the campus
Martius, according to the indications of Josephus noted above (Becker,
Topogr. 149-154; HJ 495; Richter 124).  This is the generally accepted
explanation at present. For a full discussion and citation of literature,
see Morpurgo op. cit.; v. Domaszewski, <bibl>AR 1909, 70</bibl>, 73, who thinks

</head>
<p> the Roman adaptation of the Greek a-ro, varying more or less
in detail, but consisting in general of a covered colonnade formed by a
wall and one or more parallel rows of columns, or less frequently by
columns alone. There were two prevailing types, one enclosing a rectangular area, either open and laid out like a garden, or occupied by a
temple, and the second a long gallery bordering on a street. In either
case the porticus might be an independent structure, or attached to
adjacent buildings. In the gardens of the rich Romans even the driveways
seem to have been under such colonnades.
The earliest porticus known to us were built in <date value="-193">193 B.C.</date> by two
members of the gens Aemilia, but the period of rapid development in
numbers and use began in the last century of the republic and continued
in the Augustan era (Stuart Jones, Companion 108-110). The earlier
porticus were devoted mainly to business purposes, but during the
empire they were intended primarily to provide places for walking and
lounging that should be sheltered from sun and wind. For this reason
the intercolumnar spaces were sometimes filled with glass or hedges of
box. Within the porticus or the apartments connected with them, were
collections of statuary, paintings, and works of art, as well as shops and
bazaars. A porticus took its name from its builder, its purpose, the
structure to which it was attached or of which it formed a part, or
sometimes from some famous statue or painting preserved within it (e.g.
<ref target="porticus-argonautarum" n="U">PORTICUS ARGONAUTARUM</ref>).</p>
<p>The campus Martius was particularly well adapted to the development
of the porticus, and by the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange> there were upwards of twelve
in <rs key="regio9" type="region">Region IX</rs>, some of them of great size, and it was possible to walk

(q.v.). It derived its name from the paintings on its walls of the adventures of the Argonauts, and seems to have been also called the porticus
Agrippiana (Schol. <bibl>Iuv. vi.  54</bibl>). Cassius Dio (loc. cit.) calls it <foreign xml:lang="greek">stoa\ tou= poseidw=nos</foreign>, and elsewhere (lxvi. 24) speaks of a <foreign xml:lang="greek">*poseidw/nion</foreign>, which is
probably the same building. It is sometimes identified with the <ref target="basilica-neptuni" n="U">BASILICA
NEPTUNI</ref> (q.v.), although both names occur in the Curiosum in Reg. IX.
It is possible that the porticus may have belonged to a temple of Neptune,
although <foreign xml:lang="greek">*poseidw/nion</foreign> does not necessarily refer to a temple, and there is
no other evidence for the existence of one in this region. This porticus
was one of the most frequented in Rome (<bibl>Mart. ii. 14</bibl>. 6; <bibl>iii. 20</bibl>. 11;

beneath the Tabularium and the supporting wall of the clivus Capitolinus,

marble, on which is a row of small rooms, 4 metres high and 3.70 deep,

represented on three fragments of the Marble Plan (10, 11, 109), and
was situated on the north slope of the Oppius on the south side of the
clivus Suburanus, between this street and the later baths of Trajan.
The porticus was rectangular, about 115 metres long and 75 wide, with
an outer wall and double row of columns within. In each of the long
sides were three niches, the central one square, the others semi-circular.
There was also a semi-circular apse on the south side. The entrance was
on the north, where a flight of steps, 20 metres wide, led down to the
clivus Suburanus. In the centre of the area was something that appears
to have been a fountain, but may possibly be the <ref target="concordia-aedes-2" n="U">AEDES CONCORDIAE</ref>

on the Sacra via, though the inscriptions are all of the early imperial

the Atrium Vestae, are massive foundations of the time of Nero (<bibl>AJA

of later brick walls. The former belong to a very large porticus, which
served as the approach from the forum to the vestibule of the domus
Aurea. The floor of this building was originally undivided, except by its
piers of travertine, but partition walls of brick were afterwards put up
(LR 210-21; <bibl>BC 1899, 256</bibl>; 9000, 11, pis. i., ii.; <bibl>CR 1900, 238</bibl>; <bibl>1905,

it is possible that a part of it, as Lanciani thinks, still later became the
porticus Margaritaria, in spite of the objections of Hiulsen (<bibl>AA 1900, 9</bibl>;
<bibl>1902, 51</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 95</bibl>; HJ 15), who agrees with Jordan (i. 2. 476)

This reading seems to oblige us to suppose that the porticus was triple

the plural is no evidence that the porticus was double, or that there
were two buildings, for Velleius uses it elsewhere of a single porticus
(ii. I. 2), as do other writers (e.g. Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv.  14</bibl>). In it Antonius,
and probably other officials, set up their tribunals (Cic. <bibl>Phil. ii. 84</bibl>: in
porticu Minucia), and it is mentioned in Apuleius (de mundo 35: <foreign xml:lang="la">alius
ad Minuciam frumentatum venit</foreign>) and in the Historia Augusta (Commod.
16:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Herculis signum aeneum sudavit in Minucia per plures dies</foreign>). In
the calendars it occurs twice (Praen. ad xi Kal. Ian., CIL is. p. 238: laribus
permarinis in porticu Minucia; Filoc. ad prid. Non. Iun., CIL i. p. 266:
ludi in Minicia; cf. p. 338), and in several inscriptions of the first four
centuries (see below), but always alone and in the singular.</p>
<p>Chron. (p. 146) places a Minucia vetus among the buildings of Domitian,
and Reg. has (Reg. IX) <foreign xml:lang="la">porticus Philippi Minuciam veterem et frumentariam (Cur. Minucias duas veterem et frumentariam), cryptam Balbi</foreign>.
Apparently, therefore, by the time of Domitian at least a Minucia
vetus was distinguished from a newer Minucia, presumably the frumentaria of the Notitia. From the time of Claudius the distribution of grain
to the populace took place in the porticus Minucia (cf. Apuleius, loc. cit.),
the earliest evidence being an inscription of his reign or Nero's (<bibl>CIL vi.
10223</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Ti. Claudius Aug. lib. Ianuarius curator de Minucia die xiii
ostio xlii</foreign>). This together with two others of pueri alimentarii (CIL

</note>: frum(entum)

Tullius preserved in the Chronograph (p. 144:<foreign xml:lang="la"> hic votum fecit ut quotquot

lead tessera (Rostowzew, Sylloge No. 336; Klio, <bibl>Suppl. iii. 21-22</bibl>) with
Minucia on the reverse side, show that the porticus Minucia was divided
into 45 ostia or sections, in which definite groups of people received their
doles in definite days in the month. The officials of this department
are mentioned in three other inscriptions of the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange> (<bibl>CIL
xi. 5669</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> proc. Aug. ad Minuciam</foreign>; <bibl>vi. 1648</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> proc. Mini(ciae)</foreign>; <bibl>iii. 249</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">proc. Min(uciae)</foreign> ), and perhaps in two more (vi. 1408: cur. Min(uciae);
<bibl>xi. 4182</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">prae(fectus ?) Minicia)</foreign>.</p>
<p>Beginning with the time of Severus the name of the porticus appears
in inscriptions of officials of the water department (v. 7783:<foreign xml:lang="la"> curator
aquarum  et Minuciae</foreign>; <bibl>vi. 1532</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">cur. aquar. et Miniciae</foreign>; <bibl>x. 4752</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">consulari aquarum et Minuciae</foreign>; <bibl>xiv. 3902</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">curator aquarum et Miniciae</foreign>;
NS 19O1, 129-131; cf. Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsrecht ii. 1053-1054</bibl>). Whether
this indicates that one man held both offices, or that the Minucia now
belonged to the department of water and not of grain, or that both offices
were housed in one building, or that the Minucia of the inscriptions is
the Minucia vetus, while the distribution of grain still took place in the
frumentaria, is doubtful. The relation of the vetus and frumentaria
is very uncertain, whether they were separate buildings, or parts of one;
and when the second building or part was erected. It is natural to assign
the frumentaria to Claudius, but the absence of any differentiation, except
in the Chronograph and Regionary Catalogue, is curious (Hirschfeld,
<bibl>Phil. 1870, 63-67</bibl>; Kaiserl. Verwaltungsbeamtens 238; Klio, ii. 244,
271; <bibl>Suppl. iii. 15-16</bibl>; <bibl>DE iii. 268-269</bibl>; <bibl>RE vii. 177-178</bibl>; Marquardt,
<bibl>Staatsverwaltung ii. 128-130</bibl>; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 144</bibl>, 286).</p>
<p>There is also divergence of opinion as to the site of the porticus.
The prevailing view at present is that there were two separate buildings,
near the porticus Philippi and theatre of Balbus (cf. Not.), one of which,
the vetus, enclosed the temple of the Lares Permarini (fast. Praen.) and
perhaps that of Hercules Custos (cf. Hist. Aug. Corn. loc. cit.), and
therefore was situated north of the circus Flaminius and east of the
porticus Pompei, on both sides of the Petronia stream (<bibl>AR 1909, 76</bibl>, pl. i.;
KH ii.). The frumentaria Hilsen then places about 200 metres south
of the vetus, and identifies with ruins that lie close to the probable site
of the crypta Balbi (Sangallo,p.9,47). In the Via dei Calderari, No. 23, two
travertine pilasters with engaged columns and the entablature are built
into the front of the house, and there are traces of a second row of columns
and a wall behind. Drawings of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> show that this
colonnade had an upper story, with columns standing on the centre of
the arches below. There are also blocks of travertine pavement (NS 1891,

expressed on his map of 1912). Hfilsen is further inclined to derive the name
of S. Maria de Publico (so called in a bull of 1186 and generally till the end
of the <dateRange from="1400" to="1499">fifteenth century</dateRange>), now known as S. Maria in Publicolis,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This form only came in during the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> when the Santacroce family
traced their pedigree back to the Valerii Publicolae.
</note> from the
frumentum publicum distributed here (HCh 361; <bibl>BC 1927, 94-100</bibl>).</p>
<p>Another theory (Canina, Edif. ii. pl. 149; LR 513; LF 28; Delbriick,
Die drei Tempel am  Forum  Holitorium, Rome 1903, I) is that the
porticus lay between the foot of the Capitol and the theatre of Marcellus,
thus identifying the two buildings with ruins on the east side of the Piazza
Montanara and in the Vicolo della Bufala (<bibl>NS 1879, 314</bibl>; <bibl>1891, 316</bibl>;
<bibl>Mitt. 1892, 292</bibl>). This view, however, Lanciani has recently abandoned,
chiefly because of the small area available, and thinks that the porticus
was farther north-west, between the hill and the porticus Octaviae
(<bibl>BC 1917, 187-192</bibl>). There is no conclusive evidence for any of the
views that have been held.</p>

is unknown, unless it was connected in some way, as an addition or

the statues by Coponius of the fourteen nations over which Pompeius

a <ref target="bibliotheca-porticus-octaviae" n="U">BIBLIOTHECA</ref> (q.v.) erected by Octavia in memory of the youthful
Marcellus (Suet. de gramm. 21; Plut. Marc. 30), a curia Octaviae (Plin.
<bibl>NH xxxvi. 28</bibl>), and a schola (ib. xxxv. 114) or scholae (ib. xxxvi. 22).
Whether these were different parts of one building, or entirely different
structures, is uncertain. It was probably in the curia that the senate
is recorded as meeting (Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 8</bibl>; Joseph. B. <bibl>Iud. vii. 5</bibl>. 4). The
whole is referred to by Pliny as Octaviae opera (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 31</bibl>;

<p>This porticus is represented on the Marble Plan (frg. 33). It enclosed
a rectangular area, 118 metres in width and somewhat more in length,
and consisted of a colonnade formed by a double row of granite columns,
twenty-eight in each row in front. The main axis ran from north-east
to south-west, and the principal entrance was in the middle of the south-
west side. This entrance, of which some ruins still exist (Bull. d. <bibl>Inst.
1878, 209-219</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1887, 331</bibl>; <bibl>1890, 66-67</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 264-265</bibl>; <bibl>NS

outward. Across each front of this pronaos, between the side walls,
were four Corinthian columns of white marble, supporting an entablature
and triangular pediment. The entablature and pediment and two
of the columns of the outer front still exist (the other two have been
replaced by a brick arch, perhaps after the earthquake of <date value="442">A.D. 442</date>), and
of the inner front two columns and part of the third, with portions of
entablature and pediment. The height of the columns of the pronaos
is 8.60 metres. Some of the marble antefixae at the lower ends of the
ridge tiles also exist. Parts of some of the columns of the south colonnade
are also standing, and some of their capitals are built into the walls of
neighbouring houses (HJ 541-544; D'Esp. <bibl>Mon. ii. 131-133</bibl>; <bibl>Fr. i. 65</bibl>, 66;

was to afford shelter for the spectators in case of rain (<bibl>Vitr. v. 9</bibl>. 1). It
is represented on the Marble Plan (frgs. 30, 110, and p. 22), and was a
rectangular court, about 180 metres long and 135 wide, in which were
four parallel rows of columns. The central area was laid out as a garden
with shady walks (<bibl>Prop. ii. 32</bibl>. 11-12) and contained various works of
art (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 59</bibl>, 114, 126, 132). Among these was a painting
of Cadmus and Europa by Antiphilus, which is not to be identified with
the representation of Europa which gave its name to the <ref target="porticus-europae" n="U">PORTICUS

Tarentum (Cic. <bibl>Verr. iv. 135</bibl>; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 31</bibl>). The <ref target="curia-pompei" n="U">CURIA POMPEI</ref>

is clear from the numerous incidental references (Cic. de fato 8; de off.

<p>The porticus was burned in the reign of Carinus (Hist. Aug. Car. 19),
and restored by Diocletian (Chron. 148: porticos ii), under the direction
of Aelius Helvius Dionysius, the prefect of the city (<bibl>CIL vi. 255</bibl>, 256),
who called one side of the restored structure porticus Iovia, and the
<pb n="429"/>
other porticus Herculea, in honour of the two emperors Diocletian and
Maximian. It may be referred to as the portica Nova, which was ruined
by the earthquake of 442 (Consul. Ital. Chron. min. ed. <bibl>Mommsen

<p> a porticus supposed to have stood near the porta

evidence of two inscriptions recording ' porticus triumphi,' one near Rome
(<bibl>CIL vi. 29776</bibl>) and the other at Baiae (<bibl>EE viii. 374</bibl>), which were evidently
small private imitations of a public structure at Rome (<bibl>NS 1888, 709-714</bibl>;
<bibl>BC 1889, 355-358</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 268</bibl>; LR 475; <bibl>JRS 1921, 28-29</bibl>). In
both of them the length is recorded, and the number of times necessary
to go and return in order to complete a mile (or in the second case a little
more). Cf. Atti Accad. <bibl>Nap. 1924, 123-136</bibl> (where 'porticus tri(plex) ' is
proposed); <bibl>NS 1926, 229</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 29774-29778</bibl>.</p>
<p>For a similar inscription from Hadrian's Villa, relating to the so-called
Poikile (really a huge gestatio in modum circi), in which, however, the
name triumphi does not actually occur, see Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1895, 140</bibl>,
and AA 234; <bibl>AA 1896, 47</bibl>. The insistence on a mile (or a little more)
as a convenient measure for a walk (cf. 
<ref target="porticus-miliaria" n="U">PORTICUS MILIARIA</ref>) does not imply that the original porticus Triumphi was a
mile long (though it may very well have been some fraction of a mile);
and it may therefore quite well have been wholly included in the Villa
Publica (Makin in JRS cit.).</p>

the via Lata, occupying the western part of the <ref target="campus-agrippae" n="U">CAMPUS AGRIPPAE</ref> (q.v.).
It was near the aqua Virgo (<bibl>Mart. iv. 18</bibl>. 1-2: <foreign xml:lang="la">qua vicina pluit Vipsania

it has hitherto been supposed that it extended nearly as far south as that

209</bibl>; <bibl>1915, 218</bibl>; <bibl>1917, 220</bibl>) seem to indicate that a colonnade on the
south side of the Via del Tritone was the southern end of the porticus.
Farther south no traces of such a building have been found. Hulsen
indeed identifies it with the PORTICUS EUROPAE (q.v.).
In this porticus was a map of the world, prepared by order of Agrippa
(Plin. <bibl>NH iii. 17</bibl>); there were laurels in its garden (<bibl>Mart. i. 108</bibl>. I); and
detachments of the Illyrian army camped in it in <date value="69">69 A.D.</date> (Plut. Galba 25;

<p>In construction it resembled the <ref target="saepta-iulia" n="U">SAEPTA</ref> (q.v.) on the outer side of

walls, thus making rows of separate chambers. At various points in the

marginal readings be correct, Portunium  must mean the immediate

<placeName>QUIRINALIS COLLIS</placeName>
</head>
<p> the most northerly of the traditional seven hills
of Rome, which stretched from the northern extension of the Esquiline
plateau in a south-westerly direction. It is a narrow irregular tongue,
separated from the Viminal on the south by the depression now traversed
by the Via Nazionale, and sloping off more gradually on the north and
north-west to the campus Martius and the valley occupied during the
late republic by the <ref target="horti-sallustiani" n="U">HORTI SALLUSTIANI</ref> (q.v.). The length of this
tongue from the porta Collina in the Servian wall to the collis Latiaris
(see below) is a little more than two kilometres. While there was a fairly
deep depression between the Capitol and the Quirinal, as is shown by the
pavement of the street found beneath the column of Trajan, yet the
complete division between the two was made by the great excavations
<pb n="437"/>
for the forum of Trajan. The highest point of the hill seems to have
been within the area now  covered by the Royal Gardens, for which
considerable levelling off was done in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries (Hulsen, Rom. Antikengarten 85 sqq.). In general, excavations
indicate that marked changes of this sort were made both in antiquity
(see <ref target="forum-traiani" n="U">FORUM  TRAIANI</ref>) and in more recent times, which have modified
both the height and contour of the hill. The height of the Royal
Gardens is now  50 metres above sea-level, and that of the Treasury
buildings 60 (A. Verri, II Colle Quirinale, Bull. Soc. Geol. Ital. 1908;
S. Agata dei Goti (by Hulsen and others) <bibl>Rome 1924, 3</bibl> sqq.).</p>
<p>On the north and west slope of the hill were at least four approaches
through cuts or depressions, three of which were marked by gates in the
Servian wall, <ref target="porta-sanqualis" n="U">PORTA SANQUALIS</ref>,<ref target="porta-sanqualis" n="U"> P. SALUTARIS</ref>, and <ref target="porta-sanqualis" n="U">P. QUIRINALIS</ref>
(qq.v.), corresponding  to the modern Vie Nazionale, Dataria, and
Quattro Fontane. The fourth led up to the top of the hill near the
new tunnel under the Royal Gardens (<bibl>BC 1926, 145-175</bibl>).</p>
<p>Like the Viminal, the Quirinal was a collis, not a mons (for apparent
exceptions-<bibl>Flor. i. 7</bibl>. 16; <bibl>Eutrop. i. 7</bibl>-see <bibl>CP 1907, 463-464</bibl>), and the
description of the Argei (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 51</bibl>) preserves the names of the
parts into which it was originally divided-collis Latiaris, the southern
end; collis Mucialis, north of the Latiaris from the Via di Magnanapoli
to the monte Cavallo; collis Salutaris, from Monte Cavallo to the church
of S. Andrea; and collis Quirinalis, from this point east. The derivation
of the first two names is unknown  (HJ 399-400), and they, together
with Salutaris (cf. <ref target="salus-aedes" n="U">SALUS</ref>), evidently passed out of use at an early date.
Quirinalis then became the proper designation of the whole hill. This
name was derived by Roman antiquarians from the inhabitants of the
Sabine town Cures, who settled on this hill and were afterwards incorporated in Rome (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 51</bibl>; Fest. 10, 254; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 179-180),
or from the god Quirinus, who was identified with Romulus (Ov. <bibl>Fast.
ii. 511</bibl>; for the literature of the disputed etymology of Quirinalis, see
WR 153; Walde, Lat. etym. W6rterb. s.v.).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Quirinus was itself derived from ' quiris,' the Sabine word for a lance (Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 477</bibl>,
etc.). Others prefer to derive it from the place-name Quirium (WR cit.; <bibl>Mitt. 1921,
16</bibl>, 17). For the rejection of all these views and a proposed derivation from' quernus'
(oak), see Klio, 1926, 74-78.
</note>  Whatever the true derivation, there is no doubt that, during the historical period, the hill was
regarded as having been named from the god <ref target="quirinus-aedes" n="U">QUIRINUS</ref>, whose temple
(q.v.) stood near the porta Quirinalis. Festus states (io, 234) that
this hill was first called Agonus, but this is probably only an invention
of the antiquarians.</p>
<p>The Quirinal is not enumerated among the hills of the Septimontium,
and did not become a part of Rome until the organisation of the Four
Regions, when, with the Viminal, it formed the third, Collina. There
are traces of primitive settlements on this hill, and the tradition that
they belonged to Sabines is probably founded on fact (for a discussion
<pb n="438"/>
of these primitive settlements,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For the erroneous theory that the earliest settlement of Rome was on the Quirinal,

RE i. A. 1016-1008, and for the early cemeteries, see HJ 397, 398;
Pinza, Mon. cit. 248-264). The Servian wall ran along the north-west
edge of the Quirinal from the collis Latiaris to the porta Collina, where
the agger began, and ran almost due south (see <ref target="murus-servii-tullii" n="U">MURUS SERVII TULLII</ref>).
In the Augustan division of the city the Quirinal fell into <rs key="regio6" type="region">Region VI</rs>,
which was afterwards called Alta Semita, from the main street that ran
along the ridge of the hill, and corresponded nearly to the Vie del Quirinale
and Venti Settembre. There were many temples on the Quirinal, and
it became one of the principal residence districts for the wealthy (cf.
DoMus), while a very large portion of its entire area was occupied still
later by the baths of Diocletian (for the complete topography and monuments of the Quirinal, see <bibl>RhM 1894, 379-423</bibl>; HJ 394-443; P1. 484-506;

<p>(templum, Cic. Fest. Cur.; templa, Ovid; <foreign xml:lang="greek">nao/s</foreign>, Cass. Dio):
a temple on the Quirinal hill, to which it gave the name (Fest. 255), said
to have been vowed by L. Papirius Cursor when dictator in <date value="-325">325 B.C.</date>, and
dedicated in 293 by his son, who adorned it with a profusion of spoils
(<bibl>Liv. x. 46</bibl>. 7; Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 213</bibl>). After the Romulus legend was developed and he was identified with Quirinus, the building of the temple
was said to have been commanded by Romulus when he appeared to
Proculus Julius (Cic. de re pub. ii. 20; de leg. i. 3; Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 511</bibl> 
de vir. ill. 2. 14). The record of a session of the senate held in aede
Quirini in <date value="-435">435 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. iv. 21</bibl>. 9) is regarded as fictitious, but in any
case the temple was one of the oldest in Rome (Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 120</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">inter
antiquissima delubra habetur Quirini</foreign>). Whether it stood on the site of
an earlier ara (see above) cannot be determined. In front of it grew
two myrtle trees, called patricia and plebeia, of which the former flourished
as long as the senate retained its power unimpaired, but withered away
during the Social war, while the other became healthy and vigorous
(Plin. loc. cit.).
<pb n="439"/></p>
<p>In <date value="-206">206 B.C.</date> the temple was struck by lightning (Liv. xxviii. II. 4),
and again in 49 when it was much injured if not almost destroyed (Cass.
<bibl>Dio xli. 14</bibl>. 3). It must have been repaired almost at once, for the
senate erected in it in 45 a statue to Caesar as the <foreign xml:lang="greek">*qeo\s a)ni/khtos</foreign> (Cass. <bibl>Dio
xliii. 45</bibl>. 3). A final restoration was completed by Augustus in <date value="-16">16 B.C.</date>
(Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 5</bibl>; <bibl>vi. 32</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 19</bibl>. 4).  The day of dedication
of the original temple was not 29th June, the later date (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi.
795-796</bibl>; Fast. Venus. ad in Kal. Mart., CIL i. p. 212, 250; Wissowa,
Ges. Abh. 144-146, 268-270), but 17th February. Mommsen's view
(CIL ia. p. 310) has been proved to be correct by the discovery of the pre-Caesarian calendar at Antium, where we find the Quirinalia entered on
17th February (<bibl>NS 1921, 87</bibl>). The 29th of June, on the other hand, was
only added to the calendar by Caesar. The same calendar, like that of
the Arvales (CIL i². p. 326), records another festival of Quirinus on
23rd August, and (apparently; it is fragmentary at that point) of Hora
Quirini also (<bibl>NS 1921, 109</bibl>).</p>
<p>The temple was of the Doric order, dipteral-octostyle, with a pronaos,
and a porch in the rear. It had seventy-six columns, two rows of fifteen
each on the sides, and a double row of eight at each end, counting those
on the sides again, and was surrounded by a porticus (<bibl>Vitr. iii. 2</bibl>. 7;
Mart. xi. I. 9). A relief of the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Others (HF 1418; Sieveldng in Festschrift fir P. Arndt, 136) assign it to the Flavian

</note> found within the area of
the baths of Diocletian, represents the facade of this temple as that of a
Doric tetrastyle, with Romulus and Remus taking the auspices on the
pediment (<bibl>Mitt. 1904, 27-29</bibl>, 157-158; <bibl>SScR i. 72-74</bibl>; PT 229). Occasional references to it are found in literature (<bibl>Vitr. vii. 9</bibl>. 4; <bibl>Liv.
viii. 20</bibl>. 8; Plut. Cam. 20; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 9975</bibl>), down to the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>
(Cur. Reg. VI, om. Not.; cf. <bibl>CIL vi. 903</bibl> =31895). Its site is determined
by the discovery of inscriptions to be on the north side of the Alta Semita
and probably in the eastern part of the present gardens of the royal
palace, near the edge of the hill (<bibl>CIL vi. 475</bibl>, 565 <note anchored="true" place="foot">565 = i2. 803; ILS 3141.

It is also said
to have been the house of the pontifex maximus (Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. viii.
363</bibl>: domus enim  in qua pontifex habitat regia dicitur, quod in ea
rex sacrificulus habitare consuesset, sicut flaminia domus in qua flamen
habitat, dicebatur (the italicised words are interpolated); cf. <bibl>Jord.
i. 2</bibl>. 299); and of the rex sacrorum  (Serv. loc. cit.; <bibl>ii. 57</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">flaminia
autem domus flaminis dicitur sicut regia regis domus</foreign>; Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 27</bibl>,
where Augustus is said to have given the house of the rex to the
Vestals because it adjoined theirs; Fest. 279: regia domus ubi rex
habitat). This latter statement, however, is the result of confusion
between rex and rex sacrorum (Jord. cit.), for the domus regis sacrorum
or sacrificuli was on the Velia and had no connection with the regia
(Fest. 293: <foreign xml:lang="la">ne eatenus quidem  sacra (via) appellanda est a regia ad
domum regis sacrificuli sed etiam a regis domo ad sacellum  Streniae</foreign>).
On the other hand, the regia could not have been the dwelling-house of
the pontifex maximus, for in historical times it was a consecrated fanum
containing sacraria (Fest. 278:<foreign xml:lang="la"> (Regia). . .quod in fanum a pon(tifice)
.. . tant quod in ea sa(cra fiunt quaedam a rege sol&gt;ita usurpari</foreign>; cf. 329).
The actual house of the pontifex was probably the domus publica, in
the precinct of the Atrium Vestae (Suet. Caes. 46; Cass.  <bibl>Dio liv. 24</bibl>;
RE i. A. 466), until Augustus transferred this residence to the Palatine
(Van Deman, The Atrium Vestae 11, 12, 13).</p>
<p>During the republic, therefore, the regia was the official headquarters
of the pontifex maximus, and its position, directly north-west of the
aedes Vestae, is made certain by the existing ruins (cf. Hor. <bibl>Carm. i. 2</bibl>. 15:
<pb n="441"/>
<foreign xml:lang="la">vidimus flavum  Tiberim... ire deiectum  monumenta regis templaque
Vestae</foreign>). In it was a shrine of Mars, sacrarium Martis, in which were
kept the hastae and  ancilia of that god (Serv. <bibl>Aen. vii. 188</bibl>, 603;
<bibl>viii. 3</bibl>; <bibl>Gell. iv. 6</bibl>. 1, 2; Cass. <bibl>Dio xliv. 7</bibl> ; Iul. Obs. 6. 36, 44, 44 a, 47,

Kal. <bibl>Sept. vi. 32482</bibl>, CIL i². p. 237; WR 203, 502).  Certain sacrifices are recorded as having been performed in the regia (<bibl>Varro vi. 12</bibl>;
Fest. 329; <bibl>Macrob. i. 15</bibl>. 19, 16. 30), a sheep was offered to Janus on
9th January by the rex sacrorum (CIL i². p. 306), and the blood of the
October horse was sprinkled on its hearth and the head fastened on its
wall (Fest. 178; Plut. q. Rom. 97; cf. Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 24</bibl>; and see
<bibl>BC 1920, 152-162</bibl>). The archives of the pontifices were probably kept
here, for the tablets from which the annales maximi were edited, were
hung on the outer wall of the building (Cic. de leg. i. 2. 6 ; <bibl>Gell. ii. 28</bibl>. 6;
<bibl>Dionys. i. 76</bibl>. 3), and it was the place of assembly of the college of pontiffs
(Plin. Ep. iv. II. 6; Cic. ad <bibl>Att. x. 3</bibl> a, I; WR 503), and at times of the
Fratres Arvales (<bibl>CIL vi. 2023</bibl>. 9). <ref target="atrium-regium" n="U">ATRIUM REGIUM</ref> (q.v.) is referred to
the regia by <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 380, and Toeb. 3.</p>
<p>The regia was burned and restored in <date value="-148">148 B.C.</date> (Obseq. 19; Liv. epit.
Oxyrh. 127-129; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 407</bibl> (for a possible burning by the Gauls in
<date value="-390">390 B.C.</date>, see Mem. Am. <bibl>Acad. ii. 59-60</bibl>)); and again in <date value="-36">36 B.C.</date>, when
the restoration was carried out by Cn. Domitius Calvinus who created a
building, small but of unusual beauty (Cass. <bibl>Dio xlviii. 42</bibl>; cf. Plin. <bibl>NH
xxxiv. 48</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 1301</bibl> ; <bibl>EE iii. 266</bibl>). The evidence of the ruins shows
that the statement of Tacitus (<bibl>Ann. xv. 41</bibl>) that the regia was destroyed
in the fire of Nero is greatly exaggerated (for possible injury by the
great fire in Commodus' reign, see <bibl>Herodian i. 14</bibl>. 3). The building is
represented on a fragment of the Marble Plan (21), and is mentioned in
the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange> (Solin. loc. cit.) and probably in the fourth (<bibl>CIL vi. 511</bibl>).</p>
<p>The existing ruins belong to three periods, the republican, the early
imperial and the mediaeval. Of the superstructure of the first two
periods almost nothing remains except the lowest courses of some of the
walls and  many  architectural fragments. The republican  remains
are found only in the foundations of the imperial structure, the ground
plan of which is practically identical.</p>
<p>There are traces of the repairs of 148, while the walls of cappellaccio
probably date from well before the fire of <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date> After the restoration
of Calvinus the regia was shaped like an irregular pentagon, filling the
space between the Sacra via, the temenos of Vesta, and the temple of
Julius Caesar, and consisting of parts unsymmetrically joined together.
The principal part was trapezoidal, with a mean length of about 22 metres
<pb n="442"/>
and a width of 8 metres, and was built of solid blocks of white marble,
with a pavement of marble slabs.  Some fragments of the cornice in
this material are preserved.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> They belong to the restoration of Calvinus (Toeb. cit.; ASA 23, 45), though they have
hitherto been wrongly attributed to the period of Diocletian. Compare the similar cornices
of the Templum Divi luli and the temple of Saturn and the Capitolium at Terracina (Forma
Italiae, I. i. I. 84). For the Doric fragments generally attributed to the Regia, see <ref target="arcus-augusti" n="U">ARCUS AUGUSTI</ref>.
</note> On the west and south sides were inscribed
in four double panels the fasti consulares, and on the pilasters of the
south side, the fasti triumphales, and many of the fragments of these
blocks have been preserved and are now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori
(<bibl>Mitt. 1904, 117-123</bibl>;  <bibl>1905, 77-80</bibl>; <bibl>NS  1904, 8-10</bibl>;  <bibl>1925, 376-382</bibl>;

<p>The interior was divided into three rooms, in the largest of which
was found a pavement of Anio tufa blocks (perhaps therefore post-Sullan),
and in this a circular substructure of grey tufa, 2.53 metres in diameter,
dating from  the early period.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> This circular substructure has sometimes been identified with the sacrarium Martis,
being considered as the base of a conical chamber in which the spears were hung-a kind
of primitive seismograph (Atti cit. infra) ; but it has recently been interpreted as the ancient
hearth of the Regia (<bibl>Mitt. 1921, 19-21</bibl>).
</note>  There was a doorway in the original
building, but it was roughly widened for the mediaeval house, and two
rude steps placed in front of it.</p>
<p>The irregular space between this part of the regia and the Sacra via
was occupied by an open court, with a covered ante-chamber at the east
end, where the main entrance seems to have been. The greatest width,
north and south, of the area of the regia was about 27 metres, and the
least about 12 metres. The court was paved with slabs of marble, and
in it are two wells and a cistern, which may date from a very early time,
though Frank assigns the greater age to the main (trapezoidal) building,
and contained fragments of various kinds. Near the cistern is a base
of tufa blocks, with traces of a circular superstructure. To this may
belong the round block of peperino with the inscription A. COVRI (<dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second
century B.C.</dateRange>).<note anchored="true" place="foot"> A fragment of a puteal was also found, bearing the name REGIA <bibl>(CIL ij. 1007, 1008)</bibl>.
</note> At the south-west end of the marble building is a small
room, and near this in the wall was found the inscription (<bibl>NS 1899, 128</bibl>)
of the <ref target="schola-kalatorum-pontificum" n="U">SCHOLA KALATORUM</ref>  (q.v.), but no identification of any of the
existing divisions of the ruins with any of the parts of the ancient regia
mentioned in classical literature is possible.</p>
<p>In the <dateRange from="600" to="699">seventh</dateRange> or <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange> the regia was transformed into
a private house, the traces of which are visible in all parts of the area,

<p> the four regions-Suburana, Esquilina, Collina,
Palatina-into which the city, within the pomerium, was divided during
the republic (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 45</bibl>). Tradition ascribed to Servius Tullius
(<bibl>Liv. i. 43</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. iv. 14</bibl>; de vir. ill. 7; Fest. 368) the division of the
inhabitants of Rome into four tribus, which, while purely a political division so far as our knowledge goes, are usually supposed to have been based
on the earlier local division described by Varro. This city of the Four
Regions (text fig. 5) was a stage of development intermediate between
the Palatine settlement (or the Septimontium) and what is ordinarily
<pb n="444"/>
called the Servian city, a stage that was the result of the union of the
Palatine and Esquiline settlements, that is shown by archaeological
evidence to have taken place about the <date value="-650">middle of the seventh century B.C.</date>
(Mon. <bibl>L. xv. 764</bibl>). The division into four regions remained in force
until the reorganisation of Augustus.</p>
<p>All the area within the <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref> (q.v.) was included in the regions
except, apparently, the Capitoline, perhaps because this hill was always
regarded as the citadel and religious centre of the city, and not as a
local division. Our knowledge of the area of the regions is derived principally from Varro's description (<bibl>LL v. 46-54</bibl>) of the location of the sacraria
of the <ref target="argeorum-sacraria" n="U">ARGEI</ref> (q.v.), a description based quite certainly on documents
which represented the topographical conditions of the <dateRange from="-299" to="-200">third century B.C.</dateRange>
His incomplete and somewhat obscure account distributes twenty-seven
sacraria among the four regions, eleven of which can be located with
reasonable certainty, and thirteen are conjectural, while three are wholly
unknown. The outer boundary of the regions was the pomerium, which
coincided with the Servian wall down to the time of Sulla, except that
the Aventine was excluded. <rs key="regio1" type="region">Region I</rs>, Suburana, comprised the Sucusa,
Ceroliensis and Caelius, according to the generally accepted view, although
this is a matter of sharp dispute (see literature cited below) ; II, Esquilina,
the Oppius and Cispius; III, Collina, the Quirinal and the Viminal;
IV, Palatina, the Palatium, Velia and Cermalus. It is not possible to
draw the inner boundaries of these regions with exactness, nor is it certain
that all four met at a common point, near the Velia, as is sometimes
maintained.</p>
<p>The discussion of the four regions involves that of the Argei, and the
literature of the subject includes both topics to a greater or less degree.

<p> * the fourteen regions, or wards, into which
Augustus divided the city when he reformed the municipal administration
in <date value="-7">7 B.C.</date> (Suet. Aug. 30; Cass. Dio Iv. 8). Thereafter Rome was often
designated as urbs regionum xiv or urbs sacra regionum xiv (text fig. 4).
These regions were divided into vici, and a new set of magistrates,
magistri vicorum, drawn from  the common citizens, was instituted,
originally four from each vicus, but afterwards forty-eight from each
region regardless of the number of vici, and two curatores. These
magistrates had to do mainly with the religious ceremonies of the regions,
while the regular municipal administration was still in the hands of
higher officials. (For the administrative organisation of the regions, see
<pb n="445"/>
Marquardt, <bibl>Staatsverwaltung iii. 203-207</bibl>; Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsrecht ii. 1035</bibl>-
1037; <bibl>iii. 119-122</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1906, 198-208</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 975</bibl>.)  The regions were
fourteen in number, twice as many as the traditional hills of Rome, and
were known originally only by number (cf. Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 40</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH iii.
66-67</bibl>; Hist. Aug. Heliog. 20; Frontinus 79; Suet. Dom. I; CIL vi. pass.),
but the names found in the Regionary Catalogue became current at
various later periods, doubtless as a result of popular usage <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Hulsen notes that these names occur in no ancient writer, in no official document or
inscription, and not even in any sepulchral inscription: and he is therefore inclined to
believe that they were simply the first names in each region in the original list, from which
the Notitia and Curiosum were taken, and then were placed by careless editing at the head
of the list of buildings in each region. It is further to be noted that, even when they are
those of buildings, they are not repeated in these lists.
</note> (cf. <ref target="palatinus-mons" n="U">REGIO-PALATII</ref>, <ref target="campus-martius" n="U">REGIO CAMPI MARTII</ref>, Suet. Caes. 39, Aug. 5, Nero 12, de gramm.
2; and <ref target="pax-templum" n="U">TEMPLUM PACIS</ref> for <rs key="regio4" type="region">Region IV</rs>, which could not have been used
at all until after that building was erected by Vespasian.) This division
into fourteen regions continued in force until the <dateRange from="600" to="699">seventh century</dateRange> when
an ecclesiastical division into seven regions was introduced and opened
the way for the entirely different organisation of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>From the Regionary Catalogue it is possible to determine with some
precision, in most cases, the limits of these regions in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>,
but it is a different matter to do this for the Augustan division, inasmuch
as it is certain that the outer boundaries at least had been extended
at some points during the intervening three hundred years, and our
additional information concerning earlier conditions is extremely scanty.
What little there is must be derived from (1) the evidence of terminal
cippi that have been found as to successive extensions of the <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref>
(q.v.) under Claudius, Vespasian and Hadrian; (2) Pliny's description
(<bibl>NH iii. 66-67</bibl>) of the area of the city in his day-a passage full of difficulty
and uncertainty; (3) the customs boundary of the city, marked by cippi,
of which five have been found, dating from the time of Commodus (<bibl>CIL
vi. 1016</bibl> a, b, c, 8594, 31227)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Four of them are marked ABCD in text fig. 4 (p. 394).
</note> ; (4) the list of vici on the so-called Capitoline
Base, inscribed in <date value="136">136 A.D.</date> (<bibl>CIL vi. 975</bibl>; <bibl>Jord. ii. 585-598</bibl>). The line
of the Servian wall was not always a boundary between adjacent regions,
for while <rs key="regio3" type="region">III</rs>, <rs key="regio4" type="region">IV</rs>, <rs key="regio8" type="region">VIII</rs>, <rs key="regio11" type="region">XI</rs> appear to have always been limited by that
line on the inside, and the same was true of <rs key="regio5" type="region">V</rs>, <rs key="regio7" type="region">VII</rs>, <rs key="regio9" type="region">IX</rs> on the outside,
<rs key="regio1" type="region">I</rs>, <rs key="regio2" type="region">II</rs>, <rs key="regio6" type="region">VI</rs>, <rs key="regio12" type="region">XII</rs>, <rs key="regio13" type="region">XIII</rs> embraced ground on both sides. Nor did the wall
of Aurelian and the Augustan or later outer boundaries everywhere
coincide.</p>
<p>The following short description of the regions is based on the latest
and most generally accepted view  of their boundaries, as drawn by
Hulsen (KH ii.).</p>
<p><rs key="regio1" type="region">I</rs>, Porta Capena, so called from the gate in the Servian wall, an
irregularly shaped district, beginning at the east corner of the Palatine,
bounded on the west by that hill, and running south to some distance
<pb n="446"/>
beyond the porta Capcna between two lines not more than 150 metres
apart on the average. Beyond the Aventine it widened considerably
and extended to the bank of the Almo, some distance beyond the Aurelian
wall. It is possible that Regions <rs key="regio1" type="region">I</rs>, <rs key="regio2" type="region">II</rs>, <rs key="regio3" type="region">III</rs>, <rs key="regio4" type="region">IV</rs> and <rs key="regio10" type="region">X</rs> all met at one point
near the Meta Sudans.</p>
<p><rs key="regio2" type="region">II</rs>, Caelimontium, including most of the Caelian, and bounded by
<rs key="regio1" type="region">Region I</rs>, the Aurelian wall, and the straight street that ran from the
Colosseum to the porta Caelimontana and the porta Asinaria.</p>
<p><rs key="regio3" type="region">III</rs>, Isis et Serapis, so called because of the temples to these two
Egyptian deities erected within its area. It included the Colosseum
valley and the Oppius, and was bounded by <rs key="regio2" type="region">Region II</rs>, the Servian wall,
the clivus Suburanus from the porta Esquilina west, and the prolongation
of its line westward to a point north of the Colosseum, where it turned
south to the Meta Sudans. This line from the porta Esquilina was the
southern limit of <rs key="regio4" type="region">Region IV</rs>.</p>
<p><rs key="regio4" type="region">IV</rs>, Templum Pacis (see above), including the Sacra via from its
beginning to the atrium Vestae, the Subura, and the Cispius. Its boundaries were that just described, the Servian wall, the vicus Patricius
from the porta Viminalis to a point near the Subura, where it seems to
have curved to the north, then passed between the forum of Nerva and
that of Vespasian, and embraced the northern part of the forum.</p>
<p><rs key="regio5" type="region">V</rs>, Esquiliae, the eastern district of the city, lying outside the Servian
wall and north of the via Asinaria. In the time of Augustus the campus
Viminalis, and probably all the district between the via Tiburtina and
the via Salaria, lay outside the city (Plin. loc. cit.), and none of it was
included in <rs key="regio5" type="region">Region V</rs> until after the time of Vespasian. The boundary
was about 300-400 metres beyond the Aurelian wall on the south (<bibl>Mitt.
1896, 122-130</bibl>), but in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> coincided with it from a point
south of the via Labicana to the south side of the castra Praetoria.</p>
<p><rs key="regio6" type="region">VI</rs>, Alta Semita, so called from a street that followed the ridge of the
Quirinal, like the present Via Venti Settembre. Bounded on the south and
south-west by <rs key="regio4" type="region">Region IV</rs> it originally included the Quirinal from the
imperial fora to the Servian wall between the porta Viminalis and the
porta Collina, and extended far enough west to take in the horti Sallustiani,
and north beyond the line of the Aurelian wall. In the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>,
after the castra Praetoria had been made a part of the city, the boundary
of this region coincided with the Aurelian wall from the porta Salaria
south round the castra. From a point a little west of the porta Pinciana,
the boundary ran almost due south to the forum of Trajan.</p>
<p><rs key="regio7" type="region">VII</rs>, Via Lata, so called from the name given to the southern end of
the via Flaminia, between which and the western boundary of <rs key="regio6" type="region">VI</rs> this
region lay.</p>
<p><rs key="regio8" type="region">VIII</rs>, Forum Romanum vel Magnum, an irregular region, including
the forum, though not the whole of the Sacra via, the imperial fora, the
Capitol, and the district south of it, extending to a line drawn north
<pb n="447"/>
of the forum Boarium through the Velabrum and to the east end of the
atrium Vestae.</p>
<p><rs key="regio9" type="region">IX</rs>, Circus Flaminius, including all the territory between the Servian
wall, the via Flaminia and the Tiber.</p>
<p><rs key="regio10" type="region">X</rs>, Palatium, the Palatine, within the lines described by Tacitus
(<bibl>Ann. xii. 24</bibl>) as those of the first <ref target="pomerium" n="U">POMERIUM</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p><rs key="regio11" type="region">XI</rs>, Circus Maximus, a very irregular region, containing the circus
Maximus, and bounded by the Tiber, and Regions <rs key="regio9" type="region">IX</rs>, <rs key="regio8" type="region">VIII</rs>, <rs key="regio10" type="region">X</rs>,<rs key="regio12" type="region">XII</rs> and
XIII.</p>
<p><rs key="regio12" type="region">XII</rs>, Piscina Publica, so called from a district within its limits that had
formerly contained a public reservoir or swimming bath. This region
included the eastern part of the Aventine, and was bounded by the via
Appia and Region I, the Aurelian wall, and the vicus portae Raudusculanae and the vicus Piscinae Publicae.</p>
<p><rs key="regio13" type="region">XIII</rs>, Aventinus, the Aventine and the district south of it, between
the boundaries of <rs key="regio12" type="region">XII</rs> and <rs key="regio11" type="region">XI</rs>, the Aurelian wall, and the Tiber.</p>
<p><rs key="regio14" type="region">XIV</rs>, Trans Tiberim (Trastevere), all the city on the right bank of
the Tiber, together with the insula Tiberina. The limits of this region
cannot be determined, but it included much more than the territory
within the Aurelian wall. It extended south as far as the temple of <ref target="fors-fortuna-fanum" n="U">FORS
FORTUNA</ref> (q.v.) and north far enough to include the Vatican district.</p>

<p> a locality connected with the Remus legend. According to
what is probably the earliest form of the tradition (<bibl>Dionys. i. 85</bibl>; orig.
gent. Rom. 23), it was a hill near the Tiber, five miles down stream from
the Palatine, where Remus wished to build the future city, and where
he was buried (<bibl>Dionys. i. 87</bibl>). The same tradition is preserved in Festus
(276): <foreign xml:lang="la">Remurinus ager dictus quia possessus est a Remo, et habitatio

<p>Uncertainty as to the place where Remus took the auspices is seen
in the words of Festus, following those just quoted: <foreign xml:lang="la">sed et locus in
summo Aventino Remoria dicitur, ubi Remus de urbe condenda fuerat
auspicatus</foreign>, and in Dionysius (i. 86), where we read that some believed
the Aventine was the place appointed, others the Remoria.
<pb n="448"/></p>
<p>Finally, in Plutarch's version (Rom. 9, 11), the highest part of the
Aventine is the auguraculum and burial place of Remus, but under
the names <foreign xml:lang="greek">(*remw/nion, (*remw/nia, </foreign> or,'as it is now called,'<foreign xml:lang="greek">(*rigna/rion</foreign>(HJ 174).
Whatever the connection between these variants may be, in historical
times Remoria was a part of the eastern Aventine near S. Balbina, and
was apparently identified with Saxum, 'The Rock,' the spot where
Remus took the auspices (Cic. de domo 136; Ov. <bibl>Fast. v. 148-150</bibl>; cf.

taken to fix Roma quadrata in the <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">AREA PALATINA</ref> (q.v.). We may note
that a number of dedications to early deities, Anabestas, Marspiter,
Remuriene (CIL i². 969-971 vi. 21, 487, 566=30794) and the elogium
of Fertor <bibl>(CIL i². p. 202 n. xli.=vi. 1302)</bibl>, all of them archaistic inscriptions, perhaps of the time of Claudius, which have been connected, not
unnaturally, with the site of Roma quadrata, were also found between
the summa Sacra via and the mediaeval ruins which were formerly
believed to belong to the temple of Jupiter Stator, but have since been
excavated by Boni, and ascertained to be the foundations of two towers,
which he conjectures to be the <foreign xml:lang="la">Turres Cencii, domnae Bonae et Unquitatis</foreign> <bibl>(Iniquitatis ? in which Pope Gelasius II was imprisoned in 1118)</bibl>,
which were demolished by Calixtus II in <date value="1119">1119</date> (<bibl>LPD ii. 323</bibl>, 324, n. 18).
The foundations of a triumphal arch also came to light (see <ref target="arcus-domitiani-2" n="U">ARCUS
DOMITIANI (2)</ref>). A statue of the <dateRange from="-499" to="-300">fifth-fourth century B.C.</dateRange> (perhaps of
the school of Timotheus) which has generally been interpreted as a
Victory, was also found here (<bibl>AJA 1918, 347</bibl>); but the lack of wings is
against the identification (DAP 2. xiv. 235-239).</p>
<p>As we have seen, the site of the <ref target="area-palatina" n="U">AREA PALATINA</ref> (q.v.) has been
generally connected with that of Roma quadrata (2); but inasmuch
as the latter is stated by Festus to be ante templum Apollinis, it is difficult
to find a place for it if we accept (as on other grounds we are probably
right in doing) the theory of Pinza and Richmond as to the latter.
Richmond's attempt to locate the area in front of the temple, and Lugli's
placing of it to one side (ZA 175-176) do not seem successful. It may
indeed be better to accept Reid's and Leopold's idea ' that the name
Roma quadrata, as restricted to the mundus, is a purely antiquarian
invention' (<bibl>YW 1914, 12-13</bibl>) founded only on Plutarch.</p>
<p>During the ludi saeculares of <date value="204">204 A.D.</date> a tribunal was erected 'ad
Romam  quadratam' for the distribution of suffimenta (incense); see
<bibl>CIL vi. 32327</bibl>. As another was erected in area Apollinis, it is probable
that Roma quadrata was at a little distance from it (HJ 43). See the

20</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. viii. 14</bibl>. 12). It was situated on the south side of the Comitium
in front of the Curia Hostilia (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 155</bibl>; <bibl>Diodor. xii. 26</bibl>; Ascon.
in Milon. 12: <foreign xml:lang="la">ad comitium prope iuncta Curiae</foreign>; cf. Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 212</bibl>)
in close connection with the <ref target="sep-romuli-1" n="U">SEPULCRUM ROMULI</ref> (q.v.), i.e. between the
Comitium  and forum, so that the speaker could address the people
assembled in either. It is spoken of as the most prominent place in the

Dionys. <bibl>Hal. i. 87</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="greek">e)n tw=| krati/stw| xwri/w| para\ toi=s e)mbo/lois</foreign>). It was consecrated as a templum (<bibl>Liv. ii.

(Cic. <bibl>Phil. ix. 16</bibl>) in such numbers that at times they had to be removed
to make way for others (<bibl>Liv. iv. 17</bibl>; <bibl>viii. 13</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 23-25</bibl>;
<bibl>Velleius ii. 61</bibl>, etc.); while the <ref target="columna-rostrata-c-duilii-2" n="U">COLUMNA ROSTRATA C. DUILII</ref> (q.v.)
stood on or close by it.</p>
<p>The name rostra vetera is only used in Suet. Aug. 100:<foreign xml:lang="la"> bifariam
laudatus est, pro aede divi Iulii a Tiberio et pro rostris veteribus a Druso</foreign>;
where it refers to the rostra transferred by Caesar to the north-west end
of the forum in contradistinction to the rostra at the temple of Divus
Iulius; though it is commonly and conveniently used to signify the
republican rostra in contradistinction to the rostra of Caesar.</p>
<p>Excavations in the Comitium have brought to light remains which
must be attributed to the republican rostra, though much doubt attaches
to their exact interpretation. 'It would appear that about the middle
of the <dateRange from="-499" to="-400">fifth century B.C.</dateRange> the Comitium was separated from the forum
by a low platform, upon which stood the archaic cippus, the cone, and
<pb n="451"/>
probably an earlier monument, represented by the existing sacellum.
After the fire that followed the Gallic invasion, the first platform was
replaced by a higher, to which a straight flight of steps led up from the
second level of the <ref target="comitium" n="U">COMITIUM</ref> (q.v.). A wall, 3 metres in front of these
steps, perhaps formed part of the rostra (Hulsen in <bibl>Mitt. 1905, 29-32</bibl>
and pl. ii.-the best plan available of the rostra of both periods; cf. also
HC pl. v.). In this platform was an irregular space, bounded by walls
on each side, enclosing the monuments in question. Whether remains
of the platform of this period exist, or whether the cappellaccio slabs
which have been attributed to it are really the bedding for the tufa
slabs of the next period, is a moot point. According to another theory,
a kerb along the northern edge of the cappellaccio pavement in front of
the basilica Aemilia marked the front line of the original rostra (<bibl>CR 1901,
138</bibl>; <bibl>JRS 1922, 7</bibl>).</p>
<p>There is no trace of any alteration in the rostra corresponding with
the third level of the Comitium; but in correspondence with the fourth
we have a reconstruction of the rostra on a new plan. 'Its remains
consist (I) of a curved structure of large blocks of Monte Verde tufa,
forming two steps about 35 cm. high, which rested on a foundation of
cappellaccio (grey) tufa 15 cm. high; (2) of a low corridor or canalis,
1 metre wide and about 75 cm. high, parallel to the curved line of the steps
and about 9 metres from them; (3) of a platform, or suggestus, to the
west of the niger lapis, and (4) of a row of shafts, or pozzi, running east
and west, about 6.75 metres distant from the platform. The portion
of the platform ... .on which the curved flight of steps rested, lay about
one metre above the floor of the Comitium.' It has a fine pavement of
Monte Verde tufa, along the front of which runs a raised kerb. According
to one view these monuments are attributable to the period of Sulla
(<bibl>JRS 1922, 21-25</bibl> ; <bibl>Mitt. 1905, 32-39</bibl>; TF 61-66). Whether the 'Tomb
of Romulus ' was hidden from view at this period or later, is uncertain.</p>
<p>The curved front of the rostra, as represented by the canalis with
the beaks of ships with which it was adorned, is held to be represented in
a coin of <date value="-45">45 B.C.</date> of Lollius Palikanus (HC p. 69, fig. 26; BM. <bibl>Rep. i. 517</bibl>,
4011-3). The arcade at the back of the rostra Augusti, which Boni
(<bibl>NS 1900, 627-634</bibl>) has called the rostra Caesaris, belongs to the time of
Sulla, and is simply a low viaduct to support the <ref target="clivus-capitolinus" n="U">CLIVUS CAPITOLINUS</ref>
(q.v.) and a street branching off from it (P1. 227-228; <bibl>CR 1901, 87-89</bibl>;

<p> the rostra of the imperial period, situated at the north-

</note> If we consider the point at which Caesar's
body was burnt, it will seem natural that Mark Antony's oration should
have been delivered at the opposite end of the forum (cf. Senec. Dial.
iii. I. 3: <foreign xml:lang="la">a rostris usque ad arcum Fabianum</foreign> to express the whole length
of the forum). Augustus completed them  (Pomponius, <bibl>Dig. i. 2</bibl>. 2)
and he is represented seated on the rostra in a coin (Cohen, Aug. 529
=BM. Aug. 115=HC p. 75, fig. 32). A funeral oration in honour of
Augustus was delivered from  this rostra by Drusus (Suet. Aug. 100,
where it is called vetera in contradistinction to the Rostra aedis divi lulii).</p>
<p>Cassius Dio describes two magnificent ceremonies which took place
on the rostra, the reception of Tiridates by Nero and the funeral ceremony
of Pertinax (lvi. 34; <bibl>lxxxiv. 3</bibl>); cf. also Fronto ad <bibl>Antonin. i. 2</bibl>, p. 98,
Nab.; Mamertin. genethl. Maximian. 19; Prudentius, <bibl>Peristeph. xi. 45</bibl>;
Aur. Victor, epit. 19.</p>
<p>We know of the existence of statues in rostris of Augustus (Tac. <bibl>Ann.
iv. 67</bibl>), where he speaks of the rostra elliptically ' <foreign xml:lang="la">celeberrimo fori</foreign>,' just
as the old rostra had been called <foreign xml:lang="la">oculatissimus locus</foreign>; and even Ammianus
Marcellinus (xvi. 10. 13) calls it <foreign xml:lang="la">perspectissimum priscae potentiae locum</foreign>;
Claudius Gothicus (Hist. Aug. Claud. 3), and Stilicho (CILvi. 1731 = 1195<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. 31913 a.
</note>).
In a relief on the arch of Constantine (supra, p. 27) columns with statues
standing upon them are, as a fact, seen behind the rostra.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It is difficult to see how they could have stood on the rostra (as in HC 72), for the
foundations are not sufficiently massive to support them. For bookshops here, see Pseudo-
Acro ad Hor. <bibl>Epist. i. 20</bibl>. I.
</note></p>
<p>The existing remains of the rostra belong to four main periods: (1) that
of Caesar, the concrete core of whose rostra, 3.50 metres high, is preserved
for a length of over 13 metres, built against, and in all probability on
top of, the line of arches supporting the <ref target="clivus-capitolinus" n="U">CLIVUS CAPITOLINUS</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>(2) that of Augustus, who incorporated the core of the rostra of Caesar
in a larger and higher core, which served as the foundation for the curved
flight of steps on the west extending across the whole length of the
rostra, and forming a monumental approach to the platform  itself.
The front of this enlarged core was faced with a wall of the finest Augustan
brickwork; and a wall faced with the same material is to be found in the
foundations of the north side of the platform itself, and possibly in the
front also. The platform extended 10 metres forward from the western
brick wall, and its front was about 24 metres in length and 3 high. The
front and side walls are built of opus quadratum of tufa, faced with
marble; bronze beaks in two rows were let into this facing. These
walls have been restored by Boni up to their original height. The
travertine paving slabs of the platform  were supported by beams of
the same material resting on these walls and on three rows of travertine
<pb n="453"/>
piers, which were in later times partly replaced and partly strengthened
by brick piers and walls. A marble balustrade extended along the sides
and front, in the centre of which there was an opening.</p>
<p>The theory outlined above is confirmed by an interesting detail.
The plans of the central area of the forum (HC p. 139, fig. 69; ZA p. 83,
fig. 18) omit two more ' pozzi rituali ' of the line in the right bottom
portion, which take it down as far as the front of the original rostra of
Caesar. When the rostra were enlarged by Augustus, these two last
pozzi, together with the first shown in the plan, were suppressed, and a
new line created, which ran along the front of the new facade. (According
to the theory previously current, it was to Trajan that the rectangular
platform should be attributed.)</p>
<p>(3) that of Septimius Severus, in connection with the erection of
whose arch most of the north wall of the rostra was removed, the
north part of the back wall of brick-faced concrete cut down to the
level of the pavement, and the so-called hemicycle formed by cutting
back the brick-faced core of the steps for at least more than half its
length, so that its curve should correspond with that of the flight of
steps behind.</p>
<p>The northern half of the hemicycle was decorated with slabs of Porta
Santa marble, with pilasters of africano at intervals, and a plinth of
Pentelic marble, while a richly decorated curved cornice probably
belonged to a colonnade along the front of it (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 18</bibl>, fig. 3).
The work was not completed at the southern end. A small triangular
court was thus formed, from which steps led up to the platform (HC
p. 77, fig. 33); and this and the space under the rostra were paved
with tiles overlying an earlier pavement of herring-bone brickwork;
some of them bear stamps of the Severan period (<bibl>CIL xv. 405</bibl>). According
to an older theory, now generally abandoned, the hemicycle was the
Graecostasis of the time of Caesar (Nichols, Notizie dei Rostri), while
Mau held it to be his rostra (<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 230-266</bibl>; Richter, BRT ii.;
iv. ii; Delbrftck, Hellenist. Bauten, ii. 89; <bibl>BPW 1912, 1737</bibl>).</p>
<p>(4) that of about <date value="470">470 A.D.</date> (?), when the rectangular part of the
rostra was lengthened by a trapezoidal brick addition at the north end,
the facade of which was also decorated with beaks. An inscription
which ran the whole length of the enlarged platform  recorded a
restoration by the praefectus urbi, Junius Valentinus, in  honour
of Leo and Anthemius (?), possibly after a naval victory over the
Vandals.</p>
<p>The two marble balustrades or plutei which now stand in the open
area of the forum near the column of Phocas are generally supposed to
have formed part of the rostra, standing either on each side of the approach
or at the ends of the platform  (for the latter, see HC p. 74, fig. 31;
P1. p. 223, fig. 45). They were, as a fact, found where they now stand,
roughly erected on blocks of travertine (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>, p. 219, pi. iv. fig. 3).
<pb n="454"/>
They date, according to one view,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It was first brought forward by C. L. Visconti (Deux Actes de Domitien, etc.: cf.
<bibl>AJA 1910, 310-317</bibl>): but those who support it have not considered the improbability of
so conspicuous a monument of Domitian having survived his assassination.
</note> from the time of Domitian (so Cantarelli
in <bibl>BC 1889, 99-113</bibl>; <bibl>1900, 45</bibl>; <bibl>1920, 169</bibl>; cf. also SScR 138-142, 418);
but most authors refer them to Trajan,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Sieveking in Festschr. f. P. Arndt, 28, attributes them to the end of his reign.
</note> and explain them as representing
Trajan's charity in providing for the support of poor children, by investment of large sums in mortgages on farms, and the destruction by his
orders of the registers of taxes on inheritances already due. They have
recently been assigned to the reign of Hadrian and attributed to the
enclosure of the <ref target="statua-marsyae" n="U">STATUA MARSYAE</ref> (q.v.) : see <bibl>Mel. 1927, 154-183</bibl>.</p>
<p>To topographers they are interesting mainly for the representation
of the buildings of the forum in the background.</p>
<p>In the first relief (that facing down the forum) the emperor is seen
on the rostra in the foreground. Then comes the temple of Vespasian
(that of Concord was probably on the first section, which is lost), with six
Corinthian columns, then the temple of Saturn, with six Ionic columns,
and an arch of the Doric arcade of the Tabularium between them. Beyond
are the lower arcades of the basilica Iulia; while the statue of Marsyas
and a sacred fig-tree in an enclosure (both of which stood close by; see
<ref target="statua-marsyae" n="U">STATUA MARSYAE</ref>, <ref target="statua-marsyae" n="U">FICUS</ref>, <ref target="statua-marsyae" n="U">OLEA</ref>, <ref target="statua-marsyae" n="U">VITIS</ref>) terminate the picture, as they
begin the representation on the second relief, serving obviously as a
point de repkre. After them comes a series of arcades, like those on the
first relief, representing the basilica Aemilia; then the Argiletum; then
the Curia with a broad flight of steps in front of it (after its restoration
by Domitian), wrongly represented as having a facade of five columns;
and finally a triumphal arch, probably situated on the clivus Argentarius,
with the rostra in the foreground once more. The recurrence both of the
rostra and of the Marsyas shows that the two reliefs were intended to
form a complete circle; while the temple of Caesar and the temple of
Castor and Pollux, which are not represented, are precisely those which
the speaker would have had before his eyes. It is also to be noticed
that the reliefs on the other (outer) side of each pluteus, representing
the sheep, swine, and bull, the animals sacrificed in the suovetaurilia,
are on quite a different scale, and easily visible from the level of the
forum; whereas the reliefs on the inner side are on a much smaller scale,
and only visible from close by (<bibl>AJA 1901, 58-82</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 239-240</bibl>;
<bibl>1897, 326</bibl>; Petersen in Abh. A. v. Oettingen gewidmet <bibl>(1898)</bibl>, 130-143;
HC 97-102; ZA 75-76).  The relief of the suovetaurilia was imitated
on the base of a column erected close by to commemorate the decennalia of Diocletian (<bibl>CIL vi. 1204</bibl>), for the reliefs of which see <bibl>AJA 1914,
146-155</bibl>; SScR 317, 318; HC 95, 96.</p>
<p>The theory that the reliefs belonged to a monument erected in honour
of Trajan and represent only the buildings on the east side of the forum
<pb n="455"/>
is due to a misinterpretation of a passage of Pliny (Panegyr. 36; cf.
<bibl>BPW  1906, 221</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1906, 132</bibl>); while, according to another theory,
this monument stood near the tribunal praetoris, and the reliefs represent
the buildings on the west side of the forum (<bibl>AJA 1910, 310-317</bibl>).</p>

Sacra via (<foreign xml:lang="greek">h( i(era\ o(do/s</foreign>) was the correct and well-nigh universal form of
the name, and the reverse order, via Sacra, occurs, outside of poetry
(e.g. Hor. <bibl>Sat. i. 9</bibl>. 1), with extreme infrequency (Plin. <bibl>NH xix. 23</bibl>;
Not. Reg. IV; Suet. Vit. 17; Ascon. Cic. pro Mil. 14<note anchored="true" place="foot"> p. 23, § 45, in the edition of Kiessling and Schoell.
</note>; <bibl>CIL vi. 9239</bibl>,
9418, 9549). Further evidence for this is found in the word sacravienses
(Fest. 178), and in the protest raised by the grammarians against the
common practice of pronouncing the name as if it were a compound
(Fest. 290: <foreign xml:lang="la">nec ... appellari debere ait Verrius sed disiuncte, ut caeteras
vias Flaminiam  Appiam  Latinam, ut ne Novamviam  quidem, sed
Novam viam</foreign>).</p>
<p>The Sacra via proper began at the top of the Velia, where it was
called summa Sacra via, near the temple of the Lares (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 7</bibl>),
the house of the rex sacrorum (Fest. 290), the temple of Jupiter Stator
(Plut. Cic.  16:<foreign xml:lang="greek">I(drume/non e)n a)rxh=| th=s i(era=s o(dou= pro\s to\ *pala/tion a)nio/ntwn</foreign>)
and the later arch of Titus (Haterii relief, Mon. d. <bibl>Inst. v. 7</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> arcus in
sacra via summa</foreign>), and extended down to the east end of the forum, a point
variously designated as near the regia, the temple of Vesta, or the arch
of Fabius (Fest. 290; <bibl>Mart. i. 70</bibl>. 3-4; Cic. pro Plane. 17: <foreign xml:lang="la">si quando
iactor in turba, non illum accuso qui est in summa sacra via cum ego ad
Fabium  fornicem  impellor</foreign>; Varro, <bibl>RR i. 2</bibl>). Thrice in poetry (Hor.
<bibl>Carm. iv. 2</bibl>. 35; <bibl>Mart. i. 70</bibl>. 5; <bibl>iv. 78</bibl>. 7) this section seems to have been
called sacer clivus (see <ref target="clivus-sacer" n="U">CLIVUS SACER</ref>), and to go from the upper end to
the lower was called sacra via descendere (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 3</bibl>. 3; Asc. in
Scaur. 27; Hor. Epod. 7. 7), or deducere (Sail. Hist. ii. frg. 45). This
street, from the top of the Velia to the entrance to the forum, is the
Sacravia of all the sources, literary and epigraphical, down to the end of the
empire, with two exceptions, Varro (<bibl>LL v. 47</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Carinae postea Cerionia,
quod hinc oritur caput sacrae viae ab Streniae sacello quae pertinet in
arce(m), qua sacra quotquot mensibus feruntur in arcem  et per quam
augures ex arce profecti solent inaugurare. Huius sacrae viae pars haec
sola volgo nota quae est a foro eunti primore clivo</foreign>), and Festus (290:
<pb n="457"/>
<foreign xml:lang="la">Sacram viam quidam appellatam esse existimant quod in ea foedus ictum
sit inter Romulum ac Tatium: quidam quod eo itinere utantur sacerdotes
idulium  sacrorum  conficiendorum  causa. Itaque ne eatenus quidem,
ut vulgus opinatur, sacra appellanda est a regia ad domum regis sacrificuli, sed etiam a regis domo ad sacellum Streniae, et rusus a regia usque
in arcem</foreign>). It is evident that Varro-and Festus following his authority-
believed that the Sacra via owed its origin to the fact that it was the course
of religious processions, and supposed that the street began at the shrine
of <ref target="strenia-sacellum" n="U">STRENIA</ref> (q.v.), not mentioned elsewhere, but near the site of the
Colosseum, ascended the slope of the Velia, and after descending to
the regia, crossed the forum to the Capitol. This statement, however,
is disproved by what he himself adds about common usage. There is
therefore no reason for supposing that Sacra via ever meant more than
the street from the Velia to the regia (cf. Plin. <bibl>NH xix. 23</bibl> : <foreign xml:lang="la">mox Caesar
dictator totum forum Romanum intexit viamque sacram ab domo sua
et clivum usque in Capitolium</foreign>; Plut. Cic. 22: <foreign xml:lang="greek">kai\ prw=twn e)k *palati/ou paralabw\n to\n *le/ntlon h)=ge dia\ th=s i(era=s o(dou= kai\ th=s a)gora=s me/shs</foreign>),
although the term is now frequently used to include the stretch from
Colosseum to forum, and sometimes of that within the forum  also.
The explanations given by Varro and Festus (cf. also Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii.
641</bibl>) are unsatisfactory, and probably the street was called sacra
because on it stood the most sacred shrines of Rome, those of Vesta
and the Lares, as well as the dwellings of the Vestals, the pontifex
maximus and the rex sacrificulus (cf. Ov. Trist. iii. I. 28; Binder, Die
Plebs 62-64), although it may be that the street itself, from its position
and early importance, was regarded as something intrinsically sacred
(<bibl>Mitt. 1895, 162</bibl>).</p>
<p>The course and level (<bibl>AJA 1923, 390</bibl> sqq.) of the Sacra via varied
somewhat at different times. As it was the principal means of communication between the Palatine and the forum (Plut. Cic. 22; Tac.
<bibl>Hist. iii. 68</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxiv. 20</bibl>; <bibl>lxxvii. 4</bibl>), it probably began on the
summit of the Velia, near the porta Mugonia and the temple of Jupiter
Stator, and ran in a fairly straight line to the regia and temple of Vesta,
but just at what point it approached them  is not certain. After
the building of the fornix Fabianus in <date value="-121">121 B.C.</date> the street passed
through it.</p>
<p>We have but scanty remains of the Sacra via of the period of Sulla.
A street (which is perhaps the vicus Vestae) which diverged from it at
the fornix has been found under the temple of Julius Caesar and
the arch of Augustus, the pavement of which lies at 11.90 metres above
sea-level (<bibl>JRS 1922, 12-14</bibl>); and a few blocks exist of its pavement
below the steps at the north-east corner of the temple of Julius at 12.50
metres above sea-level. At the 'temple of Romulus' it lay at about
14 metres and at the divergence of the clivus Palatinus at about 27 metres
(<bibl>AJA 1923, 397-8</bibl>). For the remains of structures attributable to this
<pb n="458"/>
period (and to earlier times) along this portion of its course, mainly
shops and wells, see TF 87, 88.</p>
<p>After the rebuilding of the regia in <date value="-36">36 B.C.</date> and the building of the
temple of Divus Iulius a few years later, it passed to the north of these
structures, and then bent to the left to the temple of Castor (<bibl>Mart. i. 70</bibl>. 3-4:
<foreign xml:lang="la">vicinum  Castora canae transibis Vestae virgineamque domum</foreign>).  For
the early empire the line is definitely established by the discovery of the
Augustan pavement (Ills. 10, 45, 46), 5 metres wide, for a considerable part
of this distance, which shows that the street curved to the north just east
of the very top of the Velia, which it left very near the present arch of
Titus. It falls from a level of 28.30 metres above sea-level at a point
7 metres east of the arch of Titus to 12.60 metres at the north-east
corner of the temple of Julius. Some of this pavement has been found
under the steps of the temple of Venus and Roma (<bibl>AJA 1923, 399</bibl> sqq.-
and also for what follows).</p>
<p>Opposite the middle of the basilica of Constantine this Augustan
pavement is crossed by the massive concrete foundations of a series
of arcades of the time of Nero (<bibl>AJA 1923, 403</bibl> sqq.). These foundations
run in parallel lines, first south-east and then, turning at right angles,
south-west. This shows that Nero changed the line of the Sacra via,
in connection with the building of the DOMUS AUREA (q.v.), and made
it run between this portico and the one opposite it up to the vestibule
and then around the north-west corner of that building with a sharp
turn. On the north side of the Augustan pavement are the foundations
and walls of later private houses and buildings, which were destroyed
by the erection of arcades on this side also. The level at the east end
of the forum remained as before. At the temple of Romulus it was
about 16.70 metres above sea-level, in front of the basilica of Constantine
22.50 to 23.10, and at its junction with the clivus Palatinus about 27.60
metres. When Hadrian built the temple of Venus and Roma, some
further alterations in the street in front of it must have been made,
and thereafter the Sacra via from the Velia downwards to the regia
appears to have been an avenue, about 30 metres wide, flanked on both
sides by porticoes and shops, those on the north being finally destroyed
by the erection of the basilica of Constantine. It was this avenue that
was represented by the pavement, 23 metres wide including the side walks,
which was removed in 1899<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Even if the actual paving-stones could be shown to have been laid in the Middle Ages,
it would of course prove nothing against the road having originated in classical times: but
it was only by its removal that the excavation of the Augustan pavement was rendered
possible. Its level was at least 2 metres above the Sacra via of Nero.

Am. <bibl>Acad. v. 115-126</bibl>; see Ill. 7).</p>
<p>After the erection of the arch of Titus, the street passed through it
and continued eastward in a straight line to the Meta Sudans, between
the temple of Venus and Roma and the temple of Jupiter Stator and
the buildings on the slope of the Palatine. The Nova via joined the

<pb n="459"/>
Sacra via near the arch of Titus, and at about the same point the so-called
clivus Palatinus branched off the south and ascended the Palatine at
the porta Mugonia.</p>
<p>The Sacra via was also a residential quarter in regal and republican
times (<bibl>Gilb. iii. 360</bibl>), and those who dwelt here were called sacravienses
(Fest. 178). According to tradition, Numa, Ancus Martius and Tarquinius
Superbus lived here (<bibl>Solin. i. 21-23</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxiv. 29</bibl>), and Tullus Hostilius on the Velia (Cic. de rep. ii. 53). The houses of the <ref target="valerii-domus" n="U">VALERII</ref>
(q.v.) (<bibl>Liv. ii. 7</bibl>) and of Cn. Domitius Calvinus (Fest. 154) were in
summa Velia; and on the Sacra via itself were those of P. Scipio Nasica
(Pomp. <bibl>Dig. i. 2</bibl>. 2. 37), Tettius Damio (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 3</bibl>. 3), of the
Octavii (Sall. Hist. frg. ii. 45) and of the Domitii (<bibl>CIL vi. 2041</bibl>, 25;
2042 d, 32352). Many remains of these houses of the republican
period have been found (<bibl>Mitt. 1902, 94-95</bibl>; <bibl>1905, 118</bibl>) on the south
side of the street in front of the atrium  Vestae and farther east,
especially in the angle formed by the Nova via and clivus Palatinus.
Some of the ruins here are as late as the time of Augustus (<bibl>BPW 1905,
428</bibl>).</p>
<p>Like all the first streets in great cities, the Sacra via became in process
of time largely a street of shops (Ov. Ars <bibl>Am. ii. 265-266</bibl>; <bibl>Amor. i. 8</bibl>. 100;
<bibl>Prop. ii. 24</bibl>. 14-15; Richter, 163-164). At the beginning of the empire
it is probable that these shops stood on both sides of the way, from the
entrance to the forum to the Velia, but in consequence of the great changes
wrought by the erection of the forum Pacis, the templum Sacrae Urbis
and the temple of Faustina, they were gradually restricted for the most
part to the south side of the street between the atrium Vestae and the
arch of Titus. Many inscriptions have been found relating to the tradesmen of the Sacra via, especially jewellers of all sorts (<bibl>CIL vi. 9207</bibl>, 9221,
9239, 9418, 9419, 9545-9549), and those who dealt in flowers, fruit and
luxuries (vi. 9283, 9795, 9935).</p>
<p>Going eastward from the exit of the Sacra via from the forum area
between the temple of divus Iulius and the porticus Gai et Luci (<bibl>AJA
1913, 14-28</bibl>), the street passes on the north the temple of Faustina
(<date value="141">141 A.D.</date>), the archaic necropolis, the remains of private houses (HC
230-231; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 94</bibl>; <bibl>1905, 116</bibl>;  Atti 570-574), the Heroon
Romuli, and the basilica of Constantine; on the south the regia, the
remains of houses and shops between the street and the atrium Vestae,
and the great porticus (see above).</p>

<p> the building
which Caesar planned to erect (Cic. ad <bibl>Att. iv. 16</bibl>. 14) in place of the earlier
saepta (see <ref target="ovile" n="U">OVILE</ref>), the voting precinct in the campus Martius. It was
to be of marble, surrounded by a lofty porticus one mile in length.
Whether actually begun by Caesar or not, it was partly built by Lepidus
(<foreign xml:lang="greek">stoai=s pe/ric u(po\ tou= *lepi/dou pro\s ta\s fuletika\s a)rxairesi/as </foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="la">comitiis
tributis</foreign>) <foreign xml:lang="greek">sunw|kodomhme/na</foreign>, Cass. <bibl>Dio liii. 23</bibl>), and completed and dedicated
by Agrippa in <date value="-26">26 B.C.</date> Agrippa decorated the building with stone tablets
and paintings, and gave the official designation of saepta Iulia.  It
seems to have been ordinarily called saepta only; once porticus saeptorum
(Plin. <bibl>NH xvi. 201</bibl>); and once, in the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange>, saepta Agrippiana
(Hist. Aug. Alex. 26). It also continued to be known as ovile (<bibl>Liv.
xxvi. 22</bibl>; <bibl>Lucan ii. 197</bibl>; Auson. Grat. act. iii. 13; Serv. <bibl>Ecl. i. 33</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the saepta gladiatorial combats were exhibited by Augustus
(Suet. Aug. 43; Cass. <bibl>Dio lv. 8</bibl>), Caligula (Suet. Cal. 18), Claudius (Suet.
Claud. 21); and naumachiae, or sham naval battles, by Augustus (Cass.
<bibl>Dio lv. 10</bibl>) and Caligula (ib. lix. 10:<foreign xml:lang="greek">pa\v to\ xwri/on e)kai=no e)coru/cas kai\ u(/datos plhrw/sas i(/na mi/an nou=n e)sga/gn|</foreign>).	Nero used the building for
gymnastic exhibitions (Suet. Nero 12). In <date value="-17">17 B.C.</date> the senate was convened  here (acta lud. saec., <bibl>CIL vi. 32323</bibl>, 50), the only recorded
occasion, and Tiberius addressed the people from a tribunal erected
in it, after his return from the Illyrian campaign (Suet. Tib. 17;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lvi. 1</bibl>). Pliny speaks of the works of art that it contained
(<bibl>NH xxxvi. 29</bibl>), and Seneca of the crowds that frequented it (de ira
ii. 8. 1).</p>
<p>It was injured by the great fire of <date value="80">80 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 24</bibl>), but must
have been restored at once, for it was a favourite resort in the time of
Domitian for loungers, and a bazaar (Stat. <bibl>Silv. iv. 5</bibl>. 2; <bibl>Mart. ii. 14</bibl>. 5,
57. 2; <bibl>ix. 59</bibl>. 1; <bibl>x. 80</bibl>. 4). Another restoration was carried out by
Hadrian (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19), and the building is mentioned in the
<dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange> (id. Alex. 26), and on the post-Constantinian bronze collar of
a slave (<bibl>CIL xv. 7195</bibl>). No reference has been found to it in the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>It is certain that Augustus built the new saepta primarily to take the
place of the old as a voting precinct (cf. Cass. <bibl>Dio liii. 23</bibl>, quoted above),
but that the diminishing importance of the comitia made its use for other
purposes easy and natural, a process that was completed after Tiberius
transferred the elections from the people to the senate. Such changes
in use were probably reflected in some changes at least in the inner
arrangement of the Augustan building.</p>
<p>The saepta in its final form is represented partly on fragments of the
Marble Plan (FUR 35-36), and some of its ruins have been discovered at
seven different points, under the Palazzi Simonetti, Doria, Bonaparte,
Venezia, and the churches of San Marco and S. Maria in Via Lata (for
the literature of six of these discoveries, see HJ 560, n. 7; <bibl>BC 1893,
<pb n="461"/>
125-128</bibl>; Cavazzi, Diaconia di S. Maria in Via Lata <bibl>(1908)</bibl>, 197 sqq.;
<bibl>SR ii. 64</bibl>, 151 ; and for the last, under the Palazzetto Venezia, <bibl>NS 1911,
36</bibl>). The building was a rectangular porticus, extending along the
west side of the Via Lata (Corso), from the aqua Virgo (Frontinus, de aquis
i. 22), the present Via del Caravita, to the Via di S. Marco, a distance of
more than 400 metres (1400-1500 Roman feet). It was built of travertine,
with eight longitudinal rows of piers, and 60 metres (that is, 200 Roman
feet) deep. The first row, along the Via Lata, was ornamented with
a balustrade. Four of the inner piers under the Palazzo Doria, belonging
to the fourth and fifth rows, were measured by Hilsen. They are
1.70 metres square, 4 metres apart in the north-south direction and 6.20
in the other. Other piers further west show different dimensions (<bibl>NS
1877, 208</bibl>).  Cf. also RA  93-96.  Remains were also found when the
Palazzo Simonetti (north of S. Maria in Via Lata) was converted into the
Banco di Roma, consisting of Hadrianie brick  pilasters (obviously
therefore his restoration) about which no information has been published.</p>
<p>Lanciani has maintained that the saepta did not extend quite so far
south, and that its southern limit was marked by an ancient street which
is said to have been found in 1875 running from the Corso to the main
door of the Palazzo Venezia (LR 474; LF 21; HJ 560, n. 7), perhaps
the same as that reported to have been found in 1455 (<bibl>LS i. 58</bibl>). The
evidence for the antiquity of this street is not conclusive, and is offset
by the discovery of the masonry under the Palazzetto Venezia.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See also supra, 152, n. i.
</note></p>
<p>Whether this porticus, which constituted the saepta in the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third
century</dateRange> after the restorations or rebuildings of Domitian and Hadrian,
represents in any considerable degree the saepta of Agrippa, is an open
question. Some evidence for the affirmative is found in the existing
masonry, which is characteristic of the Augustan rather than of the later
periods, and the length of the building affords just room for eighty or
eighty-two lateral sections of the dimensions illustrated by the piers
described above, a fact that suggests a comparison with the number of
centuries voting in the comitia centuriata. If this does represent in the
main the saepta of Augustus, we must suppose that gladiatorial combats,
and still more certainly naval battles, took place in an open area on the
west side of the porticus and were witnessed from its roof or upper
story, as well as from platforms erected in the arcades. Gradually,
however, this open area was covered with new buildings, like the Iseum
and porticus Divorum (HJ 558-562 ; <bibl>BC 1893, 119-42</bibl> ; Richter 230-232;
RE i. A. 1724-1727).</p>
<p>According to a view which has been set forth with some plausibility
(<bibl>BC 1893, 136-142</bibl>), the <ref target="diribitorium" n="U">DIRIBITORIUM</ref> (q.v.), or hall where the votes
were counted, was not a separate structure, but the upper story of the
saepta. This theory accounts for the massive character of the masonry
that has been found, and for other difficulties (HJ cit.).</p>

<bibl>BC 1889, 340</bibl>; HF 967; Cons. 206). Later this Fabius was confused
with his descendant Q. Fabius Pictor, the annalist (Hier. Ep. 60. 12

(see A. Reinach, <bibl>SR ii. 1914</bibl>, 233-256; <bibl>AJA 1915, 480</bibl>), but the evidence
against it is not yet convincing.</p>

Hercules (Dionys. vi.

cf. <bibl>Solin. i. 12</bibl>). The site of the altar is described in exactly the same
words as that of the later temple (see below), and as it was standing
when Dionysius wrote, it must have been very close to the temple, and
have been preserved until the great changes of the early empire in this
part of the forum caused its removal. It is not possible to decide on which
side of the temple it was (for the literature see <ref target="saturnus-aedes" n="U">AEDES SATURNI</ref>).</p>

<p>the temple erected close to the original ara at
the foot of the Capitoline and edge of the forum (<bibl>Varro v. 42</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">in faucibus

Capitolinum</foreign>; <bibl>Dionys. i. 34</bibl>.4; vi. I. 4). It was the oldest temple of which
the erection was recorded in the pontifical archives, but there was marked
disagreement as to the exact date. One tradition ascribed its dedication
to Tullus Hostilius; according to another it was begun by the last
Tarquin (Varro ap. <bibl>Macrob. i. 8</bibl>. I; Dionys. vi. i. 4). Elsewhere,
however, its actual dedication is assigned to the magistrates of the first
years of the republic, either to Titus Larcius in his dictatorship in 50o
(Macrob. loc. cit.), who also is said to have commenced building the temple
in his second consulship in 498 (Dionys. vi. I. 4); or to Aulus Sempronius
and M. Mamercus, the consuls of 497 (<bibl>Liv. ii. 21</bibl>.   ; Dionys. loc. cit);
or to Postumus Cominius, consul in 501 and 493, by vote of the senate
(Dionys. loc. cit.). A different tradition seems to be preserved by
Gellius (ap. <bibl>Macrob. i. 8</bibl>. I:<foreign xml:lang="la"> nec me fugit Gellium scribere senatum
decresse ut aedes Saturni fieret eique rei L. Furium tribunum militum
praefuisse</foreign>). Which Furius is referred to is not known (<bibl>RE vii. 316</bibl>,
354-356; Peter, Hist. Rom. Reliq. is. 155), and this form of the tradition
is probably valueless.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> It is, however, preferred by Beloch, Rem. Gesch. 12, 13.
</note> The dedication of the temple may safely be
assigned to the beginning of the republic.</p>
<p>In <date value="-174">174 B.C.</date> a porticus was built along the clivus Capitolinus from
<pb n="464"/>
the temple to the Capitolium (<bibl>Liv. xli. 27</bibl>. 7). In <date value="-42">42 B.C.</date> the temple was
rebuilt by L. Munatius Plancus (Suet. Aug. 29; <bibl>CIL vi. 1316</bibl>; <bibl>x. 6087</bibl>).
It is mentioned incidentally in <date value="16">16 A.D</date>. (Tac. <bibl>Ann. ii. 41</bibl>), and at some
time in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> it was injured by fire and restored by vote
of the senate, as recorded in the inscription on the architrave (<bibl>CIL vi. 937</bibl>).
It is represented on three fragments of the Marble Plan (22, 23, 30), and
is mentioned in Reg. (Not. Reg. VIII).</p>
<p>Throughout the republic this temple contained the state treasury,
the aerarium  populi Romani or Saturni, in charge of the quaestors
(Fest. 2; <bibl>Solin. i. 12</bibl>; <bibl>Macrob. i. 8</bibl>. 3; Plut. Tib. Gracchus 10; App. <bibl>BC
i. 31</bibl>; <bibl>RE i. 667</bibl>, 671), and in it was a pair of scales to signify this function
(Varro, <bibl>LL v. 183</bibl>). Under the empire the same arrangement continued,
but the aerarium Saturni now contained only that part of the public
funds that was under the direction of the senate as distinguished from
the fiscus of the emperors, and was administered by praefecti generally
instead of quaestors (Plin. <bibl>Ep. x. 3</bibl>. 1; for the inscriptions relating to
the aerarium, see <bibl>DE i. 300</bibl>; and for occurrences of aerarium populi
romani or Saturni, Thes. ling. <bibl>Lat. i. 1055-1058</bibl>). It is probable that
only the money itself was kept in the temple, and that the offices of
the treasury adjoined it, perhaps at the rear in the <ref target="area-saturni" n="U">AREA SATURNI</ref> (q.v.),
until the building of the Tabularium in <date value="-78">78 B.C.</date>, when some at least of
the records were probably transferred thither. Other public documents
were affixed to the outer walls of the temple and adjacent columns
(Cass. <bibl>Dio xlv. 17</bibl>. 3; CIL ia. 587, col. 2, 1. 40; Varro, <bibl>LL v. 42</bibl>).</p>
<p>On the gable of the temple were statues of Tritons with horses (<bibl>Macrob.
i. 8</bibl>. 4), and in the cella was a statue of Saturn, filled with oil and bound
in wool (Plin. <bibl>NH xv. 32</bibl>; <bibl>Macrob. i. 8</bibl>. 5; <bibl>Rosch. iv. 431</bibl>), which was
carried in triumphal processions (<bibl>Dionys. vii. 72</bibl>. 13). The day of dedication was the Saturnalia, 17th December (Fast. Amit. ad xvi Kal. Ian., CIL
is. p. 245, 337; Liv. xxii. I. 19). There are a few blocks of the podium
of the original temple still remaining, and a drain below and in front
is probably as early, in which case it and some similar drains close by
are the earliest examples of the stone arch in Italy (TF 51-54 attributes
the drain to the <dateRange from="-399" to="-300">fourth century B.C.</dateRange>, but his suggestion as to its object
is unacceptable). There is no trace of any construction of an intermediate
period, and the existing podium belongs to the temple of Plancus. It is
constructed of walls of travertine and peperino, with concrete filling,
and was covered with marble facing. It is 22.50 metres wide, about
40 long, and its front and east side rise very high above the forum because
of the slope of the Capitoline hill. The temple was Ionic, hexastyle
prostyle, with two columns on each side, not counting those at the
angles. Of the superstructure eight columns of the pronaos remain,
six in front and one on each side, together with the entablature, hitherto
attributed to the period of the final restoration. It seems more likely
that Fiechter (<bibl>Toeb. i. 5</bibl> sqq.) is right in attributing the cornice to the
<pb n="465"/>
Augustan period, on the analogy of several other cornices (T. Divi Iuli,
Magnae Matris, Regia, etc.). The architrave blocks with the palmette
frieze belowthem belong to the forum of Trajan,whence theywere removed
for the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> restoration (ibid. 62-66). The front columns are
of grey and those on the sides of red granite, while the entablature is
of white marble. The columns are 11 metres in height and 1.43 in diameter at the base; but in some of them the drums that form the shaft
have been wrongly placed, so that the shaft does not taper regularly
toward the top. The bases also are of three different kinds-Attic,
and Corinthian with and without a plinth.</p>
<p>The steps of this temple were of peculiar form, on account of the closeness
of the clivus Capitolinus and the sharp angle which it made in front of
the temple, the main flight being only about one-third the width of the
pronaos.  (For the latest excavations round the temple, see <bibl>NS 1899, 49</bibl>;
<bibl>AA 1899, 7</bibl>; <bibl>CR 1899, 234</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1902, 26</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1902, 9</bibl>; for the later
tradition of the site, <bibl>BC 1914, 87-88</bibl>, 102; for the temple in general,

foundations of a gate of the imperial period are in situ, together with
a small piece of road pavement; a little lower down they turned at
right angles and ran to the south-west corner of the hill; but here they
have been built over by a house of the imperial period, and survive only

of these passages give any topographical information (Val. <bibl>Max. vi. 9</bibl>. 13;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lviii. 5</bibl>), but that does not determine the course of these steps
with precision. It is probable, however, that it coincided approximately
with the present Via di S. Pietro in carcere (HF iv.; <bibl>Gilb. i. 327</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 164</bibl>;

shortly afterwards destroyed. During the excavations of 1900-1902
there were found on the site of this earlier discovery, in front of the
row of chambers that support the clivus Capitolinus, the remains of a
room of trapezoidal shape, with a pavement of white marble. A marble
seat encircled three sides of the chamber and in the middle of the north
wall is a door from which a flight of steps led up to the level of the clivus
Capitolinus. There were also marks of posts or columns on the pavement.

(Tert. ad nat. ii. g; Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 217-218</bibl>; <bibl>Prop. iv. 9</bibl>. 74), but the

<p>Besides aedes (Grk. <foreign xml:lang="greek">i(ero\n</foreign>), the temple was called templum (Pliny),
fanum (Tert.) and sacellum (Livy). Although small aedes were sometimes
called sacella, the use of this term by Livy may perhaps be explained on
the hypothesis that the shrine of this deity was open to the sky (cf. <bibl>Varro

only an open area in the first place and afterwards a hall. The site of
the senaculum referred to in the passages cited is further determined
by later writers as close to the Volcanal, at the edge of the Comitium
and in front of the basilica Opimia and area Concordiae (<bibl>Macrob. i. 8</bibl>. 2:<foreign xml:lang="la">habet (i.e. templum Saturni) aram et ante senaculum</foreign>; Fest. 347:<foreign xml:lang="la"> unum

<p>In the passage from Festus just quoted, it is stated, on the authority
of a certain Nicostratus of the <dateRange from="100" to="199">second century</dateRange>, that there were two
other senacula in Rome where the senate was wont to assemble, one ad
portam Capenam, the other citra aedem Bellonae. Of these senacula
there is no further mention, but the senate met during the year after the
battle of Cannae ad portam Capenam (<bibl>Liv. xxiii. 32</bibl>), and many such
meetings took place in the temple of Bellona whenever foreign ambassadors, generals desiring a triumph, or any person who could not
lawfully be admitted within the pomerium, were to appear before the
senate (see <ref target="bellona-aedes" n="U">BELLONA, AEDES</ref>). It is not certain whether this statement
of Nicostratus is based on a confusion of senaculum and the regular hall
of assembly, or on the fact that such buildings had been erected at these
points (HJ 204, 553; Mommsen, <bibl>Staatsrecht iii. 913-914</bibl>; Becker, Top.
286, 516-517, 607; <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 337; BC1908, 138-139).</p>

clivum Capitolinum silice sternendum curaverunt et porticum ab aede
Saturni in Capitolium ad senaculum ac super id curiam</foreign>). If the text is
not corrupt here-as it is in the lines immediately preceding-there must
have been a senaculum on the Capitoline bearing the same relation to
the curia Calabra and the temple of Jupiter that the senaculum below
did to the curia Hostilia. In view of Nicostratus' statement, and the
apparent needlessness of another senaculum  immediately above the

<p>Septimontium was also the name of a festival, celebrated on 11th

Palatine and Esquiline, which is mentioned in the calendars and several
times in literature, especially in the following passages:-Varro, <bibl>LL vi.
24</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">dies Septimontium nominatus ab his septem montibus in quis sita
urbs est feriae non populi sed montanorum modo ut Paganalia qui sunt

must obviously be omitted, and the choice has

<p>It is quite evident that some  Roman antiquarians believed that the festival of the was based on the inclusion
within the limits of the city of seven hills or
parts of hills, but that they differed as to which hills these were (cf. also Serv. <bibl>Aen. vi.
783</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">alii dicunt breves septem  colliculos a Romulo inclusos qui tamen aliis nominibus appellabantur; alii volunt hos ipsos qui nunc
sunt a Romulo inclusos, id est Palatinum Quirinalem Aventinum Caelium
Viminalem Esquilinum Ianicularem: alii vero volunt hos quidem fuisse
aliis tamen nominibus appellatos</foreign>). The question therefore is whether an
early stage in the city's growth, preceding that commonly known as the
City of the Four Regions, was actually called Septimontium or whether
this is simply an invention of later antiquarians to explain the name of
the festival. While it is altogether probable, from other considerations,
that the districts named by Labeo, for instance, did at some time before the
Servian period make up the territory included within the city limits (text
fig. 6), and very certain that the Septimontium was an ancient festival,
it is not probable that this was ever an actual name of Rome. Hilsen
(<bibl>RAP ii. 83-86</bibl>) points out that three of the seven montes bear names
(Cispius, Caelius, Oppius) which are identical with those of well-known
plebeian gentes; while tradition records eponymous heroes of each hill
(Opiter Oppius, Laevius Cispius, Caelius Vibenna); further, the gentilicia
of the kings of Rome (except Romulus and the Etruscan Tarquins) are
<pb n="473"/>
all plebeian. On the other hand, the names of the sixteen tribus rusticae
are all patrician. It therefore seems as if the families that expelled the
Tarquins formed an oligarchy, the patricians, while the other older
families, who had been their partisans, lost many of their privileges and
became plebeian. The whole subject of the Septimontium  is complicated and quite obscure (for a full discussion of the whole matter, see
Wissowa, Septimontium  und Subura, Satura Viadrina, <bibl>Breslau 1896,

faSade at this corner of the hill, visible to all who approached by the via
Appia, and also as an entrance to the imperial precinct. The latter
purpose could not be carried out because the prefect of the city set up
the statue of the emperor in the central niche. Ammianus (loc. cit.)
implies that the building was in fact a nymphaeum of imposing size and
appearance; and a septizonium  at Lambaesis had an 'aqueductus et
nymphaei opus' attached to it (<bibl>CIL viii. 2657</bibl>).
<pb n="474"/></p>
<p>The whole of the latter part of the passage in Hist. Aug. Sev. 24:<foreign xml:lang="la">nisi absente eo per praefectum  urbis medium  simulacrum  cius esset
locatum, aditum Palatinis aedibus, id est regium atrium, ab ea parte
facere voluisse perhibetur</foreign>, has recently been taken by v. Domaszewski
(<bibl>SHA  1916, 7</bibl>. A, 5-7; <bibl>1918, 13</bibl>. A, 48), like that in id. Get. 7 (cf.
<ref target="sep-severi" n="U">SEPULCRUM SEVERI</ref>) to be an interpolation; and this is why Hulsen in
his latest restoration (published by Rushforth in the Legacy of Rome,
fig. 35, opp. p. 399) has omitted the statue of Severus which had previously
been inserted in the central niche. The very existence of a main approach
to the Palatine on this side at this period seems highly doubtful.</p>
<p>Dombart, however, retains it in his restoration, and inclines to refer
to it the second colossus named in Not. Brev. He differs from Hulsen
mainly (a) in placing the columns in the niches closer to their back walls,
(b) in giving half domes to the niches.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> As Hulsen points out, a great part of the inscription would, if it had run round niches
of this kind, have been illegible; and he therefore prefers to make them rectangular, putting
small curved niches at the angles.
</note> The design of the front (an
ornamental facade with three large niches, and three orders of columns)
owed much to the type of permanent stage decoration (scaenae frons)
which is seen in the back walls of the stages of various provincial theatres
of the Roman period; and it is not without parallels, of which the
nymphaea (expressly so called in inscriptions) of Miletus and Side are
the most striking.  There appears indeed to be no doubt that it was
actually decorated with fountains; and it also seems clear that the
interior, which would have served no useful purpose, was not originally
accessible except by means of ladders. There is no evidence for an
external staircase at the back. Dombart (p. 96) has misquoted Demontosius, Gallus Romae Hospes, 25.</p>
<p>A very difficult problem is presented by the name and its meaning.
The form  septizodium  is first found in the Pseudo-Dositheus (about
<date value="207">207 A.D.</date>) and in an inscription, CIL viii. (Suppl.) 14372 (about <date value="210">210 A.D.</date>),
but is probably to be treated as incorrect and may therefore be disregarded
(Schtirer, Zeitschr. f. d. neutestamentliche Wissenschaft vi. <bibl>(1905)</bibl>,
29ff., 63 ff.). Unsuccessful attempts have been made to  interpret
septizonium in a literal sense, and to see in it a building which is capable
of division, whether horizontally or vertically, into seven sections or belts.
There is no doubt, however, that the building only had three stories.
The reference to the seven planets (Maass, Tagesgbtter 106-117) may,
however, be accepted even so, if the meaning of [<foreign xml:lang="greek">zw/nh</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="greek">e(pta/zwnos</foreign> be
kept in mind (Dombart in RE ii. A. 1582, who is inclined to suppose
that the building was actually decorated with emblems representing the
seven planetary divinities of the seven days of the week, and who also
emphasises the importance of the number seven in connection with the
Ziggurats of Babylonia; cf. his article in Jahrb. d. Inst. xxxiv. <bibl>(1919)</bibl>,
40-64).

<p>The mediaeval corruptions of the name are many- septem viae,<note anchored="true" place="foot">i.e.<foreign xml:lang="greek">e(pta\ o(doi/</foreign>, which shows that in Rome the common form in late times was not
Septizonium, but Septodium.</note>
septem solia (divided into maius and minus, referring to the east and
west ends), while the name scuola di Vergilio came from the fact that
mediaeval scholars found in the septodium the trivium et quadrivium
liberalium  artium. The church of S. Lucia de Septem  solio is first
mentioned in Eins. (11.5; 13.28; HCh 305); another church, S. Leone
de Septem Soliis stood opposite to it, on the slopes of the Caelian
(HCh 297-298). The mediaeval history of the building, which served as
a fortress, is interesting (Stevenson, <bibl>BC 1888, 292-298</bibl>; Bartoli, <bibl>BA
1909, 253-269</bibl>; <bibl>LS iv. 137-139</bibl>).  Its destruction was completed by
14th September, 1588 (<bibl>ASRSP 1910, 305</bibl>).</p>
<p>The east angle of the building itself was preserved until the pontificate
of Sixtus V who ordered its destruction, and the use of its materials for
his own buildings. We learn from the records of its demolition that
many columns, etc., of rare marbles had been employed in its construction, which probably came from various different sources. The columns
of the three orders were all composite. We are therefore thrown back
on the Forma Urbis (fr. 34) and the numerous Renaissance representations
of the building for information about it; and hence there has been
much discussion about its details, though its general form may be taken
as certain (cf. the restorations of Dombart and Hulsen cited).</p>
<p>An interesting confirmation of Hulsen's reconstruction (here he is
followed by Dombart) at the posterior angles (a wall instead of a fourth
column) is given by a picture by Macrino d'Alba <bibl>(dated 1496)</bibl>. See

<p> the modern name given to the archaic necropolis found in

of Villanovan stock, and in date range from the twelfth or eleventh to
the <dateRange from="-899" to="-800">ninth century B.C.</dateRange>; that the inhumation burials are to be divided

<dateRange from="-699" to="-600">seventh century B.C.</dateRange>, the last tomb being G in Boni's list, which contained
an imported Greek lekythos with figures of running dogs. As to the
Esquiline cemeteries, which range from the ninth to the sixth centuries
B.C., and have yielded practically nothing but inhumation graves, he
treats it as still an open question whether the population is to be identified
as Picene or as Etruscan; while in regard to the Villanovans, he does not
accept the theory of Pigorini, Colini and others, who hold the Villanovans
to be direct descendants of the inhabitants of the ' terremare; and
prefers to derive both from the Central European and Danubian stocks
as distinct and parallel nations. Von Duhn, on the other hand (Italische
Graberkunde 415 sqq.), regards the cremation tombs of the forum as
a good deal earlier than the inhumation tombs, while later than and not
contemporary with the earliest tombs of the Alban hills; and Hulsen
(<bibl>Mitt. 1905, 95-115</bibl>; HC 210-217) dates them from the ninth or eighth

This facing takes the form of horizontal and vertical cylinders in rows,

<pb n="483"/>
that Romulus was buried in or pro rostris or post rostra; and in the
former version two lions are mentioned as having stood by the tomb.
Dion. <bibl>Hal. i. 87</bibl> says that, according to one story, the lion (he mentions
only one) which lay by the rostra stood over the body of Faustulus;
while in iii. I he says that the father of Tullus Hostilius was buried here,
with a stele to celebrate his virtues.</p>
<p>The discovery in 1899 opposite the front of the curia Iulia, and orientated with it, of a pavement of black marble slabs-they are marmor
Taenarium-about 4 metres long by 3 wide, lying on the same level as
the Caesarian pavement of the comitium, was naturally brought into
connection with the niger lapis; and investigations were undertaken
beneath it. A group of very ancient monuments was found, the chronological sequence of which is as follows: (I) an archaic inscribed four-sided
cippus, the upper part of which has been broken off. It stands in a
shallow hollow, cut for it in the surface of a pavement, but has been
slightly displaced. It has given rise to much discussion; and the state
of our knowledge with regard to the content of the text is summarised
by Lommatzsch in CIL i². I. 'It seems,' he says, 'that it is a law
or laws as to certain rites to be performed by the king or perhaps by those
in attendance on the king in the comitium. To attempt to define it
further would be useless, as we do not even know how much of the
cippus is lost.' As to the date, he fixes it about <date value="-500">500 B.C.</date>, as being slightly
later than the fibula of Praeneste (ib. 3). Cf. also <bibl>AJP 1907, 249-272</bibl>,
373-400. The freshness of the surface may be explained by the fact that
it was covered with stucco.</p>
<p>(2) a conical column of tufa dating from the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange>.</p>
<p>(3) the so-called sacellum-consisting of (a) a rectangular foundation
of one course of tufa blocks, on which rest two bases, each 2.66 metres
long and I.31 broad; these support pedestals of tufa with curved profiles,
probably to be reconstructed similarly to the altar of VERMINUS (q.v.).
These pedestals might very well have supported the statues of recumbent
lions. Between them is a block of stone, on which the original niger lapis
may have stood.  (b) another small platform  of tufa blocks directly
behind, with no trace of any superstructure. For the orientation of
the sacellum, see <ref target="rostra" n="U">ROSTRA</ref>. It dates probably from the <dateRange from="-350" to="-300">latter half of the
fourth century B.C.</dateRange></p>
<p>Between this group of monuments and the black marble pavement
there lay (a) a stratum of river sand and gravel 0.55 metre thick, (b) a
layer, 0.40 metre thick, of earth and ashes, in which various objects of
pottery, terra cotta and bronze were found (including even fragments
of the black marble pavement), dating, not (as was at first announced),
from the <dateRange from="-599" to="-500">sixth century B.C.</dateRange>, but from the <dateRange from="-599" to="-1">sixth to the first century B.C.</dateRange>,
and mixed together in the utmost confusion. A full report upon them
has not yet been published; but if there really was no stratification,
they cannot have formed a stips votiva.
<pb n="484"/></p>
<p>The original idea, that the destruction of these monuments dates
from the fire of the Gauls, is therefore untenable; and it is doubtful
whether the black marble pavement was laid by Sulla (so Van Deman
in <bibl>JRS 1922, 24</bibl>), by Caesar <note anchored="true" place="foot"> An argument adduced in favour of this view is the fact that it lies precisely in line
with the door of the Curia.
</note> (in which case it is doubtful whether niger
lapis would be a correct term for it, and the absence of any mention
in the literature of the empire of so striking a monument is as strange
as the fact that it does not correspond at all, in extent or orientation,
with the monuments beneath), or by Maxentius, who is known to have
revived the cult of Romulus, and indeed set up close by a base with the
inscription ' Marti invicto patri et aeternae urbis suae conditoribus.' The
rough edging of white marble blocks (and, perhaps, the diminution of the
size of the black marble pavement) would date from an even later period.</p>

<p> * the family tomb of the Cornelii Scipiones near the via
Appia, about 400 metres south-east of the point where the via Latina
branched off to the east, and at the intersection of a cross road that
connected the two great viae. The importance of the family made
this one of the most notable monuments of the kind in Rome (cf. Cic.
<bibl>Tusc. i. 13</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> an tu egressus porta Capena, cum  Calatini Scipionum
Serviliorum Metellorum sepulcra vides, miseros illos putes ?</foreign>). Ennius
was buried in this tomb, and his marble statue erected by Africanus
(Cic. pro Arch. 22; Plin. NH vii. I 14; Suet. de poet. 8; <bibl>Liv. xxxviii. 56</bibl>).
<pb n="485"/>
The statues of Publius and Lucius Scipio are also said to have been
placed in the tomb (Liv. loc. cit.).</p>
<p>As the Scipios regularly followed the practice of inhumation and not
cremation (Cic. de legg. ii. 57), the tomb was filled with sarcophagi,
arranged for the most part in loculi cut in the tufa rock. (It is probable
that there was a quarry here before the tomb was made.) The tomb
was opened early in the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange>, and one sarcophagus,
that of L. Scipio, consul in <date value="-259">259 B.C.</date>, was broken and its inscribed lid
removed, but the final excavation of the monument was carried out
in 1780 (Piranesi e Visconti, Monumenti degli Scipioni, Roma 1785
=Visconti, Opere varie, Milan 1827, i. 1-70; Nibby, Roma Antica, ii.
561-575). Many of the sarcophagi were then broken and their contents
scattered (CIL i². pp. 373-375), though Hilsen, to whom the description
of the tomb in CIL cit. is due, considers that much of the damage had
already been done in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>; but one, that of L. Scipio
Barbatus, consul in <date value="-298">298 B.C.</date>, and apparently the first to be buried there,
was preserved and is now in the Vatican, together with portions of
several others and their original inscriptions. These inscriptions (CIL
12. 6-16=vi. 1284-1294) record the burial of eight members of the
family, from Barbatus (vid. sup.) to Paulla Cornelia, wife of a certain
Hispallus of unknown date but probably later than <date value="-150">150 B.C.</date> (<bibl>RE iv. 1600</bibl>,
No. 445). Some of them  are written in the Saturnian metre and are
extremely valuable for the history of Latin literature and phonology,
but they are probably later than the date usually assigned to them. That
of Barbatus, for instance, is probably not earlier than the second Punic
war (Bticheler, Carm. Lat. Epig. i. Nos. 6-9; W6lfflin, Bayr. Sitz.-Ber.
1892, i. 188-219). Of the sarcophagi, that of Barbatus alone was decorated
with a Doric entablature with Ionic volutes. The others were perfectly
plain. See LR 323-329; HJ 200, 211 and reff.</p>
<p>The tomb has quite recently been completely cleared, and restored
as far as possible to its original condition, facsimiles of the sarcophagus of
Barbatus and of the inscriptions having been put in their proper places.
Its facade lay on the cross-road already mentioned, and consisted
of the natural rock, which had been hewn vertically and coated with
plaster for a length of some 25 m. The paintings with which this facade
was decorated are fragmentary.  In it are two openings-the main
entrance, the ancient form of which has completely disappeared, and
what has generally been believed to be an arched doorway, but is far more
likely to be a window. Within the rock are passages, originally quite
regular, but much altered in the third and fourth centuries A.D. (when
a house was built over the tomb, and the rock consequently needed reinforcement) as well as in modern days <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Nibby, cit. 562, wrongly attributes the supporting walls entirely to modern reconstruction.

<p> a building of unknown origin, situated at the extreme south-

outside the porta Esquilina or on the Esquiline in qua est Sessorium,
although this building was at least 1400 metres from the gate. That
part of the building which was outside the Aurelian wall was destroyed,
but the extensive inner section became an imperial residence by the
<date value="400">beginning of the fourth century</date>, and Helena, the mother of Constantine,
lived here. Hence it was called palatium Sessorianum (LP. vit. Silves. 22;
<bibl>LPD i. 179</bibl>, 196, n. 75).</p>
<p>Constantine converted one of the halls of the palace <note anchored="true" place="foot"> P. Whitehead's theory is that the original basilica is the hall behind at a lower
level and that the present church was only placed in the larger hall in the Middle
Ages.
</note>into the church
of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, and placed in it the fragments of the true
cross which Helena brought from Jerusalem. This hall was 34.35 metres
long, 21.75 wide and 20 high, with five open arches on each side and
windows above, and resembled closely the so-called templum  Sacrae
Urbis of Vespasian both in construction and scheme of decoration.
Constantine walled up the arches and added the apse at the east end,
but the columns were not set up until the <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange>. North of the
church are the remains of another hall of the Sessorium, consisting of
the apse with external buttresses, added almost immediately after its
construction, and the start of the nave, probably belonging to the time
of Maxentius (Ill. 49). This hall was intact down to the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>
and was erroneously called templum Veneris et Cupidinis (RA 147-152).

Maffei relief (Cod. Vat. 3439, f. 58),<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1890, 152</bibl>.</note> and on coins of Philippus Arabus
(Cohen, v. 138, Nos. 12-13), where the marking has usually been thought
to indicate that of Murcia. The templum Solis et Lunae of the Notitia
(Reg. XI) is undoubtedly this temple, and it is so called in the calendars,
where the day of dedication is given as 28th August (Fast. Praen. Philoc.
ad v Kal. Sept., CIL i². p. 239, 270, 315; HJ 115; WR 315; <bibl>Rosch. iv.

by Tacitus as apud (near) the circus is to be identified with the so-called
temple of Portunus, see ZA 248-250.</p>
<p>The original church of S. Maria del Sole lay, however, near Tor de'
Specchi (Panciroli, Tesori Nascosti (ed. 2), 78, copied by Bruti ap. Arm.

was transferred to S. Stefano delle Carrozze.</p>

<p>* a temple built by Aurelian
after his return from the east in 273, and famous for its magnificence
(Hist. Aug. Aur. I.3;25.6; 39.2; Aur. Vict. Caes. 35.7; <bibl>Zos. i. 61</bibl>). Among
its treasures were many jewels and much gold (Hist. Aug. Aur. 39. 6;
<bibl>Eutrop. ix. 15</bibl>), a silver statue of Aurelian (Hist. Aug. Tac. 9. 2), jewelled
robes (id. Aur. 28. 5), and a painting of Aurelian and Ulpius Crinitus
(id. Aur. IO. 2; cf. Firm. 3. 4). The Sol worshipped in this temple was
probably a synthesis of several oriental Ba'alim (<bibl>Rosch. iv. 1147-148</bibl>;
cf. Watzinger and Wulzinger, Damaskus 38 (and Addenda 8*). In
connection with the temple was a porticus (Hist. Aug. Aur. 35. 3), in
which were stored the vina fiscalia (ib. 48. 4: in porticibus templi Solis
vina fiscalia ponuntur) that had been brought from the <ref target="ciconiae-nixae" n="U">CICONIAE NIXAE</ref>
(q.v.), cf. CILvi. 1785 =31931; cf. <ref target="porticus-gordiani" n="U">PORTICUS GORDIANI</ref>). The last reference
to it in antiquity is in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> (Anon. de Antiq. <bibl>CpI. iv. 66</bibl>, ed.
Banduri) when eight of the porphyry columns were sent to Constantinople
for the church of S. Sophia (see in general HJ 453-456; <bibl>Rosch. iv. 1146-1149</bibl>; Richter 263-265).</p>
<p>This temple was in <rs key="regio7" type="region">Region VII</rs> (Not.), and in campo Agrippae (Chron.
148:<foreign xml:lang="la"> templum  Solis et castra<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The <ref target="castra-urbana" n="U">CASTRA URBANA</ref> (q.v.); cf. <ref target="castra-urbana" n="U">FORUM SUARIUM</ref>.

exact site has occasioned much discussion.  In the gardens of the
Palazzo Colonna considerable remains of a great temple were standing
in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>, consisting principally of part of the cella wall
of peperino and the north (right) corner of the facade and pediment.
This was known as the Torre Mesa, Torre di Mecenate, and Frontispizio
di Nerone; LR, fig. 166 from Duperac, Vestigi, pl. 31 <bibl>(1575)</bibl>.  Part of
<pb n="492"/>
these ruins were removed at the <date value="1499">end of the fifteenth century</date>, and more
between 1549 and 1555, but the final destruction of the Torre itself was
not effected until about 1630 (<bibl>LS iii. 203-205</bibl>, and earlier references there
given). Numerous drawings and plans of these ruins are extant, made
by the architects and artists of the period, from Sangallo <note anchored="true" place="foot"> His plan is the only one that is trustworthy.
</note> (Barb. 63v', 65,
65v, 68v) in the <dateRange from="1400" to="1499">fifteenth century</dateRange> to Giovannoli (III. 47) and Donati in
the early seventeenth (for list see HJ 422, n. 79; LS loc. cit.; DuP 141) <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Add Meded. Nederl. Hist. <bibl>Inst. vii. 1927</bibl>, 89-92.
</note>;
the plans, however, by their differences in detail show that they have been
arbitrarily filled in. The building stood on the edge of the hill, on the
west side of the present Via della Consulta, and extended due east and
west, with a great flight of steps leading from the platform at the rear
of the cella to the plain some 20 metres below. This flight was curiously
built, being divided into double narrow rows of steps on each side of a
central space. The temple area was surrounded with a wall containing
niches but not with the usual porticus. The cella was built of peperino
lined with marble, and was surrounded by marble columns in front and
on the sides. The shafts of these columns were 17.66, the capitals
2.47, and the entablature 4.83 metres in height. The corner of the
pediment now lying in the Colonna gardens is the largest architectural
fragment in Rome, its dimensions being 3.70 by 2.80 by 3.90 metres,
and its weight 100 tons. This temple has been identified with that of
Sol by some scholars, who would include its site in<rs key="regio7" type="region">Region VII</rs> and interpret
in campo Agrippae (v. sup.) very broadly, as for example by Lanciani
(<bibl>BC 1894, 297-307</bibl>; <bibl>1895, 94-101</bibl>) in opposition to those (<bibl>Mitt. 1888, 98</bibl>;

<p>The latter point out that the plan corresponds with that of an Egyptian
temple of the new kingdom, its essential parts being an almost square
court with a portico, a broad shallow hall on its west side, and three
rectangular cellae behind it. They note that the architectural detail is
very similar to that of the Hadrianeum.</p>
<p>If we accept this view, the temple of Sol lay north of the campus
Agrippae. Here, on the east side of the Corso between the Via S.
Claudio and the Via Frattina, have been found tufa and peperino
walls, granite columns and other architectural remains <note anchored="true" place="foot"> It has recently been asserted that they cannot be later than about <date value="230">230 A.D.</date> (Zeitschr. f.

long and 42.70 wide; the other is rectangular and 126 metres long
and 86.38 wide. These enclosures occupy the space from  the Piazza
S. Silvestro to the Via Borgognona, and are identified with the porticus
templi Solis (v. supra) (Toeb. 108- 112), while the temple itself is supposed
to have extended further north, although no traces of any sort have been
found north of the Via Frattina; cf. PI. 476, 492.</p>

<p>There is no further mention of this temple, but it is probably the
middle and largest of the three of which the ruins now exist beneath
the church of S. Nicola in Carcere and belong for the most part to the
period of the republic. It was about 30 metres long and io wide, of
the Ionic order, and amphiprostyle hexastyle. A lofty flight of steps,
twelve or thirteen in number, led up to the pronaos, and in the middle
of these steps was a long pedestal. Three of the fluted columns of
travertine, 8.70 metres in height and 6.90 in diameter, are built into
the facade, while portions of the cella wall and of other columns have
been incorporated in other parts of the church (for the description of

its name 'ad Spem veterem' to its immediate vicinity, the district just

it was said to have been erected by the state (<bibl>Liv. ii. 13</bibl>; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii.

It probably did stand in summa sacra via, near the temple of Jupiter

Livy and Plutarch agrees with this, but Seneca (de consol. 16) and Servius
state explicitly that it was standing in the first and fourth centuries.

the old statue had been restored, or a new one erected, <dateRange from="1" to="25">early in the first

was erected in the forum, and why it was brought here, we do not know.
According to a recent ingenious theory it was brought from Apamea
in <date value="-188">188 B.C.</date> by Cn. Manlius Vulso because of the legendary connection
of that city with the tomb of Aeneas, and placed near the lacus Curtius
because of a certain parallelism between the legendary self-sacrifice of
an Apamean hero and Curtius (A. Reinach, <bibl>Klio 1914, 321-337</bibl>).  The
statue was often crowned with flowers, and a certain P. Munatius was
once thrown into prison for stealing them (Plin. <bibl>NH xxi. 8-9</bibl>).</p>
<p>Marsyas came to be regarded as the symbol of liberty (Serv. ad <bibl>Aen.
iii. 20</bibl>) and under the empire his statue was set up in the fora of those
towns in the provinces that possessed the ius Italicum (Cagnat, Timgad

the Via dello Statuto. Another depression extended from the Subura
northward between the Viminal and the Quirinal, and a third north-east
between the Cispius and the Viminal that was marked by the vicus
Patricius.  The beginning of the Subura was called primae fauces

that Subura was a corrupt form of the same word, which for some reason
had been transferred, and in historical times was given to this valley
and used as an adjective in ' regio Suburana' (see SUCUSA and <ref target="regiones-quattuor" n="U">REGIONES

<bibl>Peristeph. xi. 45</bibl>), and continued in use during the Middle Ages in the
names of several churches situated between the Tor di Conti and S. Pietro
in Vincoli (Arm. 201, 203, 206, 219-223; HJ 332; HCh 166, 193, 205,
207, 420, 454, 459). Cf. also S. Agata dei Goti (by Hulsen and others),
<bibl>Rome 1924, 7-9</bibl>. S. Lucia in Orfea or in Silice is also called in capite
Suburae (HCh 306, 595).</p>
<p>References to the character of this district are frequent in Latin
literature and inscriptions.  It was fervens (<bibl>Iuv. xi. 51</bibl>, and schol.
frequentissima regio), clamosa (<bibl>Mart. xii. 18</bibl>. 2), dirty and wet (ib. v. 22.

78. ii ; Priap. 40. I), of dealers in provisions and delicacies (<bibl>Iuv. xi. 141</bibl>;
<bibl>Mart. vii. 31</bibl>; <bibl>x. 94</bibl>. 5-6) and finery (<bibl>Mart. ix. 37</bibl>), and of tradesmen of
various sorts (praeco, <bibl>CIL vi. 1953</bibl>; crepidarius, ib. 9284; ferrarius, 9399;
lanarius, 9491; inpilarius, 33862; lintearius, 9526). That there were also
dwellings of more distinguished persons is shown by the fact that Caesar
once lived here (Suet. Caes. 46) and L. Arruntius Stella, consul in <date value="101">101 A.D.</date>
(<bibl>Mart. xii. 3</bibl>. 9; cf. xii. 21. 5). Of a probable late division into Subura
maior and Subura minor, to be inferred from the reading of one inscription
(<bibl>CIL vi. 9526</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">Sebura maiore ad ninfas</foreign>), nothing further is known. See

where Antistius Labeo is quoted as the authority for a list of montes
in the <ref target="septimontium" n="U">SEPTIMONTIUM</ref> (q.v.), eight instead of seven. This emendation
is based on the existence of a pagus Succusanus, a district which was
of course outside the limits of the city in its early stages. This pagus
is mentioned in two of our sources-Varro, <bibl>LL v. 48</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">sed [ego a] pago

Ceroniae, just inside the porta Caelimontana of the Servian  wall
(HF i.), and the pagus Succusanus still further east, the district extending north-east from the Lateran. This position of the pagus accords
with the statement of Festus but hardly with that of Varro. The whole
question of the relation of Subura, Succusa and pagus Succusanus, and
the location of the latter is very obscure and has given rise to much
discussion.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Hulsen remarks that the name Suburana, which belongs to one of the four city tribes,
is regularly abbreviated suc in inscriptions (<bibl>CIL vi. 2993</bibl> is a forgery, cf. ib. 3613*) and

<p>(templa, Ovid): </p>
<p>a temple near the circus Maximus (Fast.:

Summani), which probably replaced an altar ascribed to Titus Tatius
(Varro, <bibl>LL v. 74</bibl>). It was built during the war with Pyrrhus (Ov. <bibl>Fast.
vi. 731-732</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> reddita quisquis is est Summano templa feruntur/ tum cum

this was done because the terracotta figure of Summanus in the pediment
of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was reported to have been struck
by lightning and hurled into the Tiber (Cic. de div. i. 10; Liv. per. xiv.;
<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 14-15, 98-100). The temple of Summanus was itself struck
by lightning in <date value="-197">197 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. xxxii. 29</bibl>. I). Its day of dedication was
20th June (Ov. loc. cit.; Fast. Esquil. Venus. Amit. ad xii Kal. Iul.,
CIL i². p. 211, 221, 243, 320). There is little doubt that it stood on the

inscriptions show that this choragium was administered by imperial
freedmen and slaves, and summum has therefore been interpreted as
meaning imperial, in distinction from other choragia that belonged to
aerarium (Hirschfeld, VG2 293-6; contra Mommsen, Staatsrecht, ii. 1070,

<p> the shops that were built in the forum valley
when that became the market-place for the settlements on the surrounding
hills, assigned by tradition to the first Tarquin (<bibl>Liv. i. 35</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 67</bibl>).
They belonged to the state and were let out to tenants (Non. 532; <bibl>Liv.
xxvi. 27</bibl>; xxvii. II; <bibl>xl. 51</bibl>; Fest. 230; Dig. xviii. I. 32), who were at
first dealers in provisions, especially butchers, from whom the shops
were called tabernae lanienae. At some time before <date value="-310">310 B.C.</date> these
occupants were banished to the district north of the forum (see <ref target="macellum" n="U">MACELLUM</ref>)
and the shops turned over to money changers and bankers, argentarii
(Varro ap. Non. 532: <foreign xml:lang="la">hoc intervallo primum  forensis dignitas crevit
atque ex tabernis lanienis argentariae factae</foreign>). In <date value="-310">310 B.C.</date> an attempt
was made at decoration of the forum, and gilded shields were distributed
to the domini argentariarum (<bibl>Liv. ix. 40</bibl>. 16). Argentariae appears to
have been the designation of these tabernae until <date value="-210">210 B.C.</date> when some
at least of them were burned (<bibl>Liv. xxvi. 27</bibl>. 2: <foreign xml:lang="la">eodem tempore septem
tabernae quae postea quinque, et argentariae quae nunc novae appellantur, arsere</foreign>). In the following year the septem tabernae were rebuilt
(Liv. xxvii. I . 16), and those called novae afterwards, but for any definite
notice of this building we are dependent on a corrupt passage in Festus
(230). This, with Miller's emendations, reads:(<foreign xml:lang="la">plebeias tabernas no)vas
vocant nos(tra aetate, ut dicunt V tabern</foreign>)as<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Lindsay omits this supplement.

</note> This
emendation is probably sufficiently correct to warrant the conclusion that
the shops burned in <date value="-210">210</date> and not rebuilt in <date value="-209">209</date> were reerected before
<date value="-192">192</date> and called plebeiae or novae. The first name, however, if it ever
existed, did not come into common use, for we find no other instance
of its occurrence. These tabernae were called argentariae novae (<bibl>Liv.
xl. 51</bibl>. 5), or novae alone (<bibl>Liv. iii. 48</bibl>. 5). Once the old designation,
argentariae alone, is used (Vitr. v. I. I). In distinction from the novae,
others were called vetcres, a name that occurs first in Plautus (Curc. 480 :<foreign xml:lang="la">sub veteribus ibi sunt qui dant quique accipiunt faenore)</foreign>. Thenceforth
sub veteribus (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 25</bibl>, 113) and sub novis (Varro, <bibl>LL vi. 59</bibl>;
Cic. de or. ii. 266) were regularly used to designate the opposite sides of
the forum, as is proved by a passage in Cicero (Acad. pr. ii. 70: <foreign xml:lang="la">ut ii qui
<pb n="505"/>
sub novis solem non ferunt item ille quum aestuaret veterum ut Maenianorum</foreign>). This and other topographical indications show that the tabernae
novae were on the north side of the forum, in front of the earliest basilica
Aemilia (<bibl>Liv. iii. 48</bibl>. 5: <foreign xml:lang="la">prope Cloacinae ad tabernas quibus nunc novis
est nomen</foreign> ; <bibl>xl. 51</bibl>. 5 :<foreign xml:lang="la"> basilicam post argentarias novas</foreign>), and the veteres
on the south side between the vicus Tuscus and the temple of Saturn
(<bibl>Liv. xliv. 16</bibl>. 10: <foreign xml:lang="la">pone veteres ad Vortumni signum</foreign>). The latest
references which necessarily imply the separate existence of these tabernae
are in Livy (locc. citt.) and Verrius Flaccus (ap. Fest. 230), and they
could not have survived the building of the basilica Iulia and the restoration of the basilica Aemilia by Augustus (cf. <bibl>Quint. vi. 3</bibl>. 38). Thereafter
the argentarii had offices in these basilicas, but ' sub novis' and 'sub veteri-
bus ' continued in use as local designations of the north and south sides
of the forum, the older shops being placed on the shady side.</p>
<p>The <foreign xml:lang="la">tabernae septem quae postea quinque</foreign>, burned in 210 and rebuilt
the next year (<bibl>Liv. xxvi. 27</bibl>; xxvii. I  supra citt.) were not the tabernae
novae, and if we accept the emendation proposed for Festus 230 (see
above), Verrius cited the change from septem to quinque as -analogous
to that from plebeiae to novae. On the other hand, their identification
with the veteres has often been claimed, but without convincing evidence.
It is more probable that they were different, and lay perhaps somewhat
to the east of the veteres. They are not the quinque tabernae of Juvenal
(i. 105), as has been asserted.</p>
<p>Over these tabernae were galleries from which the people witnessed
the games in the forum, called Maeniana from C. Maenius, who is said to
have built them first after his victory in the battle of Actium (Fest. 135;
Vitr. v. I. i; Isid. <bibl>Orig. xv. 3</bibl>. II; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 113</bibl>; Cic. Acad.

<p>* a name used twice by Cicero (ad <bibl>Fam. xiv. 2</bibl>. 2: <foreign xml:lang="la">nam
ad me P. Valerius, homo officiosus, scripsit, id quod ego maximo cum
fletu legi, quem ad modum a Vestae ad tabulam Valeriam ducta esses
(Terentia); in Vat. 21: cum eum (Bibulum) tu consulem in vincula duceres
et a tabula Valeria collegae tui mitti iuberent</foreign>), where it indicates a
definite spot in the forum. Three explanations of this term have been
given:</p>
<p>(I) that it means the bank of Valerius, to which Terentia had
been forced by Clodius to go in order to make some declaration about
<pb n="506"/>
her husband's estate (Tyrrell and Purser, Correspondence of <bibl>Cicero
i. 387</bibl>). This interpretation is supported by a similar meaning, bank of
Sestius, given to tabula Sestia in Cicero, pro Quinct. 25: <foreign xml:lang="la">pueros circum
amicos dimittit, ipse suos necessarios ab atriis Liciniis et a faucibus
macelli corrogat, ut ad tabulam Sextiam sibi adsint hora secunda postridie</foreign>.</p>
<p>(2) that it was a painting by Q. Fabius Pictor on the wall of the
Curia Hostilia, which represented the victory of M. Valerius Messalla
over Hiero and the Carthaginians in <date value="-264">264 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Plin. xxxv. 22</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> dignatio

</note> proelii quo Carthaginienses et Hieronem in
Sicilia vicerat proposuit in latere curiae Hostiliae anno ab urbe condita
CCCCLXXXX</foreign>). This is the explanation of the scholiast on the passage from
the speech against Vatinius:<foreign xml:lang="la"> quod vero ad tabulam Valeriam pertinere
videatur, loci nomen sic ferebatur, quemadmodum ad tabulam Sestiam,
cuius meminit pro Quinctio, ita et ad tabulam Valeriam dicebatur, ubi
Valerius Maximus tabulam  rerum  ab se in Gallia prospere gestarum
proposuerat ostentui vulgo</foreign>, and is doubtless drawn from Pliny. Taking
this statement of a scholiast as a basis, Manutius conjectured that there
was a sort of tribunes' court 'ad tabulam Valeriam,' to which Terentia
was forced to go, presumably to answer for Cicero's property in some way,
and cited the passage from his speech in Vat. as a parallel, for here tabula
Valeria collegae tui may mean that this was an assembling place for the
tribunes, and that those who were gathered there prevented Vatinius
from casting Bibulus into prison. It is also known that the subsellia
tribunorum were near the basilica Porcia and, therefore, the curia (Suet.
Caes. 78; cf. Plut. Cato min. 5; Cic. pro Sest. 124). This is the view
that has been generally accepted (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 330-331; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 165</bibl>;
<bibl>Mitt. 1893, 93</bibl>; <bibl>AJP 1898, 406-412</bibl>).</p>
<p>(3) tabula Valeria was a bronze tablet on which were inscribed the
famous Valerio-Horatian laws, which concerned especially the office and
functions of the tribunes. This was set up in the forum, near the subsellia
tribunorum, in order that the tribunes might consult its provisions
whenever necessary, and hence it came to be used as an indication of
locality. In the same way tabula Sestia was a tablet containing a copy
of the Licinio-Sestian laws, which probably stood also at the west end
of the forum (O'Connor, <bibl>CP 1908, 278-284</bibl>).</p>
<p>The first of these explanations must be rejected; of the other two, the
latter seems a little more probable.</p>
</div>
<div xml:id="tabularium" type="entry">
<head>
<placeName>TABULARIUM</placeName>
</head>
<p> a repository for state archives, probably in large part those
belonging to the aerarium in the neighbouring temple of Saturn, that
was built by Q. Lutatius Catulus in <date value="-78">78 B.C.</date> on the south-east slope of the
Capitoline. Before its construction the <foreign xml:lang="greek">tameie=on a)gorano/mwn</foreign> was used
for the purpose of preserving the state records (see <ref target="atrium-publicum" n="U">ATRIUM PUBLICUM</ref>).
It is not mentioned in literature, but its identification is based on two
<pb n="507"/>
inscriptions, one copied by Signorili and Poggio (<bibl>CIL i. 737</bibl>=vi. 1314):
<foreign xml:lang="la">Q . Lutatius . Q . f . Q . n . Catulus . cos. substructionem  et  tabularium .
de . s . s . faciundum . coeravit . eidemque . probavit</foreign>; and the other still
partially preserved in one of the rooms of the building (CIL i². 736
=vi. 1133=31597): <foreign xml:lang="la">Q . Lu]tatius . Q . f . Q . n . C[atulus . cos . de . s]en . sent . faciundu[m .  coeravit.] eidemque . prob[avit]</foreign>. The second story
seems to have been added, or at least rebuilt, about the <date value="99">end of the first
century</date> (see below), but nothing else is known of the history of the
building until the reign of Boniface VIII (about <date value="1300">1300 A.D.</date>), when the
present tower at the north end was erected. Later, Michelangelo destroyed the entire upper and western part, and built the present Palazzo
del Senatore directly upon the ancient structure (<bibl>LS ii. 70</bibl>).</p>
<p>This building, trapezoidal in shape, occupied all the space between
the clivus Capitolinus on the south-west and the flight of steps (gradus
Monetae ?) which led up past the carcer to the arx on the north-east.
On the forum side the foundation wall began on the level of the area
Volcani, and the substructio (cf. inscription) consisted of this wall,
3.43 metres thick, with a series of six recesses out of which narrow windows
open, and a corridor between it and the tufa rock of the hill itself. This
corridor is now blocked at both ends and may always have been so.
Above this corridor of the substructio is the corridor of the first story
of the Tabularium proper, 5 metres wide and o1 high, extending the
whole length of the building and originally open at both ends, but not
connected with any other part. Its front was an arcade of the Doric
order, with engaged columns of peperino. There were eleven arches,
7.50 metres in height and 3.54-3.60 in width, all but one of which have
been walled up. This arcade afforded the means of communication
between the two portions of the Capitoline, and formed a striking architectural terminus for the forum. Its effect, however, was greatly marred
by the erection of the temple of Vespasian and the porticus Deorum
Consentium, and by the enlargement of the temple of Concord. All of
the second story was removed by Michelangelo, but the few fragments
that have been found indicate an arcade of the Corinthian order immediately above that of the first story. These fragments are apparently of
the Flavian period, but it is impossible to say whether this story was an
addition or restoration.</p>
<p>Behind the corridor of the first story are supporting walls and piers,
and one large hall on a higher level than the corridor, which probably
opened out on the Asylum. From this hall a long flight of sixty-six
steps, partly cut in the rock, leads down to the ground through a fine
arched doorway in the wall of the substructure. These steps have no
connection with any other part of the building, and afforded direct
access from the forum to the upper part of the Tabularium and the
summit of the Capitoline. When the temple of Vespasian was built, its
podium  effectually blocked the entrance to this staircase. On  the
<pb n="508"/>
north-east side of the Tabularium were two stories of rooms fronting
on the way up to the arx. Those of the first story opened into each
other, and were connected by a stairway with the corridor of the substruction. Part of the wall of the south-west side is still standing, with
a large rectangular niche opening on the clivus Capitolinus, which is
now used as the entrance; while a small piece of the travertine plinth
of the north-west fagade is preserved in the cellars of the Palazzo del
Senatore (<bibl>JRS 1919, 192</bibl>).</p>
<p>The masonry of the Tabularium shows the best republican workmanship. It is wholly of opus quadratum, with blocks uniformly two Roman
feet in height and width, and averaging four in length. They are laid
in alternate courses of headers and stretchers (emplecton), with a thin
layer of cement. The outer walls are of sperone (Gabine stone), the
bases and capitals of the half-columns and the imposts of the arches
of travertine, and the inner walls of Anio tufa; while most of the vaults
are of concrete. The building was once used as a storehouse for salt
and the inner walls have suffered much from corrosion.  For a complete

</head>
<p> a section of the most westerly part of the campus Martius-
<foreign xml:lang="la">in extremo Martio campo</foreign> (Fest. 329; <bibl>Zos. ii. 3</bibl>)-where it is enclosed
by the great bend of the Tiber. Its precise limits are not known, but it
surrounded the <ref target="dis-pater-et-proserpina-ara" n="U">DITIS PATRIS ET PROSERPINAE ARA</ref>  (q.v.), which was
discovered in 1888 between the Chiesa Nuova and the Piazza Sforza-
Cesarini, and presumably it extended to the river (Val. <bibl>Max. ii. 4</bibl>. 5;
Fest. 350, 351; Ov. <bibl>Fast. i. 500</bibl> ; Censorin. 17. 18; Liv. Epit. 49).
Hot springs and other traces of volcanic action led to the belief that here
was an entrance to the lower world, and to the establishment of the cult
of Dis pater and Proserpina. The legend of the discovery of the altar
of Dis twenty feet below the surface of the ground by a Sabine Valerius
is given by Valerius Maximus (loc. cit.; Fest. 329). The Tarentum is
usually mentioned in connection with the ludi saeculares, when sacrifices
were offered to Dis (see references cited, and Statius <bibl>Silv. i. 4</bibl>. 18; <bibl>iv. 1</bibl>. 38;
<bibl>Mart. i. 69</bibl>. 2; <bibl>iv. 1</bibl>. 8; <bibl>x. 63</bibl>. 3; Auson. Idyll. 16. 34; <bibl>CIL vi. 32328</bibl>,
15, acta lud. saec. Sev.). The usual and correct form is Tarentum, but
Terentum occurs now and then with false etymologies (Fest. 350: <foreign xml:lang="la">Terentum locus in campo Martio dicitur quod eo loco ara Ditis patris terra
occultaretur; 351: Terentum  in campo Martio lo(cum Verrius ait ab

word Tarentum  has yet been found (cf. Zielinski, Quaest. comicae,
<bibl>Petropoli 1887, 94</bibl>). The district was also called <foreign xml:lang="greek">purofo/ron pedi/on </foreign>(<bibl>Zos. ii. 3</bibl>; cf. Val. <bibl>Max. ii. 4</bibl>. 5: <foreign xml:lang="la">solo magis fumante quam ullas ignes
Habente</foreign>; see also HJ 477; Becker, Top. 628-629; Jord. i. I. 181). It
has recently been maintained that the Tarentum must be sought much
closer to the river, and that it must be a subterranean shrine, resembling
the so-called mundus on the Palatine (<bibl>Mel. 1925, 135-146</bibl>). But it would
be difficult to point to any site in the Campus Martius where these two
conditions would be fulfilled; there is no rock in which such a shrine
could have been excavated, and it would have been liable to frequent
inundations.</p>

<placeName>TARPEIUS, MONS</placeName>
</head>
<p> the earliest name of the Capitoline hill, if we are to
believe the statements of Roman and Greek writers (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 41</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la">hic mons ante Tarpeius dictus a virgine Vestali Tarpeia, quae ibi ab
Sabini necata armis et sepulta, cuius nominis monimentum  relictum

4</bibl>. 93; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 69</bibl>. 4; Plut. Rom. 18; Steph. Byz. 355). It is also
used of the whole hill, apparently, in Not. app. (montes VII . . Tarpeius)
and in Auct. de vir. ill. (ii. 7), while in other passages it might refer to the
whole hill or, more probably, only to the Capitolium (<bibl>Liv. i. 55</bibl>; Suet.
Iul. 44; cf. ad <bibl>Her. iv. 43</bibl>;<foreign xml:lang="la"> denominatio est quae ab rebus propinquis
et Onitimis trahit orationem, qua possit intelligi res quae non suo vocabulo
sit appellata. id aut ab inventione conficitur ut si quis de Tarpeio
loquens eum Capitolium nominet</foreign>). The corresponding Greek name was
<foreign xml:lang="greek">*tarph/ios lo/fos</foreign>, which occurs with some frequency (<bibl>Dionys. iii. 69</bibl>. 4;
<bibl>iv. 60</bibl>.3,4; 61. I; <bibl>vii. 35</bibl>. 4; Plut. Rom. 18, Numa 7; Steph. Byz. 355),
or <foreign xml:lang="greek">o)/ros</foreign> (Cas. Dio, fr. vii. I . 5; Steph. Byz. 604; Lyd. de mens. iv. 155).</p>
<p>From the precipitous cliffs of this hill criminals, convicted of capital
crimes, were hurled to their death (<bibl>Gell. xi. 18</bibl>. 8; xx. I. 53), and these
cliffs were regularly called Tarpeium  saxum  (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 41</bibl>; <bibl>Liv.
vi. 20</bibl>. 12; Fest. 340; cf. ib. 343; Tac. Ann. vi. (19) 25; de vir. ill. xxiv.
6; <bibl>lxvi. 8</bibl>; <bibl>Ampel. xxvii. 4</bibl>; <bibl>Prop. iii. 11</bibl>, 45), saxum  alone (<bibl>Liv.
xxv. 7</bibl>. 13; Sen. contr. i. 3. 3, 4) or Tarpeium alone (Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 143</bibl>).
Twice Tarpeius is used alone, with reference to other things than executions, where mons is probably to be supplied (Plin. <bibl>NH xxviii. 15</bibl>; Tert.
de spect. 5). Other variants in Latin poetry are arx Tarpeia (Verg.
<bibl>Aen. viii. 652-654</bibl>; <bibl>Prop. iv. 4</bibl>. 29-30), and Tarpeia sedes (Verg. <bibl>Aen.
viii. 347</bibl> and cf. supra, 55, 97).</p>
<p>The alleged tradition that the Capitoline was first called mons Tarpeius
was probably only an invention of the Roman antiquarians, and
<pb n="510"/>
Tarpeius was most probably, according to the general rule in such cases,
derived from that of a gens Tarpeia, some of whom lived in the immediate
neighbourhood, and one of whose women was the heroine of the myth
of Tarpeia which circulated in so many versions.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> There was a statue of Tarpeia in the temple of Jupiter in the Porticus Metelli (Fest. 363).
</note> For some discussion of
this question and references to the abundant literature, see Sanders,
Univ. of Michigan Studies, i. I-47; Pais, Anc. Legends 96-108; Storia 12.
430, 538; Rev. Arch. 1908, i. 64-74; <bibl>Rosch. v. 111-116</bibl>.</p>
<p>That Tarpeius mons continued in use to some extent is shown by
an inscription of <date value="259">259 A.D.</date> (<bibl>NS 1892, 407</bibl>; <bibl>CIL vi. 37170</bibl>: deae Virgini
Caelestis praesentissimo numini loci montis Tarpei), and there seems
to be no doubt that it was sometimes applied to the whole Capitoline
hill, but, like Capitolinus, that it was also used of the southern summit
alone.</p>
<p>Rupes Tarpeia is clearly identified by Varro (LL, v. 41) with saxum
Tarpeium, but nowhere in extant Latin literature is this name found in
connection with the execution of criminals. In several passages it is
closely connected with the cult of Jupiter (Sil. <bibl>Ital. iii. 623</bibl>; <bibl>x. 360</bibl>;
Prop. iv. I. 7; Claud. 28. 45; Firm. Mat. math. i. 10. 17), once with the
temple of Saturn (<bibl>Lucan iii. 154</bibl>), once it occurs with no topographical
indication (<bibl>Liv. vi. 17</bibl>. 4), while Tacitus (<bibl>Hist. iii. 71</bibl>) connects it with
the centum gradus, of which nothing further is known. The equivalent
of rupes in Greek seems to be <foreign xml:lang="greek">krhmno/s</foreign> (<bibl>Dionys. vii. 35</bibl>. 4; <bibl>viii. 78</bibl>, 5), or <foreign xml:lang="greek"> pe/tra</foreign> (Plut. Rom. 18).</p>
<p>There has been much divergence of opinion as to the position of this
saxum from which criminals were thrown, but the unequivocal statement
that it overhung the forum (<bibl>Dionys. vii. 35</bibl>. 4; <bibl>viii. 78</bibl>. 5), and that
executions could be seen by all the people assembled there, together with
the close connection between rupes Tarpeia and the temple of Jupiter,
point clearly to the cliffs at the south-west corner of the hill, over the
ancient vicus Iugarius and the modern Piazza della Consolazione.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Jordan (Capitol, Forum, und Sacra Via, 5) makes a good point in noticing that the
saxum, from which traitors (perfidi) were thrown, was close to the temple of <ref target="fides-aedes" n="U">FIDES</ref> (q.v.):
see Hiilsen in Festschrift f r Kiepert, 215, and plan.
</note> A
recent attempt to locate the saxum  on the arx (Pais, Anc. Legends
109-127) is unsuccessful, and takes no account of Suetonius (Iul. 44),
where Tarpeius mons at any rate could not possibly mean the arx overlooking the forum. For further discussion and literature, see <bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>.

enough in the circumstances. It was doubtless built at once, although
its erection is ascribed to the city or senate in two sources (Val. <bibl>Max.
vi. 3</bibl>.  ; <bibl>Dionys. viii. 79</bibl>). It was on the Esquiline, in Carinis (Suet.
de gramm. 15; Dionys. loc. cit.; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 361</bibl>), on the site formerly
occupied by the house of <ref target="spurius-cassius-domus" n="U">SP. CASSIUS</ref> (q.v.), which was said to have been
pulled down in <date value="-495">495 B.C.</date> (Cic. de domo II ; <bibl>Liv. ii. 41</bibl>. II; Val. Max.

<bibl>B.C. ii. 126</bibl>) and that of <ref target="q-cicero-domus" n="U">Q. CICERO</ref> (q.v.). The latter restored the temple
about <date value="-54">54 B.C.</date> (Cic. ad Q. fr. iii. I. 4; de har. resp. 31), and apparently
gained possession of some of the land hitherto belonging to the temple.
The day of dedication was 13th December (Fast. Ant. ad Id. Dec., CIL
is. p. 249, 336), when Ceres was associated with Tellus as on other occasions
(WR 192-195). The fact that the worship of Tellus was very ancient
makes it probable that there was a much earlier cult centre on the site
afterwards occupied by the temple.</p>
<p>The temple was sometimes used for meetings of the senate (Cic.
<bibl>Phil. i. 31</bibl>; ad <bibl>Att. xvi. 14</bibl>. 1; App. <bibl>BC ii. 126</bibl>; Plut. Brut. 19; Cass. <bibl>Dio

Malerei in Rom, p. 8). It was standing in the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> (Not.

probably between the present Vie del Colosseo and dei Serpenti (<bibl>Gilb.

<p> a shrine in the cella of Jupiter himself
(<bibl>Dionys. iii. 69</bibl>), the central one in the great temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,
perhaps consisting only of the rude stone that represented Terminus
(Serv. <bibl>Aen. ix. 446</bibl>; Lact. inst. i. 20, 37; Aug. de civ. <bibl>Dei iv. 23</bibl>), above
which there was an opening in the roof (Fest. 368; Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 671</bibl>, 672;
Serv. loc. cit.). At least as early as the <date value="-199">beginning of the second century
B.C.</date> the presence of this cult was explained by the legend that there
were shrines or altars on this site of several deities who, when the
ground was desired for the temple of Jupiter, allowed themselves to be
dispossessed, except Terminus whose refusal to be moved was regarded
as a prophecy of the permanence of the cult and of Rome itself (Cato
ap. Fest. 162; <bibl>Liv. i. 55</bibl>. 3-4; Ov. <bibl>Fast. ii. 667-678</bibl>; <bibl>Dionys. iii. 69</bibl>).
Later Juventas was joined with Terminus in the story (Flor. i. I. 7, 8;
<bibl>Liv. v. 54</bibl>. 7). The probable explanation is that the stone was a boundary
stone, a sign of Jupiter's function as the guardian of truth and loyalty,
and that the opening in the roof indicated his connection with the sky

as still in use (Lud. septem sap. 40), and it is mentioned in Not. (Reg. IX).
It had 11510o loca, or room for about 7700 spectators (<bibl>BC 1894, 320</bibl>).
Four small columns of onyx, set up by Balbus in his theatre, were regarded
at that time as very wonderful (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxvi. 60</bibl>). The location of
this building near the Tiber, directly north of the upper end of the island,
is indicated by the slight elevation known in the Middle Ages as the
Monte dei Cenci. It occupied part at least of the ground covered by the
Palazzo Cenci, the buildings between it and the Via Arenula, and the
Piazza Cenci. The curve of the cavea was nearly tangent to the Via
Arenula, and its main axis ran northwest-southeast. The theatre is
marked on two fragments of the Marble Plan (FUR fig. 29; BC 1899, pl. i. No. 23; Atti del Congresso storico i. I 7 ; HJ 519-521).</p>

<p>*  Julius Caesar planned to build a theatre (Suet.

Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 49</bibl>. 2; <bibl>liii. 30</bibl>. 5), and to make room for it he removed
the temple of <ref target="pietas-aedes-2" n="U">PIETAS</ref> (q.v.) in the forum Holitorium and other shrines
and private houses (Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 21</bibl> ; Cass. <bibl>Dio xliii. 49</bibl>. 3), but the
building was not actually constructed by him but by Augustus, who
found it necessary to purchase additional land from private owners at his
own expense (Mon. <bibl>Anc. iv. 22</bibl>). The theatre was a memorial of Marcellus
and dedicated in his name (Cass. Dio, Mon. Anc. locc. citt.; Liv. Epit. 138;
Suet. Aug. 29; Plut. Marc. 30). In <date value="-17">17 B.C.</date> the work of construction was
so far advanced that part of the celebration of the ludi saeculares took
place within the theatre (<bibl>CIL vi. 32323</bibl>. 157 ;<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Here it is called' <foreign xml:lang="la">theatrum [quod est] in circo Flaminio</foreign>.'

dedication did not occur until 13 (Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 26</bibl>. i), or less probably II
(Plin. <bibl>NH viii. 65</bibl>; cf. Chron. Pasch. a. u. c. 732, ed. <bibl>Momms. i. 218</bibl>).
On this occasion magnificent games were held (Cass. <bibl>Dio liii. 30</bibl>. 6;
<bibl>liv. 26</bibl>. I; Suet. Aug. 43). Augustus placed four remarkable marble
columns from the house of Scaurus on the Palatine 'in regia theatri ' (Asc.
in Scaur. 45), but whether this was the middle door in the scaena, as was
.probably the case in the theatre of <ref target="cn-pompeius-domus" n="U">POMPEIUS</ref> (q.v.), or one of the halls
at the ends of the scaena (see below), is uncertain (LR 498; <bibl>BC 1901, 56</bibl>).
Besides the ordinary form of the name, the theatre was also called theatrum

<p>Vespasian restored the scaena (Suet. Vesp. 19), which had perhaps
been injured when the Vitellians stormed the Capitol, and Alexander
Severus is said to have intended to restore it again (Hist. Alex. Sev. 44),
<pb n="514"/>
but of this nothing more is known. Martial mentions this theatre with
that of Pompeius as one of the notable structures of the city (x. 51. 11);
and parts of the ludi saeculares of Severus were celebrated in it, as in
the games of Augustus (<bibl>CIL vi. 32328</bibl>, 33 ; <bibl>EE viii. 271</bibl>, 285). It is
found on sundry inscriptions as an indication of location (Fast. Allif.

<p>Some of the travertine blocks used in the restoration of the pons
Cestius in <date value="370">370 A.D.</date> were taken from this theatre (<bibl>NS 1886, 159</bibl>), which
may perhaps indicate that the destruction of the building had begun
by that time, although Petronius Maximus, prefect of the city, set up
statues within it in 421, and one inscribed pedestal was found in situ in
the <dateRange from="700" to="799">eighth century</dateRange> by the compiler of the Einsiedeln Itinerary (<bibl>CIL vi.

the ruins in 998, that the Fabii or Faffi were in possession of them as
early as the <date value="1150">middle of the twelfth century</date>, and held them until the end
of the thirteenth, when they were succeeded by the Savelli. It is very
doubtful, on the other hand, whether the Pierleoni had any connection
with the theatre. In 1368 it came into the possession of the Savelli family,
and in 1712 into that of the Orsini.  The present Palazzo was built
by Baldassare Peruzzi for the Savelli in the <date value="1500">early part of the sixteenth

<p>The theatre is represented on fragments (28, 112) of the Marble Plan,
and stands near the Tiber, on the north-west side of the forum  Holitorium. The stage is toward the river, and the main axis runs north-
north-east and south-south-west. It was built of travertine for the
most part, with opus reticulatum in the foundations and inner walls
(<bibl>AJA  1912, 393</bibl>), covered on the inside-and perhaps partly on the
outside-with stucco and marble. A little less than one-third of the
semi-circular exterior is still standing in the Via del Teatro di Marcello.
It was built with three series of open arcades, one above the other.
<pb n="515"/>
Between the arches of the lowest arcade are half-columns of the Doric
order, and above them is a Doric entablature with triglyphs and an
attic, 1.20 metre high, with projections that form the bases of the half-
columns of the second Ionic arcade. The entablature above these
columns consists of an architrave of three projecting ledges, with a
plain frieze and cornice. The original third arcade with Corinthian
pilasters has been entirely destroyed and replaced with modern masonry.
Thirteen piers, 3 metres wide and 2 thick, with their engaged columns,
are still standing, and were till lately buried to about one-third of their
height beneath the ground. Immediately within these piers was an
ambulatory running round the cavea, from which spur walls were built
on radial lines to support the tiers of seats. The construction of the
walls, seats, etc., as well as of the exterior, seems to have been quite like
that of the theatre of Pompeius and that which was afterwards developed
in the Colosseum. The arcades, ambulatories, and chambers between
the open walls have now been cleared. The diameter of the theatre was
about 150 metres, the scaena was about 80-9o metres long and 20 deep;
and at each end of the scaena was an apsidal hall, about 25 by 15 metres,
one of which may have been the regia (see above).</p>
<p>According to the Notitia, this theatre had 20500 loca, and if this is
interpreted to mean running feet of seats, as is usual at present, it would
accommodate from ten to fourteen thousand spectators (<bibl>BC 1894, 320</bibl>),
but much doubt attaches to these estimates of seating capacity (in
addition to literature cited see in general <bibl>BC 1901, 65-70</bibl>; HJ 515-519;

<p> * the first permanent theatre in Rome, built of stone
by Pompeius in his second consulship in <date value="-55">55 B.C.</date>, and dedicated in that
year according to the common version (Asc. in Pis. I; <bibl>Veil. ii. 48</bibl>;
Chron. Pasch. a. u. c. 697 (foundations laid); Chronica Min. ed. <bibl>Momms.
i. 215</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiv. 20</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio xxxix. 38</bibl>, whose story that a
freedman of Pompeius furnished the money is to be rejected), when
most elaborate games, contests of wild animals, and exhibitions of
marvels, were provided (Cic. in Pis. 65; Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 158</bibl>; <bibl>viii. 20</bibl>;
Plut. Pomp. 52). Besides the usual name, theatrum  Pompei, it was
called theatrum  Pompeianum (Plin. cit. xxxiv. 39; <bibl>xxxvi. 15</bibl>; Mon.
<bibl>Anc. iv. 9</bibl>; Suet. Tib. 47; Claud. 21; Tac. <bibl>Ann. vi. 45</bibl>; <bibl>Mart. vi. 9</bibl>;

(Plin. cit. vii. 158); and sometimes simply theatrum (Cic. ad Att. iv. I. 6;
Hor. <bibl>Carm. i. 20</bibl>. 3; Suet. Nero 13; <bibl>Flor. ii. 13</bibl>. 9 ; Cass. Dio 1. 8. 3), as
it was the only stone theatre in Rome until that of Marcellus was built
and always the most important (cf. Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiii. 54</bibl>; Plin. cit. xxxiii. 54;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lxii. 8</bibl>).</p>
<p>The plan of this building  Pompeius took from  that of Mitylene
<pb n="516"/>
(Plut. Pomp. 42), and within it he set up many wonderful statues (Plin.
cit. vii. 34; for the statues of the fourteen nations subdued by Pompeius
Plin. cit. xxxvi. 41; Suet. Nero 46; Serv. <bibl>Aen. viii. 721</bibl>; see <ref target="porticus-ad-nationes" n="U">PORTICUS
AD NATIONES</ref>).  To avoid censure for building a permanent theatre,
he constructed a temple of <ref target="venus-victrix" n="U">VENUS VICTRIX</ref> (q.v.) at the top of the central
part of the cavea, so that the rows of seats might appear to be the steps
leading up to the temple, and dedicated the whole as a temple and not
as a theatre (Tert. de spect. IO; Gell. x. I. 7; Plin. cit. viii. 20). Tertullian speaks of the dedication of theatre and temple as taking place
at the same time, but Gellius (loc. cit.) states that Pompeius, when
about to dedicate the temple, was uncertain whether to put consul
tertium or tertio in the inscription, and on the advice of Cicero (quoted
from a letter of Tiro) compromised on consul tert. This would seem to
indicate that the temple was dedicated in 52, not 53 (which is also the
statement of Chron. Pasch. a. u. c. 702; Chron. min. ed. Mommsen, i. 215).
Gellius, however, goes on to say that the inscription in theatre did not
read so in his day, <foreign xml:lang="la">nam cum multis annis postea scaena, quae prociderat,
refecta esset, numerus tertii consulatus non uti initio primoribus litteris
sed tribus tantum liniolis incisis significatus est</foreign>. Whatever may have
been true of the dedication, the inscription on the temple, or on the
temple and scaena both, was evidently put in place in <date value="-52">52 B.C.</date> From
the notice in two calendars (Fast. Allif. Amit. ad pr. Id. Aug., CIL i².
p. 217, 244, 324; cf. Suet. Claud. 2 : <foreign xml:lang="la">cum prius apud superiores aedes
supplicasset</foreign>) it appears that there were shrines or altars to three other
deities, Honor Virtus and Felicitas, similarly placed in the theatre, and
perhaps a fourth (Fast. Allif.: V. ... ?).</p>
<p>Augustus restored the theatre at great expense in <date value="-32">32 B.C.</date> (Mon. <bibl>Anc.
iv. 9</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">sine ulla inscriptione nominis mei</foreign>; cf., however, <bibl>CIL vi. 9404</bibl>:
<foreign xml:lang="la">in schola sub theatro Aug(usto) Pompeian(o)</foreign> ), and removed the statue
of Pompeius, before which Caesar had been murdered, from the <ref target="curia-pompei" n="U">CURIA
POMPEI</ref> (q.v.) to the theatre itself (Suet. Aug. 31: <foreign xml:lang="la">Pompei quoque

</note> It was burned in <date value="21">21 A.D.</date> (Hier.
a. Abr. 2037) and since there was no surviving member of the family
able to restore it, this was undertaken by Tiberius (Tac. <bibl>Ann. iii. 72</bibl>;
<bibl>Veil. ii. 130</bibl>; Sen. de cons. ad Marc. 22. 4), who set up a bronze statue
of Sejanus within the building (Cass. <bibl>Dio lvii. 21</bibl>. 3). Tiberius did
not complete the work of restoration (Suet. Tib. 47; Cal. 21), or, according
to another statement, did not dedicate it (Tac. <bibl>Ann. vi. 45</bibl>). The completion of the work is ascribed to Caligula (Suet. Cal. 21) or Claudius
(Suet. Claud. 21), and the dedication to the latter (Suet. Claud. 21;
Cass. <bibl>Dio lx. 6</bibl>. 8), who inscribed the name of Tiberius on the scaena and
built a marble arch in his honour (see <ref target="arcus-tiberii" n="U">ARCUS TIBERII</ref>) near the theatre
(Suet. Claud. II).
<pb n="517"/></p>
<p>In <date value="66">66 A.D.</date> when Tiridates, king of Armenia, visited Rome, Nero is
said to have gilded the scaena and the exterior of the theatre for that
one occasion, and to have stretched purple awnings over the cavea (Plin.
cit. xxxiii. 54; Cass. <bibl>Dio lxii. 6</bibl>. 1-2). In 80 the scaena was burned
(Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 24</bibl>. 2), but must have been repaired very soon. Under
Severus some restoration must have been carried out, for there are
two inscriptions of Q. Acilius Fuscus, who was procurator operis theatri
Pompeiani in <dateRange from="209" to="211">209-211 A.D.</dateRange> (<bibl>Pros. i. 6</bibl>. 47; <bibl>CIL viii. 1439</bibl>; <bibl>xiv. 154</bibl>;
cf. <bibl>NS 1880, 471</bibl>, and <bibl>CIL vi. 1031</bibl>). In <date value="247">247</date> the theatre was burned
again (Hier. a. Abr. 2263), and probably under Carinus (Hist. Aug.
Car. 19), for it was restored by Diocletian and Maximian (Chron. 148).
Other restorations are recorded, by Arcadius and Honorius (<bibl>CIL vi.
1191</bibl>, cf. 1193; <bibl>Mitt. 1899, 251-259</bibl>), and finally by Symmachus at the
command of Theodoric between 507 and 511 (Cassiod. <bibl>Var. iv. 51</bibl>; cf.
Sym. Rel. 8. 3). Successive restorations probably increased its magnificence, and it is mentioned among the notable monuments of the city
by Cassius Dio (xxxix. 38) and Ammianus Marcellinus (xvi. 10. 14:
<foreign xml:lang="la">inter decora urbis</foreign>). Immediately outside the south-east side of the
scaena was the <ref target="porticus-pompei" n="U">PORTICUS POMPEII</ref> (q.v.) for the use of the spectators
in case of rain. Other references to the theatre in ancient literature
convey no additional information (Tac. <bibl>Ann. xiii. 54</bibl>; <bibl>Mart. vi. 9</bibl>;
<bibl>x. 51</bibl>. I;  <bibl>xiv. 29</bibl>. 1, 166.  ; App. <bibl>BC ii. 115</bibl>; <bibl>v. 5</bibl>; Fest. 178; Plin.
cit. xxxvii. 19).</p>
<p>The theatre was in the campus Martius (Not. Reg. IX), a little north-
east of the circus Flaminius, and is represented on the Marble Plan
(frg. 30; see Jord. FUR 22-23). Its exact site is determined by the
remains in opus reticulatum of the foundations of the cavea (the church
of S. Maria de Crypta pincta (HCh 328) takes its name from one of the
vaults), of the temple of Venus Victrix, discovered under the Palazzo Pio,
and of the scaena in the Piazza dei Satiri (which takes its name, not
from the two satyrs now in the Capitol (Cortile 5, 23), but from a local
name Satro, HCh 204-205)  The Piazza di Grottapinta still preserves
the name and the form of part of the theatre. The fagade of the semi-circular cavea consisted of three series of arcades, adorned with columns,
the lowest arcade being of the Doric order, the second Ionic, and the
third Corinthian. Of the lower arcade traces of twenty-four arches of
peperino have been found, in front of which were columns of red granite.
The diameter of the theatre was 150-160 metres (cf. LF 23), and the
length of the scaena about 95 metres. According to Pliny (<bibl>NH xxxvi.
115</bibl>) the cavea seated 40,000 persons, but this, like other statements of
seating capacity in ancient literature, is open to question, and the most
careful estimate reduces this number to 10,000 (<bibl>BC 1894, 321</bibl>; for the
theatre and its remains, see also HJ 524-530; <bibl>Gilb. iii. 322-327</bibl>; <bibl>LS

<date value="-19">19 B.C.</date>, it is probable that the laconicum was the original part of what
afterwards became a complete establishment for bathing, which was
then  regularly  called thermae.  Agrippa adorned  these  baths with
works of art, among which are mentioned paintings (Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 26</bibl>),
and the Apoxyomenos of Lysippus, which was set up in front of them
(id. xxxiv. 62). The hot rooms he is said to have finished with fresco
on tiles (id. xxxvi. 189).</p>
<p>The thermae were burned in <date value="80">80 A.D.</date> (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxvi. 24</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="greek">balanei=on</foreign>),
but must have been restored by Titus or Domitian, for they are mentioned
by Martial (iii. 20. 15, 36. 6) as much frequented. Another restoration
was carried out by Hadrian (Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Romae instauravit
lavacrum  Agrippae</foreign>; cf. also a reference in <bibl>CIL vi. 9797</bibl>=AL 294).
An inscription <bibl>(vi. 1165)</bibl> of <date value="344">344</date>/<date value="355">5 A.D.</date> recording a restoration by Constantius and Constans of '<foreign xml:lang="la">termas vetustate labefactas</foreign>' was found near
the church of S. Maria in Monterone close' to the west side of the baths
of Agrippa, and therefore probably refers to them. They are mentioned
in the Regionary Catalogue (<rs key="regio9" type="region">Reg. IX</rs>), by Sid. Apollinaris (loc. cit.),
and in the <dateRange from="500" to="599">sixth century</dateRange> (Greg. Magn. <bibl>Reg. vi. 42</bibl>; <bibl>ix. 137</bibl>; <bibl>Kehr i. 98</bibl>).
By the <dateRange from="600" to="699">seventh century</dateRange> the destruction of the building was well under
way, and that its marble was burned into lime is shown by the name
Calcararium, applied to the immediate vicinity somewhat later (Mirabilia
23; <bibl>Jord. ii. 439</bibl>; <bibl>LS i. 25</bibl>). They are, however, mentioned as Thermae
Commodianae in Eins. 1. 4; 2. 4; 4. 8; 8. 6.</p>
<p>The general plan of these thermae is known from a fragment of the
Marble Plan found in 1900 (<bibl>NS 1900, 633-634</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1901, 3-19</bibl>; <bibl>LS ii. 209</bibl>;

meagre results of excavations (cf. <bibl>NS 1881, 276-281</bibl>; <bibl>1882, 351-359</bibl>).
From this evidence it appears that the building of Agrippa was oriented
of the	north and south on the axis of the Pantheon, and covered an  area measuring about 100-120 metres north and south and 80-100  east and
same	west, extending from the modern Via di Tor Argentina on the west to the east side of the Via dei Cestari, and having its southern limit a little north of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele.  Just north of the centre of the building was a circular hall about 25 metres in diameter, belonging to a later reconstruction in a period not earlier than Alexander Severus(RA 127, 128; 175, 176), with the earliest known example of meridian
ribs in its dome, the arco della Ciambella, by which name it was known as early as 1505 (<bibl>BC 1901, 16</bibl>), shown in sketches of the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange> (e.g. that of Giovannoli, BC 1901, pl. iv.) when it was still complete. It is now only partially preserved and is visible behind the houses in the Via dell' Arco della Ciambella. It was probably a sort of general
assembly hall, the social centre of the baths. The arrangement of the other rooms is uncertain, but the caldarium was probably directly west of the circular hall. On the west side of the thermae was an artificial pool or <ref target="stagnum-agrippae" n="U">STAGNUM</ref> (q.v.). The plan is very like that of the larger thermae(the so-called palace) at Treves (Trier), as the restoration by Williams shows (ASA 100).</p>
<p>The original structure of Agrippa was afterwards extended north by Hadrian, and connected with the Pantheon by a series of halls, of which only small sections have been found (<bibl>NS 1877, 271</bibl>; <bibl>1878, 93</bibl>; <bibl>1881, 278</bibl>;1886, 159; <bibl>BC 1886, 219</bibl>; <bibl>LS ii. 236</bibl>; <bibl>Mel. 1885, 3</bibl> ff., pi. i), except in the case of that directly adjoining the Pantheon. This hall is wrongly called Laconicum by Lanciani, for there are no traces of heating arrangements. Its real purpose is uncertain; Hulsen conjectures that it is to be identified with the library which Julius Africanus erected for the emperor Alexander Severus. But the passage in Oxyrhynchus Papyri (iii. p. 39)<note anchored="true" place="foot"> No. 412-a fragment of book viii. of the Keoroi of Africanus himself.

out by the character of the frieze and cornice.  Cf. <bibl>Toeb. i. 67-72</bibl>.

The hall, now cut through by the Via della Palombella, was rectangular
in shape, 45 metres long and 19 wide, with an apse 9 metres in diameter
in the north wall. Along each of the longer sides stood four columns
of pavonazzetto and red granite. Between the first and second and the
third and fourth columns on each side were three niches, two rectangular
and one semi-circular. Round the hall ran a remarkably well executed
frieze and cornice, some of which is in situ (Durm, fig. 437; D'Esp.
<bibl>Fr. i. 78</bibl>). The walls are 1.75 metre thick. The cross-walls between
the north wall of this hall and the drum of the Pantheon date from 126
or later (<bibl>AJA 1912, 421</bibl>), and as they are not connected with either
structure but simply abut against them, it is clear that they were
intended to serve as buttresses, perhaps in order that a heavy roof might
be put over the hall.</p>

cf. also Eutrop. 8. 20; Chron. 147.</p>
<p>The commencement of the building may be fixed by the fact that

<p>In the <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> the baths are named among the marvels of Rome

<p>The ruins were less affected than those of many other buildings by
the devastations of the Middle Ages, though evidence has been found
here too of the harm wrought by the earthquake of 847 (a column in
the xystus resting on a mass of debris; see <ref target="basilica-aemilia" n="U">BASILICA AEMILIA</ref>). The
name occurs in Eins. (11. 2; 13. 25) and under various forms (palatium
Antonianum, l'Antoniana, etc.) right through the Middle Ages. Discovery
and destruction went hand in hand under Paul III (LS passim; DAP
2. xv. 369). The colossal group of the Farnese Bull, and the large
statues of Hercules and Flora which were found in his pontificate, are
now  all in the Museum  at Naples.  After the important studies of
<dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> architects, no great progress was made until the
publication of Blouet's Restauration des thermes d'Antonin Caracalla

studied the ruins in 1847-49, but his results were only published in 1898,

up to 1897, see LR 535-543), and, in 1901 and 1911, in its subterranean
service and drainage passages, in the underground corridors which
connected it with the peribolus, and in parts of the latter (<bibl>NS 1901,

<p>The plan of the thermae of Caracalla is derived, with modifications,
from the thermae of Trajan; they consist of a large central building
containing the baths proper, surrounded by a garden, which in turn is
enclosed by a rectangular peribolus, containing porticoes, rooms for
recreation, etc. The via Nova ran below the level of this garden, which
was in large measure artificially raised, only the south and south-east
porticoes having been cut out of the hillside. It was therefore approached
by flights of steps; between them were small rooms in two stories which
served as shops and offices. These ran along the front and the sides,
almost as far as the back of the central building, where they were
succeeded by two huge exedrae, in each of which were three main rooms--<note anchored="true" place="foot"> CDE in the plan (fig. 1) in <bibl>NS 1912, 305</bibl>. C was paved with mosaic, and there was
no depression in the centre; the octagonal outline in Baumeister, 1772. pi. lxx., is intended
to represent the vaulting; and the suggestion that this was a laconicum (<bibl>Mitt. 1920, 168</bibl>,
169) may therefore be disregarded.
</note>
an octagonal nymphaeum (?) (which has great importance in the history
of the development of the dome, providing the earliest extant examples
of spherical pendentives of windows in the drum and of half-domed
recesses under them), a rectangular room open towards the garden,
and another room, previously thought to have been a piscina, but recently
found to have been heated by hypocausts (seen on the left of Ill. 50).
Behind these rooms was an arcade following the curve of the exedra;
and in front of each exedra was a portico which gave on to the garden,
and was continued along the south-west side as well (Mem. L. 5. xvii.
527).</p>
<p>We have now reached the posterior angles of the peribolus; in each
of them is a staircase (not a part of the original construction) followed
by a large rectangular hall open towards the garden, which from its
internal arrangements must be a library (Ill. 52).  On three sides it is
surrounded by low steps, leading up to niches, in which the manuscripts
were kept. Two capitals, with figures of Serapis and Harpocrates, now
in  S. Maria in  Trastevere, came from  here (DAP 2. xi. 174).  The
centre of the south-west side is occupied by rows of seats, with a curve
at each end.  Here was obviously a stadium; but the north-east side
was left open, so that spectators in the garden could see what was going
on. Behind the seats and at a higher level were the large reservoirs
of the thermae, consisting of sixty-four vaulted chambers in two stories
and in two rows. They were supplied by a branch of the <ref target="aqua-marcia" n="U">AQUA MARCIA</ref>,

<pb n="523"/>
the Antoniniana Iovia (q.v.), which crossed the via Appia on the so-called
<ref target="arcus-drusi-1" n="U">ARCH OF DRUSUS</ref> (q.v.).</p>
<p>The central block, to which we now turn, had four entrances: the
two central ones led into the covered halls (from which the apodyteria
or dressing-rooms were reached) at each end of the frigidarium. This,
despite all that has been said to the contrary, was probably open to
the air, like the frigidarium of the thermae of Diocletian. The famous
passage (Hist. Aug. Carac. 9. 4) as to the ' cella solearis,' which most writers
have identified with the frigidarium (while others have referred it to the
caldarium), is relegated by Domaszewski to the list of the writer's inventions (<bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl>. A, 7; <bibl>1918, 13</bibl>. A, 49). Thus solearis is an intentional corruption of soliaris, and the sentence : <foreign xml:lang="la">nam et ex aere vel cypro
cancelli superpositi esse dicuntur, quibus cameratio tota concredita
est</foreign>, is added by the author as an explanation of the word. As a matter
of fact, a cella soliaris (or cum soliis) is mentioned thrice in North Africa-
at Thuburnica, Madauros, and Thuburbo Maius (<bibl>CIL viii. 14700</bibl><note anchored="true" place="foot">=ib. 10607; cf. also 10608.
</note>; <bibl>Mel.
1909, 401</bibl>; <bibl>AA 1911, 277</bibl>; <bibl>CRA 1917, 72</bibl>)-and appears to mean a hall
in which were large basins for private hot baths. In some cases solium
is used for the room itself (<bibl>CIL viii. 897</bibl>, p. 928, 948). The north-east
(external) wall was elaborately decorated with small niches surmounted
by pediments and enclosed by ranges of columns carrying architraves,
one above the other-the first case of a form of embellishment, which is
also found in the frigidarium of the thermae of Diocletian. On the
south-west it opened on to the great central hall, which has so long
been wrongly known as the tepidarium, though no arrangements for
heating it are to be found; and it has so many openings that it would
be impossible to keep up even a moderate temperature in it. This great
hall (III. 51), which measures 183 by 79 feet, was covered with an intersecting barrel vault, and was adorned with eight granite columns,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For their remarkable capitals, see SScR 307-309.
</note> one
of which was still standing there until 1561-5, when it was removed to
Florence by Cosimo I, and now stands in the Piazza della Trinita (DuP 89).</p>
<p>The other two entrances at each end of the central block led into two
halls which gave directly on to the two palaestrae, one at each end of the
longer axis of the building. These were open courts surrounded by a
colonnade on three sides with a row of three rooms opening towards the
fourth side. On the axis of the central hall and opening out of it are
two apsidal recesses, each of which contained a large mosaic pavement
representing athletes, and dating probably from the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange>.
They were discovered in 1824, and placed in the Lateran museum, where
they have been somewhat arbitrarily re-arranged (HF ii. p. 1, No. 1240;
Nogara, Mosaici del Vat. e del Lat. pls. i.-iv.).</p>
<p>Two low openings on the minor axis of the central hall lead into
a small rectangular room, probably the tepidarium, which serves as the
<pb n="524"/>
vestibule to the great circular caldarium in the centre of the south-west
side. Its lofty dome (in which almost for the first time amphorae were
used to lighten the vault-the earliest instance within the city is in the
haunches of some of the barrel vaults in the substructions of Septimius
Severus on the Palatine, RA 164) was 35 metres in diameter, and was
supported by eight huge pillars, two of which are still standing. These
were united by two tiers of arches. Between the pillars on each side
of the entrance hot baths have been inserted at a later date, and were
supplied by cisterns added on each side of the tepidarium. Other private
baths were accessible from the palaestrae or were situated in the upper
story. The central block was completed by four rooms on the south-west
side on each side of the caldarium, which served for meeting places,
recitations, etc.</p>
<p>The planning of the subterranean portion of the baths is no less
admirable than that of the superstructure. It was studied in the excavations of 1901 and 1912, but no comprehensive plan is as yet available.
An elaborate system of tiewalls was introduced to strengthen the foundations. Under the whole of the main building run passages at two levels,
the upper for service, communication being by means of shafts, the lower
for drainage. The main discharge is on the north-west side from a drain
running the whole length of the north-east front, and receiving the
water from the frigidarium, which had two outlets in the centre. Another
important passage ran beneath the main axis of the building. These
passages are approached from open courtyards, which also served as light
wells, on each side of the tepidarium (both those immediately adjacent
to it and those marked MM on Ripostelli's and Lugli's plans are referred
to).</p>
<p>Along the south-west side of the building run far larger and more
extensive vaulted passages which communicated with the interesting
and complicated substructures of the two exedrae of the peribolus.
In one part of them a mill was established at a later date, when the baths
lost part of their importance; in another was placed a Mithraeum, the
largest known in Rome, which gives us interesting information as to
the details of the cult (NS 1912, cit.; PT 125).</p>

<p> the last of the great baths of Rome, built
by Constantine on the Quirinal, probably before 315 (Aur. Vict. Caes. 40 :<foreign xml:lang="la">a quo ad lavandum institutum opus ceteris haud multo dispar</foreign>; Not. Reg.
VI). They suffered greatly from fire and earthquake and were restored
in 443 by the city prefect Petronius Perpenna Magnus Quadratianus
(<bibl>CIL vi. 1750</bibl>), at which time it is probable that the colossal statues
of the Dioscuri and horses, now in the Piazza del Quirinale, were set
up within the thermae (<bibl>Mitt. 1898, 273-274</bibl>; <bibl>1900, 309-3</bibl>o0). The only
other reference to these baths in ancient literature is in Ammianus
Marcellinus (xxvii. 3. 8:<foreign xml:lang="la"> cum  collecta plebs infima  domum  prope
Constantinianum  lavacrum  iniectis facibus incenderat</foreign>), but they are
mentioned in Eins. (1. 10; 3.6; 7. 11).</p>
<p>They were built in the irregular space between the vicus Longus, the
Alta Semita, the clivus Salutis and the vicus laci Fundani, and as this
was on a side-hill, it was necessary to make an artificial level, beneath
which the ruins of houses of the second, third and fourth centuries have
been found (<bibl>BC 1876, 102-106</bibl>; cf. also <ref target="t-avidius-quietus-domus" n="U">DOMUS T. AVIDII QUIETI (b)</ref>,
<ref target="mucianus-domus" n="U">MUCIANI</ref>). Because of these peculiar conditions these thermae differed
in plan from all others in the city. Enough of the structure was standing
at the beginning of the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> to permit of plans and drawings
by the architects of that period, and these are the chief sources of our
knowledge of the building (see especially Serlio, <bibl>Architettura iii. 92</bibl>; <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Ed. 1550; in those of 1544 and 1562 the reference is iii. 88. In all these thermae are

remains were almost entirely destroyed in <dateRange from="1605" to="1621">1605-1621</dateRange>, when the Palazzo
Rospigliosi was built, but some traces were found a century later (<bibl>BC<pb n="526"/> 1895, 88</bibl>; HJ 440, n. 133), and since <date value="1870">1870</date> (<bibl>NS 1876, 55</bibl>, 99; <bibl>1877, 204</bibl>,

<p>The baths were oriented north and south (see LF 16) with one principal
entrance in the middle of the north side. As the main structure occupied
all the space between the streets on the east and west, the ordinary
peribolus was replaced by an enclosure that extended across the front
and was bounded on the north by a curved line, an area now occupied
by the Palazzo della Consulta. The other principal entrance was on
the west side, where a magnificent flight of steps led down from the
top of the hill to the campus Martius. The frigidarium seems to have had
its longer axis north and south instead of east and west, and behind it
were tepidarium and caldarium both circular in shape. Because of the
comparative narrowness of the building, the ordinary arrangement of
the anterooms on each side of the caldarium was not carried out.</p>
<p>Some notable works of art have been found on the site of these
thermae, among them the bronze statues of boxer and athlete now in
the Museo delle Terme <note anchored="true" place="foot"> The torso of the Belvedere should probably be added (HF 124; cf. <bibl>RhM 1894, 423</bibl>;

<p>A partial plan of these thermae drawn by Palladio about 1600 was
found by Lanciani in the Devonshire collection (portfolio 15, pl. 81;
LR fig. 210), on which can be traced the outlines of the central hall,
the beginning of the caldarium, and the dressing and lounging rooms
on the sides, in the usual manner of the Roman baths. This main part
<pb n="527"/>
seems to have measured about 70 by 35 metres, which shows that the
whole complex of buildings was very large.</p>
<p>The site of the thermae was between the present churches of S. Alessio
and S. Prisca, in the Vigna Torlonia, and Palladio's plan corresponds
with the remains of foundation walls still existing under and around
the casino of the vigna. Excavations on this site since the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth
century</dateRange> have resulted in the discovery of large halls with mosaic pavements and painted marble and stucco decoration (Bartoli, Mem. 125,
127, 129; Vacca, Mem. 90; Ficoroni, Mem. 22), of inscribed pedestals
of statues erected during the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century</dateRange> by prefects of the city

<p> the baths erected by Diocletian on the high ground
to the north-east of the Viminal. The dedicatory inscription  (CIL
vi. I 130=31242) of which at least four copies were set up runs as follows:<foreign xml:lang="la">D(omini) n(ostri) Diocletianus et Maximianus invicti seniores Aug(usti),
patres imp(eratorum) et Caes(arum), et d(omini) n(ostri) Constantius
et Maximianus invicti Aug(usti), et Severus et Maximinus nobilissimi
Caesares ... thermas felices Diocletianas, quas Maximianus Aug. rediens
ex Africa sub praesentia maiestatis disposuit ac fieri iussit et Diocletiani
Aug. fratris sui nomine consecravit, coemptis aedeficiis pro tanti operis
magnitudine omni cultu perfectas Romanis suis dedicaverunt</foreign>. Maximian's return to Rome took place in the autumn of 298; while the
abdication of Diocletian and  Maximian  in  favour of Constantius
(Chlorus) and (Galerius) Maximianus took place on Ist May, 305, and
Constantius died on 25th July, 306. The inscription therefore belongs
to the period between the two latter dates, and the baths took between
seven and eight years to complete. It is noteworthy that the bricks
used belong entirely to the period of Diocletian, no older material having
been employed.  The exterior (like that of the thermae of Caracalla
and of the curia) was faced with white stucco in imitation of construction
in blocks of white marble. The date given by Hier. a. Abr. 2318 (<date value="302">302 A.D.</date>),
cf. Chron. 148, is therefore incorrect. The baths are also mentioned
in Not. (Reg. VI) and in Hist. Aug. (xxx. Tyr. 21), where we are told
that the <ref target="quadrigae-pisonis" n="U">QUADRIGAE PISONIS</ref> (q.v.) were among the buildings removed
to make way for the baths. We may add a monument of an undetermined
period,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> For the date see p. 439, and n. I.

the temple of Quirinus (<bibl>Mitt. 1904, 23-37</bibl>), and various private houses,

and HF i, ii; cf. <bibl>RhM 1894, 383</bibl>, 388).</p>
<p>The statement in Hist. Aug. Prob. c. 2:<foreign xml:lang="la"> usus autem sum praecipue
libris ex bibliotheca Ulpia, aetate mea thermis Diocletiani</foreign>, is a pure
invention according to v. Domaszewski (<bibl>SHA 1916, 7</bibl>. A, 9). If it is true
that these thermae could accommodate 3000 people in marble seats,
almost double the number of bathers that found room  in those of
Caracalla (Olympiod. ap. Phot. 80, p. 63 a, Bekker, v. p. 521), then,
inasmuch as the area is about the same, the space must have been
more economically used.  They are also mentioned  by Schol. <bibl>Iuv.
xi. 56</bibl>, and Sidon. ad Consent. 495. <bibl>CIL vi. 1131</bibl> (the date of which
is uncertain) refers apparently  to  a restoration, saying  '<foreign xml:lang="la">thermas
Diocletianas a veteribus principibus institutas omn[i cultu ... restituit]</foreign>.'
The destruction of the aqueducts in the Gothic wars naturally rendered
them unusable; but they are mentioned as in the fourth ecclesiastical
region in Regest. Honor. i. a. 625 ap. Deusdedit (iii. c. 138); and the
name in thermis Diocletianis was applied to the church of S. Cyriacus
right through the Middle Ages (HCh 245, 246), while in the Mirabilia (27)
and in Magister Gregorius (<bibl>JRS 1919, 52</bibl>) the building is known as the
Palatium Diocletiani.</p>
<p>The thermae of Diocletian (Ill. 54, a view taken shortly after the
construction of the first railway station) occupied about the same area
as those of Caracalla (a rectangle of about 356 by 316 metres, or about
281 acres) and closely resemble them in plan. The central hall of the
main building, which measured 280 by 160 metres, wrongly known as
the tepidarium until quite recently, is derived, as Rivoira points out,
from that of the thermae of Titus and of Trajan, and is very similar to
that of the baths of Caracalla; while from it is derived the plan of the
Basilica of Constantine. Its excellent preservation is due to its conversion
into the church of S. Maria degli Angeli by Michelangelo; though there
is not sufficient evidence to allow us to attribute to him, instead of to
Vanvitelli, the new apse on the north-east side (cf. Roma iii. <bibl>(1925)</bibl>, 349-
356, 395-408). It has an intersecting vault divided into three bays; the
four columns of grey granite on each side do not support the vault,
but are purely ornamental. The four smaller rooms at the angles may
havc served for cold baths, as there is no trace of heating; while
between them, on the minor axis, there was access to the frigidarium
on the north-east and to the circular tepidarium  (now the vestibule of
the church) and the rectangular caldarium, which projected south-
westwards, and  though  extant in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>  is  now
destroyed; see DuP 127.</p>
<p>On the major axis, on the south-west, there was an approach at each

<pb n="529"/>
end through two rectangular halls (on each side of which were others) to
the palaestrae, one at each end of the main block on each side of the
frigidarium, a hall containing a huge shallow bathing pool, which was
open to the air; its north wall, elaborately decorated with niches, is
still in great part preserved; see Piranesi, Vedute di Roma, No. 115
Hind, and 111. 53. On each side of the caldarium were the apodyteria
or dressing rooms, and other halls, which served for private baths, etc.,
as well as for conversation, recitations of poets, rhetoricians, etc.,
and completed the rectangular central block.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> The identification of the rooms at the south-east and south-west angles as laconica
(<bibl>Mitt. 1920, 168</bibl>) is incorrect.
</note>  This was surrounded
by a garden, which was enclosed by an outer peribolus.  Around this
were small rectangular halls and semicircular exedrae, which were also
used as reading and lecture rooms, gymnasia and lounging rooms.</p>
<p>In the centre of the south-west side was a very large exedra, which
was doubtless provided with seats and served as a theatre (like the
corresponding exedrae in the thermae of Trajan and Caracalla).</p>
<p>The actual enclosure wall was preserved until modern days. The Via
Nazionale was driven through it in 1867, and only the line of its curve is
still shown by the buildings of the Piazza dell' Esedra dei Termini, the
corrupt form in which the name of the thermae still lingers on. At the
west and south angles of the peribolus are two circular halls, one of
which is especially well preserved, owing to its conversion into the church
of S. Bernardo in 1598.<note anchored="true" place="foot"> See S. Ortolani, San Bernardo alle Terme (Chiese di Roma illustrate, No. 8; Rome, n.d.).
</note></p>
<p>The whole of the external brick facing was covered with plaster, in
imitation of construction in blocks of white marble with draughted
joints: this was also done in the thermae of Caracalla, the basilica of
Constantine, etc.</p>
<p>The reservoir by which the baths were supplied was fed by the aqua
Marcia, the volume of which was increased by Diocletian (see p. 27).
It lay outside the peribolus on the south side; and, being in the angle
between the baths and the vicus Collis Viminalis, it was trapezoidal in
shape, 91 metres in length, with an average width of 16 metres. The
last remains of it above ground were not destroyed until 1876 (Falda,
Giardini di Roma, 14; LA 308, 318; BC 1872-3, 230; <bibl>1906, 106-107</bibl>;

hill, between the amphitheatrum Castrense and the arcus Neroniani of
the aqua Claudia, and are now bounded by the Vie di S. Croce in Gerusalemme and Eleniana.  They are almost entirely destroyed.  They
are commonly ascribed to Helena, the mother of Constantine, on the
evidence of an inscription found among the meagre ruins on this site
(<bibl>CIL vi. 1136</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> d.n. He[lena venerabilis do]mini [n. Constantini A]ug.

records only a restoration, and there is no actual occurrence of the
name thermae Helenae. In 1907 a fragmentary inscription was discovered in the cloister of S. Croce in Gerusalemme which contained a
list of distinguished men of the time of Maximian, with certain sums
opposite their names, and it has been conjectured that this may be a
list of men who made voluntary contributions to construct the baths
which Helena afterwards restored (<bibl>BC 1907, 114-121</bibl>). In the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth

Antonio da Sangallo the younger (Uffizi, 1439; cf. LF 31, 32). On
the north-east side of the thermae are the ruins of a piscina, fed probably
by the aqua Alexandrina, with vaulted chambers, in one of which was
a church during the Middle Ages with painted walls (<bibl>Mitt. 1892, 273</bibl>;

<p> baths on the Aventine in <rs key="regio13" type="region">Region XIII</rs> (Not. Cur.

Trajan himself and dedicated in the name of his friend (Vict. Caes. 13;
Epit. 13). This establishment is represented on fragments of the Marble
Plan (FUR 41, 258, 329, 387; Atti del Congresso storico i. 49), and its
site is thereby identified with that of the modern restaurant of the
Castello dei Cesari, just north of S. Prisca, where some remains have

<pb n="533"/>
been found and a fragmentary inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 1703</bibl>) recording the
restoration of a cella tepidaria by Caecina Decius Acinatius Albinus,
praefectus urbi in <date value="414">414 A.D.</date> (cf., however, Merlin 433, who makes this
inscription refer to the thermae Decianae). A previous restoration by
the third Gordian is proved by the discovery in 1920 in S. Sabina of part
of a marble block, probably the architrave over a door, with a fragmentary
inscription-<foreign xml:lang="la">Imp. Caes. Marcus Antonius [Gordianus Augustus] Balneum
Surae o[rnandum curavit]</foreign>-in which this restoration of the text seems
justified, especially when compared with a passage from  Hist. Aug.
Gord. 32. 5:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Opera Gordiani Romae nulla extant praeter quaedam

house on the Aventine, presumably close to the thermae (<bibl>Mart. vi. 64</bibl>.
12-13), or perhaps converted into them by Trajan (but see <bibl>RE xiii. 481-2</bibl>).
The latter are not mentioned after the fourth century (HJ 156-157;

AUREA (q.v.) (Mart. Spect. 2:<foreign xml:lang="la"> hic ubi miramur velocia munera thermas

domus seem to have been removed to make room for them. In <date value="238">238 A.D.</date>
some restoration was evidently contemplated (Hist. Aug. Max. et Balb. I),
and incidental references to them occur in Martial (iii. 20. 15; 36. 6) and

<p>Early in the <dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange> Julius II brought to the Vatican a

and still stands in the Cortile di Belvedere (<bibl>PBS ii. 26</bibl>; HJ 308; Jahrb.
d. <bibl>Inst. 1890, 59</bibl>). Later on, a basin of porphyry was found here and
given by Ascanio Colonna to Julius III. It is now in the Sala Rotonda
of the Vatican. In the same century Palladio made a plan of the ruins
then existing (Devonshire coll. portf. v.; <bibl>BC 1895, 110-113</bibl>). These
ruins were afterwards almost entirely destroyed, although some meagre
remains have recently been found (<bibl>BC 1895, 113-115</bibl>; cf. <bibl>LS iii. 248</bibl>),
and until 1895 the name was generally applied to the thermae of Trajan,
<pb n="534"/>
though the truth was detected by De Romanis and Piale in the 'twenties
of last century (see <ref target="aurea-domus" n="U">DOMUS AUREA</ref>). The thermae were situated just
west of the later thermae Traianae on the edge of the slope overhanging
the Colosseum, with the same orientation as the domus Aurea, and
occupied a nearly rectangular area, about 105 by 120 metres. The
facade and principal entrance were on the north side. On the south side
a wide flight of steps led down to the paved area around the Colosseum,
18 metres below, where there are traces of a porticus which may have
belonged to the approach to the thermae or have surrounded a large
part of the Colosseum area (<bibl>BC 1895, 118-121</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1895, 201</bibl>, 226). The
arrangement of apartments seems to have been somewhat like that of
the <ref target="thermae-neronianae" n="U">THERMAE NERONIANAE</ref>  (q.v.), with the main hall (the earliest
example) in the centre of the north side flanked by colonnaded courts,
and a caldarium projecting out from the south side (HJ 309-310; LR

These baths were  immediately
north-cast of the thermae Titi, and in the chronicle of S. Jerome
(a. Abr. 2105) the thermae Titianae et Traianae are assigned to
the reign of Domitian, which may perhaps indicate that the latter
were planned  by  that emperor.  Because of this statement these
baths are mentioned in early church writings as thermae Domitianae
(cf. <bibl>LP xxxiv. 33</bibl>; <bibl>liii. 9</bibl>; <bibl>Mel. 1886, 3-4</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1886, 245</bibl>; Mon. <bibl>L. i.
484-485</bibl>). In Trajan's time they were used by women (Chron. 146:<foreign xml:lang="la">hoc imperatore mulieres in thermis Traianis laverunt</foreign>); little images
(sigillaria) were exposed for sale in the porticus of the thermae in the
last days of the Saturnalia (which were sometimes called Sigillaria from
this practice; see <ref target="sigillaria" n="U">SIGILLARIA</ref>) (Schol. ad Iuv. 6. 154); they are mentioned
incidentally in inscriptions (vi. 9797=AL 29. 4; 8677, 8678); and in
the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth</dateRange> or <dateRange from="400" to="499">fifth century</dateRange> they were adorned with statues by Iulius
Felix Campanianus, prefect of the city (<bibl>CIL vi. 1670</bibl>). The correct
name was attached to the gradually diminishing ruins until about the
<dateRange from="1500" to="1599">sixteenth century</dateRange>, when it was displaced by the incorrect name, thermae
Titianae.</p>
<p>Part of these baths is represented on a fragment of the Marble
Plan (109; cf. Lanciani quoted by Gatti, <bibl>BC 1886, 272-274</bibl>), and in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries drawings and plans were made of
the existing ruins-the most important being those in the Destailleur
collection in Berlin<note anchored="true" place="foot"> In the Kunstgewerbemuseum (Jessen in Aus der Anomia <bibl>(1890)</bibl>, 14 sqq.).
</note> (cf. <bibl>Mitt. 1892, 302-304</bibl>; HJ 313, n. 72). By the
<pb n="535"/>
end of the <dateRange from="1700" to="1799">eighteenth century</dateRange> most of these ruins had been destroyed,
and the principal remains now visible belong to the exedrae at the
north-east and south-west corners of the east palestra. These baths
were in <rs key="regio3" type="region">Region III</rs> (Not.), on the Esquiline, just south-east of the present
church of S. Pietro in Vincoli. They were within the precinct of the
domus Aurea, a considerable part of which was destroyed or buried
beneath them. From information at hand it is possible to reconstruct
their plan in its main features (see LF pls. 23, 30; LR, fig. 138 (text fig. 7)).
These thermae marked an intermediate stage between the earlier and
later type, in that the central complex of buildings was partly surrounded,
on the east, west, and south sides, by a peribolus which contained reading
rooms, gymnasia, and exedrae at the four corners. On the north side
there was no enclosure, but the facade of the building with the main
entrance in the middle. The frigidarium, central hall, tepidarium, and
caldarium  <note anchored="true" place="foot"> Hulsen points out that the placing of the caldarium in such a position as to give it
as much of the sun's heat as possible, by orientating the building from north-west to south-
east, was a most important innovation, which was followed in subsequent edifices of the
kind.
</note> were arranged in the usual order from north to south in the
centre of the main structure, with apodyteria or dressing-rooms, open
courts or palaestrae surrounded with colonnades in the middle of the
east and west sides, and the usual number of small baths and rooms for
various purposes. From the middle of the peribolus on the south side, a
very large exedra projected outward which served as a theatre. This
exedra was built over part of the domus Aurea, and in order to provide
sufficiently strong foundations for the cavea of the theatre, additional
<pb n="536"/>
walls were built through the chambers of the domus, some corresponding
with the walls of these chambers, and others with the orientation of the
baths themselves. The axis of the domus runs north and south, while
that of the thermae runs north-east and south-west at an angle of
30 degrees from the meridian. The extreme measurements of the baths
are 340 metres in width and 330 in depth, or, excluding the exedral
projections, 280 by 210 metres.</p>
<p>Presumably Trajan adorned his baths with works of art, and many
traces have been found in this precinct and its immediate vicinity, but
their exact provenience is difficult to ascertain. The Laokoon group
was found in 1506 in a hall<note anchored="true" place="foot"> Numbered 80 on Weege's plan.

(probably in the domus Aurea, which in Pliny's time was called the house
of Titus; see <ref target="titus-flavius-vespasianus-domus" n="U">DOMUS TITI</ref>). It may have been set up in the thermae
by Trajan, but it seems far more likely that it was actually found in the
domus Aurea (for excavations and discussions, see <bibl>LS ii. 222-228</bibl>; LR

<placeName>TIBERIS</placeName>

<p> the most important river of Central Italy. The importance of
the site of the Palatine and of Rome is mainly due to its command of the
crossing of the Tiber just below the island (see <ref target="pons-sublicius" n="U">PONS SUBLICIUS</ref>), which
must be of great antiquity, and was probably the only one in the whole
lower course of the river.</p>
<p>The derivation of the name is uncertain (Varro, <bibl>RR iii. 16</bibl>; <bibl>LL v. 30</bibl>;
Serv. ad <bibl>Aen. viii. 332</bibl>), but its antiquity is vouched for by its appearance
<pb n="537"/>
in the augural books (Cic. de nat. deor. iii. 20). It was also known as
Albula, though it is incorrect to connect the name with albus (as Servius
ad Aen. cit. and Festus 4 do). Hiilsen connects it with the Ligurian
root ALB- or ALP-, meaning 'mountain,' so that Albula would mean
the mountain stream (for a small stream of the same name in Picenum,
see <bibl>RE ii. 1331</bibl>). Vergil (ib. viii. 64) calls it caeruleus, a colour which
it not infrequently acquires when the blue sky is reflected in it; but its
general and more approproate epithet is flavus (ib. vii. 31; Hor. <bibl>Carm.
i. 2</bibl>. 13; <bibl>ii. 3</bibl>. 18).</p>
<p>It is a turbulent river and much subject to floods, which have always
been a source of great danger to the city. No less than 132 inundations
have been recorded (<bibl>BC 1895, 283-300</bibl>, for the mediaeval and Renaissance
periods). Julius Caesar had a scheme for cutting a new channel a Ponte
Mulvio secundum  montes Vaticanos; see <ref target="campus-vaticanus" n="U">CAMPUS VATICANUS</ref> (Cic.
ad <bibl>Att. xiii. 33</bibl>. 4; HJ 493-494).</p>
<p>The cura Tiberis under the republic was in the hands of the censors.
Protecting walls were built at least as early as the <dateRange from="-199" to="-100">second century B.C.</dateRange>
(see <ref target="cloaca-maxima" n="U">CLOACA MAXIMA</ref>, and cf. <bibl>BC 1889, 165-172</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 285</bibl>), and

CIL i². 766, a-t). They extend from the Pons Mulvius, at the second
mile of the via Flaminia, downstream as far as the Almo on the left
bank, while one was seen in the <dateRange from="1600" to="1699">seventeenth century</dateRange> near S. Passera
(opposite S. Paolo) on the right bank. On the other hand, it was the
praetor urbanus who, a little earlier (the inscriptions are attributed to
the time of Sulla), traced the boundary line between public and private
property at Ostia (<bibl>NS 1910, 554</bibl>; <bibl>YW  1911, 12</bibl>; <bibl>1920, 89</bibl>; Calza

<p>The next termination was carried out by the consuls of <date value="-8">8 B.C.</date>,
C. Asinius Gallus and C. Marcius Censorinus, and twenty of these cippi
remain (<bibl>CIL vi. 31541</bibl>, a-u), and a third by Augustus himself in the
following year, twenty-two cippi remaining (ib. 31542, a-w). In this
termination the distance in a straight line r(ecta) r(egione) to the next
cippus is given in feet, on the front, back or side (cf. CIL cit. p. 3110;
see <ref target="ripa-veientana" n="U">RIPA VEIENTANA</ref>).</p>
<p>In <date value="15">15 A.D.</date> a great inundation occurred, and the cura riparum was
instituted by Tiberius (Tac. <bibl>Ann. i. 76</bibl>; Cass. <bibl>Dio lvii. 4</bibl> ; Suet. Aug. 37
is mistaken; cf. Mommsen, RGDA2 29; <bibl>BC 1894, 254-6</bibl>; CIL p. 3109).
The curatores, who were five in number, replaced several of the
earlier cippi by new ones, adding to the original inscription the words
<foreign xml:lang="la">curatores riparum qui primi fuerunt ex senatus consulto restituerunt</foreign>.
Their authority extended as far as Ostia, where one of their cippi and
one of <dateRange from="24" to="37">24-37 A.D.</dateRange> have been found (<bibl>NS 1921, 258-262</bibl>; cf. CIL xiv.
<pb n="538"/>
192; YW  1922-3, 106). A little later on other curatores restored a part
of the bank near the pons Cestius (<bibl>CIL vi. 31543</bibl>), and set up other cippi,
three of which remain (31544 a-c -- before <date value="24">24 A.D.</date>).  From  the reign
of Claudius we have a cippus of the curatores who '<foreign xml:lang="la">ripam cippis positis

Vespasian and afterwards only a single curator is named, it being doubtful
whether one functioned for the whole collegium, or whether henceforth
there was only a single curator (31546-8 -- <dateRange from="73" to="74">73-74 A.D.</dateRange>). We have other
cippi under Trajan (31549-51 -- <date value="101">101</date> and <date value="104">104 A.D.</date> -- seventeen set up by
<foreign xml:lang="la">Ti. Julius Ferox curator alvei Tiberis ... ct cloacarum urbis</foreign>), Hadrian

Flacc. 66:<foreign xml:lang="la"> hoc nimirum est illud quod non longe a gradibus Aurelii

built by M. Aurelius Cotta, consul in that year (74), and as they were
occupied by those in attendance upon the jury trials, gradus and tribunal
probably belonged  together.  Either the terms were used without
distinction, or the gradus led up to the tribunal. These tribunalia were
usually temporary structures of wood (cf. Plut. Caes. 68; Suet. Caes.
84; App. <bibl>BC ii. 148</bibl>): this one, or at least the gradus, was certainly of
stone. There is no indication of its site, and since it is not mentioned

carried out by Caesar and Augustus (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>, 405; Thedenat, 148;

monetalis in <date value="-23">23 B.C.</date> (BM. Aug. 139-146; cf. p. xcv), and the inscriptions
seem to indicate that he constructed a praetor's tribunal at this point in
the forum, as well as repairing it (see <ref target="forum-romanum" n="U">FORUM ROMANUM</ref>, p. 234, n. I;
ZA 86; DR 73, 74; RE <bibl>Suppl. iv. 504</bibl>; HFP 27, 28), in connection
with Augustus' rebuilding of the rostra. It is possible that this was the
usual place for the praetor's seat after it had been moved from the
comitium (cf. another praetor's inscription, <bibl>CIL vi. 1278</bibl>, found here in
1817). The structure of Naevius was not monumental, but the traditional
wooden platform may have been provided with a stone foundation, or an

Richter) has not been fully appreciated, and we must refer to it a general
repairing of the whole Forum (<bibl>JRS 1926, 134</bibl>).</p>

it is probable, although not certain, that they stood there originally
(for a theory that they stood at first in the forum sub novis, based on
Cic. de orat. ii. 266; Plin. <bibl>NH xxxv. 25</bibl>; <bibl>Quint. vi. 3</bibl>. 38, see <bibl>Mel. 1908,

confused with the so-called Trofei di Mario, the marble statues now
standing on the balustrade of the Piazza del Campidoglio which were
brought here in 1590 from  the <ref target="nymphaeum-1" n="U">NYMPHAEUM</ref>  (q.v.) in the Piazza di

<p>Besides these tropaea of the Capitol, there was another set in Rome,

<p> the name given by Bianchini in 1703 to the
remains of. a structure discovered in that year under the Casa della
Missione, just north-west of the Piazza di Monte Citorio. This building,
with an orientation like that of the columns of Antoninus and Marcus
Aurelius, consisted of three square enclosures, one within another. The
two inner enclosure walls were of travertine; the outer consisted of a
travertine kerb, on which stood pillars of the same material with an iron
grating between them. The innermost enclosure was 13 metres square,
the second 23, and the outer 30 metres square. A free space, 3 metres
wide, was left between the first and second walls and between the second
and third. The entrance was on the south.</p>
<p>According to the usual view, this was the funeral pyre on which the
bodies of the Antonines were burned. It is also possible that it may
have been a great altar, attached to the column of Antoninus, on which
sacrifices were offered at the deification of the emperors (for Bianchini's
description, still in MS., see <bibl>Mitt. 1889, 48-64</bibl>). Lanciani suggests
(<bibl>RL xiii. 1908</bibl>, 92) that this may have been the ustrinum Antonini Pii
et Faustinae, while another similar structure, of which the ruins were
found in 1907 just a little to the north-east of the first, was the ustrinum
M. Aurelii Antonini (<bibl>NS 1907, 525-528</bibl>, 68 ; <bibl>1909, 10-11</bibl>; <bibl>1915, 322</bibl>;

<placeName>USTRINUM DOMUS AUGUSTAE</placeName>

<p> the name in current use for the Kaorrpa,
or crematory, belonging to the mausoleum  of AUGUSTUS (q.v.) in the
campus Martius, and described by Strabo (v. 3. 9, p. 236) as an enclosure
of travertine with a metal grating, presumably on top of the wall, and
planted inside with black poplars. Excavations in 1777 at the corner
of the Corso and Via degli Otto Cantoni brought to light six large
rectangular cippi of travertine, with inscriptions of various members of
the domus Augusta, the three sons of Germanicus, his daughter, Tiberius
the son of Drusus, and a certain Vespasianus (<bibl>CIL vi. 888-893</bibl>) and a
fine alabaster urn (HF 213). It is very probable that these cippi,
or at any rate the first three, which all end with the formula '<foreign xml:lang="la"> hic crematus
est,</foreign>' belonged to the ustrinum, and that this lay on the east side of the
mausoleum (HJ 620) ; while the fourth and fifth, which bear the formula<foreign xml:lang="la">hic situs (or sita) est</foreign>, may have belonged to the mausoleum. Hirschfeld,
however, excludes this possibility, mainly because of the material and
form  of the cippi (Berl. Sitz. <bibl>Ber. 1886, 1155-1156</bibl>=Kleine Schriften,

<p>It is probable that the adjective form, Vaticanus, is derived from
some substantive, perhaps Vaticanum (Elter, see below), or from the early
Etruscan name of some settlement, like Vatica or Vaticum (Niebuhr), of
which all other traces have vanished, except possibly the cognomen
Vaticanus which is found twice in the consular Fasti in <date value="-455">455</date> and <date value="-451">451 B.C.</date>

ture, of the long ridge from the Janiculum to the modern Monte Mario
(Cic. ad <bibl>Att. xiii. 33</bibl>. 4:<foreign xml:lang="la"> a ponte Milvio Tiberim duci sccundum montes
Vaticanos, campum  Martium	coacdificari, illum  autem  campus  Vaticanum  fieri quasi Martium	campum</foreign>). Here campus Vaticanus must

<p>
<placeName>(3) VATICANUS MONS</placeName></p>
<p> in the singular could be used of any one of the

(<bibl>Carm. i. 20</bibl>. 7:<foreign xml:lang="la"> redderet laudes tibi Vaticani montis imago</foreign>, cf. Porphyr.
et Acron ad loc.), where it means the Janiculum, and in Juvenal (6. 344:<foreign xml:lang="la">et Vaticano fragiles de monte patellas</foreign>), where it is more general, as the
clay pits are scattered all along this ridge. Festus' Vaticanus collis
(379:<foreign xml:lang="la"> Vaticanus collis appellatus est quod eo potitus sit populus Romanus
vatum responso expulsis Etruscis</foreign>) is to be explained as a mere variant
of mons, introduced simply for the sake of the etymology. There is
no evidence that Vaticanus mons was a specific name for any one part
of the ridge during the classical period. It was in consequence of the
gradual restriction of Vaticanum (see below) to the area occupied by the
<ref target="circus-gai-et-neronis" n="U">CIRCUS GAI ET NERONIS</ref> (q.v.), and the identification of this site as the
burial place of S. Peter, that Vaticanus mons became localised in its
mediaeval and modern sense (Prud. c. <bibl>Symm. i. 583</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> qui... Vaticano

<placeName>(5) VATICANUM</placeName></p>
<p> the substantive, either an original place name or
the neuter of the adjective (see above), which was used first to designate,
in whole or in part, the level district between the Janiculum-Monte
Mario ridge and the Tiber, being more or less equivalent to Cicero's
campus Vaticanus, and extending south, probably to the city limits
proper (Plin. <bibl>NH xviii. 20</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">aranti quattuor sua iugera in Vaticano

<bibl>Hist. ii. 93</bibl>: <foreign xml:lang="la">infamibus Vaticani locis magna pars tetendit</foreign>); thrice
tombs are mentioned that probably stood along the line of the modern
Borghi (Hist. Aug. Ver. 6. 4; Elag. 23. I; Acro ad Hor. Ep. 9. 25:<foreign xml:lang="la"> tunc
levati cineres eius sunt de pyramide in Vaticano constituta)</foreign>; and it
contained a recognised pauper element in its population (Amm. <bibl>Marcell.

<p>With the building of the circus Gai et Neronis, which was also called
<pb n="548"/>
circus Vaticanus (Plin. NI-I xvi. 201; <bibl>xxxvi. 74</bibl>), increased importance
was given to this particular area, and Vaticanum then came to be used
of the circus itself, as well as of the whole district (Suet. Claud. 21. 2:
circenses frequenter etiam in Vaticano commisit; Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvii. 4</bibl>.
16: <foreign xml:lang="la">quorum unus (obeliscus) in Vaticano</foreign>; Not. Reg. XIV, cf. however,
Pr. Reg. 207).</p>
<p>Another application of the name Vaticanum seems to have been to
the shrine of the Magna Mater, whose cult was established close to the
circus (cf. <ref target="frigianum" n="U">FRIGIANUM</ref>), if we may judge from an inscription found at
Lyon (<bibl>CIL xiii. 1751</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> L. Aemilius Carpus vires excepit et a Vaticano

emendations, and therefore the existence of the temple, near that of
Aesculapius, are accepted by most scholars (cf. HJ 635: WR 236;

<placeName>VELABRUM</placeName>

<p> the low ground lying between the north-west slope of the
Palatine and the Capitoline. The name is probably ancient, and originally
it may well have been given to the whole district between these two hills,
the forum valley and the river, but during the historical period it was
somewhat more restricted. It was bounded approximately by the
forum on the north, the slope of the Palatine and the vicus Tuscus on
the east, the district traversed by the vicus Iugarius on the west, while
the line of separation between it and the forum Boarium passed through
the present church of S. Giorgio in Velabro and is marked by the arcus
argentariorum (<bibl>CIL vi. 1035</bibl>; cf. Varro, <bibl>LL v. 43</bibl>; <bibl>vi. 24</bibl>; <bibl>Liv. xxvii.
37</bibl>. 15; Plut. Rom. 5). According to tradition, which there seems to be
no good reason to doubt, this district was originally very swampy, with
sufficient water to float small boats (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 44</bibl>; Plut. Rom. 5;
Ovid. <bibl>Fast. vi. 405</bibl>; <bibl>Prop. iv. 9</bibl>. 5; <bibl>Tib. ii. 5</bibl>. 33), until it was drained by
the construction of the cloaca Maxima and the connecting system of
sewers. It was always, however, subject to inundation when the Tiber
was very high.
The meaning and etymology of Velabrum  are uncertain. Varro
(<bibl>LL. v. 44</bibl>, 156) derived it a vehendo (i.e. ratibus), and Plutarch (Rom. 5)
also suggests a derivation from the vela carried in processions, but
<pb n="550"/>
neither these nor those of modern scholars are satisfactory (cf. Jord. i. I.
195; <bibl>Gilb. i. 103</bibl>; Nissen, Templum, 84).</p>
<p>The Velabrum was an important centre of industrial and commercial
activity, and in particular of the trade in food-stuffs, oil and wine (Plaut.
Capt. 489; Curc. 483; Hor. <bibl>Sat. ii. 3</bibl>. 229; <bibl>Mart. xi. 52</bibl>. 10; <bibl>xiii. 32</bibl>;
<bibl>CIL vi. 467</bibl>, 9184, 9259, 9993, 33933). It was a locus celeberrimus urbis
(<bibl>Macrob. i. 10</bibl>. 15), for all the traffic between the forum and the pons
Sublicius passed through the streets that bounded it, the vicus Tuscus
and the vicus Iugarius (cf. <bibl>Liv. xxvii. 37</bibl>. 15; Suet. Caes. 37, for the
line of the pompa), but it seems to have contained only one shrine, that
of Acca Larentia (Cic. ad <bibl>Brut. i. 15</bibl>. 8). In two passages in poetry (Ovid,
Propertius, locc. citt.) Velabra is used in the plural, and in Varro (LL v.
v. 156:<foreign xml:lang="la"> ab his palus fuit in minore Velabro, . . . ut illud maius de quo supra
dictum est</foreign>) a distinction is made between Velabrum maius and Velabrum
minus, but it is not possible to determine what this is (cf. Pais, Anc.

porticus. This seems to have been a resort of questionable characters (Ov.

inscription contains the only post-Augustan reference to the temple, it is
not unlikely that during the empire it was called the temple of <ref target="venus-hortorum-sallustianorum-aedes" n="U">VENUS

<p> the double temple
on the Velia built by Hadrian (Chron. 146; Hieron. a. Abr. 2147),
and dedicated to Venus Felix, the ancestress of the Roman people, and
to the genius of the city, Roma aeterna. The association of these two
divinities on a coin of C. Egnatius Maximus is noticed by Babelon (i. 472;
but cf. BM. Rep. i. p. 399, n. 3). It was also called templum urbis
<pb n="553"/>
Romae (Serv. <bibl>Aen. ii. 227</bibl>), templum urbis (Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 14;
Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19; Cassiod. Chron.), urbis Venerisque templa (Prud.

The plans were drawn by Hadrian himself, and evoked sharp criticism
from his Greek architect, Apollodorus, who is said to have been put to
death in consequence (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxix. 4</bibl>). The temple was dedicated
in <date value="1135">135 A.D.</date> (Hieron. loc. cit.; cf. <bibl>Athen. viii. 63</bibl>, p. 361, who erroneously
gives the day as the Parilia), but perhaps finished by Antoninus Pius
(Cohen, Hadrian 1420-1423, Pius 698-703, 1074-1076).</p>
<p>In accordance with Roman theory in such matters, it was necessary
to build a separate cella for each goddess, in this case not side by side, but
back to back, that of Venus facing east, and that of Roma west (Prud.
loc. cit.: atque Urbis Venerisque pari se culmine tollunt templa). In
307 the temple was injured by fire and restored by Maxentius (Chron. 148;
Aur. Vict. Caes. 40: urbis fanum) ; and the whole of the superstructure
dates from his time, as was first pointed out by Nibby (Roma <bibl>Antica
ii. 738</bibl>; <note anchored="true" place="foot"> ASA vii. should be corrected.
</note> cf. <bibl>AJA  1912, 429</bibl>). It was one of the monuments that
aroused the special wonder of Constantius when he visited Rome in 356
(Amm. <bibl>Marcell. xvi. 10</bibl>. 14), and was probably the largest and most magnificent temple in the city. It is mentioned in the Notitia (Reg. IV), and
somewhat later by Prudentius (loc. cit.), for the last time in antiquity.
The history of its destruction is unknown, but in 847-853 Leo IV built
the church of S. Maria Nova in its ruins (HCh 352), and this is one of the
chief arguments that it was the earthquake of his reign that wrought so
much harm in and around the forum (<bibl>LPD ii. 108</bibl>, c. 20:<foreign xml:lang="la"> terre motus
in urbe Roma per indictionem factus est x (i.e. before 30th August, 847)
ita ut omnia elementa concussa viderentur ab omnibus</foreign>). This church
was rebuilt in 1612 and is now called S. Francesca Romana. (Cf. p. 235).</p>
<p>The temple proper was built on an enormous podium  of concrete
faced with travertine, 145 metres long and 100 wide, on the north side
of the Sacra via, between the Velia and the Colosseum, and on the line
of the main axis of the latter, necessitating the removal of the <ref target="colossus-neronis" n="U">COLOSSUS
NERONIS</ref> (q.v.). Owing to the slope of the ground, the height of the
podium at the east end is considerable, and chambers were constructed
in it for the storage of the machinery and apparatus of the amphitheatre.
On this podium was a peribolus formed of a colonnade consisting of an
outer wall and a single row of enormous columns of grey Egyptian granite
on the sides, and probably of a double row of columns only at the ends.
This colonnade had projections like propylaea at the corners and at the
middle of the long sides. See <bibl>JRS 1919, 184</bibl>, for Ligorio's plan of it
(the genuineness of which is doubtful). At the west end of the podium a
wide flight of steps led down to the paved area in front of the temple;
but at the east end there were only two small flights. The temple
proper was raised on a platform, seven steps high, in the centre of the
<pb n="554"/>
peribolus. The two cellar ended in apses placed back to back; but a:
the side walls of the cellae were prolonged so as to meet, the external
appearance was that of one long rectangular building.</p>
<p>This temple was decastyle, of the Corinthian order, and pseudo-
dipteral (Cohen, Hadr. 1420-3,<note anchored="true" place="foot"> These coins show an isolated column with a statue (Hadrian and Sabina) on each side
of the temple; and Thiersch maintains (Jahrb. d. <bibl>Inst. 1913, 266-267</bibl>) that the prototype
of this arrangement was the temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, which Hadrian is known to
have visited just before the erection of the temple of Venus and Rome.
</note> Pius 698-703, 1074-6; <bibl>BC 1903, 19</bibl>), the
columns of the peristyle being of white marble about 1.8 metres in
diameter. The cellae were narrower than the facade, and each pronaos
had only four columns between the antae. The building was constructed
of brick-faced  concrete, and  entirely  covered with  marble.  Within
the cellae, on each side, were rows of porphyry columns supporting an
entablature.  In the apses were five niches, alternately square and
semicircular, with columns and entablatures in front of them. In the
central niche of each apse was the statue of the goddess herself-Venus,
in one and Roma in the other. Within the precincts of the temple were
silver statues of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina, and an altar on which
sacrifice was made by newly married couples (Cass. <bibl>Dio lxxi. 31</bibl>), a statue
of Minerva (Serv. <bibl>Aen. ii. 227</bibl>), and doubtless many more (Hist. Aug.
trig. tyr. 32).</p>
<p>A single staircase, between the apses on the south side, led to the
roof of the temple (<bibl>NA  1910, 631-638</bibl>; RA  131-132, 213-215), which
was covered with gilt tiles. A part of the west front of the temple, with
its sculptured pediment, is represented on two fragments of a relief, now
in the Lateran and Museo delle Terme (MD 3519; Benndorf-Schoene,
Lateran 20; S. Sculp. 238-240; <bibl>Mitt. 1895, 248</bibl>; PT 227-228; see

figure of the Dca Roma in the relief of the Haterii may be an allusion to this temple (see
<ref target="arcus-titi-2" n="U">ARCUS TITI</ref>). For Gorgoneia which may belong to its decoration, see 11F ii, 14, 30.
</note> which shows that on this west pediment were reliefs of Mars
visiting Rhea Silvia and of the she-wolf suckling the twins. Most of
the west cella has been destroyed; the apse and part of the east cella
still stand in ruins, with many fragments of the columns of peristyle
and peribolus (see DAP 2. xv. 368, and LS i. passim; <bibl>ii. 220-222</bibl>, for
particulars of building materials quarried on its site). This temple with
its enormous peribolus falls into the same category of buildings as the
imperial fora, of which it formed a virtual continuation (HJ 17-20; <bibl>Gilb.

<p>The temple was prostyle hexastyle, 33 metres long and 22 wide,

marble, 15.20 metres high and 1.57 in diameter at the base, and support
a portion of the entablature on which are the last letters of the inscription.
Columns and entablature were reset in 1811, at which time it was still
called the temple of Jupiter Tonans. A restored fragment of the cornice

<p>* the temple of Vesta at the east end of the forum, near

<bibl>Mart. i. 70</bibl>. 3-4; Hor. <bibl>Sat. i. 9</bibl>), originally within the precinct of the
Vestals (<ref target="atrium-vestae" n="U">ATRIUM VESTAE</ref>, q.v.; Van Deman, Atrium  Vestae, 9-11).
The building of this shrine was ascribed by some to Romulus, but wrongly
according to the Roman antiquarians, who attributed it to Numa (<bibl>Dionys.
ii. 65-66</bibl>; Fest. 262; Plut. Numa ii).  It was, however, outside the
Palatine pomerium, and cannot have antedated the second stage of the
city's growth. It was a round, tholus-shaped, structure (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi.
265-282</bibl>; Fest. Plut. locc. citt.), probably in imitation of the ancient
Italic hut (Altm. 14), and said to have been built originally of wattles
with a thatched roof (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 261-262</bibl>). It was not an inaugurated
templum (<bibl>Gell. xiv. 7</bibl>. 7; Serv. <bibl>Aen. vii. 153</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> non augurio consecratum
ne illuc conveniret senatus</foreign>), although it was sometimes called templum
by the poets (e.g. Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 265</bibl>, 281). It contained the sacred fire
(Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 297</bibl>; see <ref target="porta-stercoraria" n="U">PORTA STERCORARIA</ref>), the Palladium brought
by Aeneas from Troy (Ov. Trist. iii. I. 29; <bibl>Dionys. ii. 66</bibl>), and other
sacra (Dionys. loc. cit.), which were kept in a secret recess called the penus
Vestae (Fest. 250: <foreign xml:lang="la">penus vocatur intumus in aede Vestae tegetibus
Saeptus</foreign>; Serv. <bibl>Aen. iii. 12</bibl>; cf. Fest. 158, 161; Altm. 59-60), but no
statue of the goddess herself (Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 295-298</bibl>; see <ref target="vesta-aedicula-ara" n="U">AEDICULA
VESTAE, S. ATRIUM VESTAE</ref>, ad fin.).</p>
<p>This temple was undoubtedly burned when the Gauls sacked the city
in <date value="-390">390 B.C.</date> (<bibl>Liv. v. 42</bibl>; Plut. Cam. 21), and again in <date value="-241">241</date> when Caecilius
Metellus rescued the Palladium at the cost of his sight, which was miraculously restored (Liv. ep. 19; Oros. iv. ii. 9; Ov. <bibl>Fast. vi. 437-454</bibl>;
<bibl>Dionys. ii. 66</bibl>; Plin. <bibl>NH vii. 141</bibl>; Val. <bibl>Max. i. 4</bibl>. 5). In 210 it was saved
from burning by the devotion of thirteen slaves (<bibl>Liv. xxvi. 27</bibl>), and again
<pb n="558"/>
in 14 it was threatened and the sacra removed (Cass. <bibl>Dio liv. 24</bibl>). In the
great fire of <date value="64">64 A.D.</date> it was burned, but soon restored, probably by Nero
(Tac. <bibl>Ann. xv. 41</bibl>; <bibl>Hist. i. 43</bibl>; cf. Cohen, Nero, n. 334, 335; BM.
Nero ioi-io6; cf. Introd. clxxv), and later in 191 (<bibl>Herod. i. 14</bibl>. 4: Cass.
<bibl>Dio lxxii. 24</bibl>), when it was restored by Julia Domna, the wife of Septimius
Severus. It is mentioned in the Regionary Catalogue (Reg. VIII), and
was closed by Theodosius in 394.</p>
<p>This temple is represented on coins dating from the end of the republic

<p>The excavations of 1883 and <dateRange from="1899" to="1900">1899-1900</dateRange> brought to light various
architectural fragments and the podium  (<bibl>NS 1883, 434-468</bibl>;  <bibl>1900,
159-191</bibl>; NA  <bibl>Aug. 1900, 437-456</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1900, 281-284</bibl>; <bibl>1903, 57-69</bibl>;

of concrete with facings of opus incertum and brick. The lowest stratum
is a circular foundation set in the soil, 15.05 metres in diameter and
2.17 thick. On this rest the three others. On the east side and here
and there on the other sides of these strata are tufa blocks which were
the foundation of the marble steps. Almost in the centre of this podium
is a cavity of trapezoidal shape, extending to the bottom of the foundation, a depth of 5 metres. The sides measure between 2.30 and 2.50
metres in length. This cavity, or favissa, was entered from the floor of
the cella, and may have been the receptacle of the stercus (Fest. 344;
<bibl>AA 1899, 3</bibl>) or ashes of the sacred fire which were removed once a year
and emptied out of the porta Stercoraria. Most of this foundation and
podium  dates from Augustus (<bibl>AJA 1912, 393</bibl>), but the favissa belongs
to the early part of the principate of Domitian (ib. 413), and the highest
stratum to the time of Septimius Severus (ib. 426).</p>
<p>The coins of Augustus (Cohen, Aug. 250-25 ), probably struck towards
the end of Tiberius' reign (BM. Tib. 142; cf. Introd. cxxxii, cxxxix;
Num. <bibl>Chron. 1917, 258</bibl>, for dating), represent a round structure with a
conical roof (of bronze, according to Pliny <bibl>NH xxxiv. 13</bibl>), standing on a
base of three steps, with columns surmounted by Ionic capitals as is also
<pb n="559"/>
the case on the Florence relief.  The existing architectural fragments
belong to the final restoration by Julia Domna, and these, together with
the coins and reliefs, enable us to restore the temple with some degree
of accuracy. The change from  Ionic to Corinthian capitals seems to
have been made during the <dateRange from="100" to="199">first century</dateRange>, probably by the Flavians, but
it is not probable that the temple of the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century</dateRange> differed materially
from that of the first except in this respect and in the greater height of
the podium. It was of white marble, peripteral, with twenty columns
connected by metal gratings. The roof was dome-shaped, with an
opening in the centre for the exit of smoke of the sacred fire. This
opening must have been protected by metal work of some kind, which
would allow the entrance of light. There are indications of at least
one window in the cella wall. The shafts of the columns were fluted,
0.51 metre in diameter and about 4.45 in height. The door was on a
level with the top of the podium, and not approached by steps as on the
coins of Augustus.</p>

<p>the road leading to Ardea, 24 miles distant, which (according to the view

wall (on the left of it is a large circular tomb-HJ 186; LF 45) as far
as the postern generally known as <ref target="porta-ardeatina" n="U">PORTA ARDEATINA</ref>, which was removed
when the great bastion was built for Paul III by Antonio da Sangallo
the younger (<bibl>Mitt. 1894, 320-327</bibl>). Nothing is left of the course of the
road just outside the gate. No milestones belonging to it have been
found, but an inscription (<bibl>CIL vi. 8469</bibl>) records a manceps viarum
Laurentinae et Ardeatinae.</p>
<p>From this it has been concluded that these two roads diverged just
outside the porta Ardeatina (Mon. <bibl>L. xiii. 137-142</bibl>); but it has also
been pointed out that the road which branches from the <ref target="via-ostiensis" n="U">VIA OSTIENSIS</ref>
(q.v.) at vicus Alexandri must be the via Laurentina mentioned by
Pliny (<bibl>Ep. ii. 17</bibl>. 2:<foreign xml:lang="la"> et Laurentina et Ostiensis eodem ferunt</foreign>); and it
is very likely that one was the vetus and the other the nova (EE ix. p. 375,
376), and probably the first mentioned would be the vetus.</p>
<p>Another solution is to suppose that the via Ardeatina diverged from the
via Appia to the right at the church of Domine quo vadis (?), as the modern
road which bears the name via Ardeatina does. In that case the road
which ran through the porta Naevia and the postern just mentioned
would be the via Laurentina (vetus ?). This avoids the necessity of
supposing the existence (which, if we accept the usual theory, we must
do) of three bridges <note anchored="true" place="foot"> This is, of course, excluding the bridge of the via Ostiensis; and it is worth noting
that the Tabula Peutingerana only marks three bridges in all, inclusive of it.

<p>* (Not. app.):</p>
<p> the road which ran along the north side of
the circus Gai, diverging from the via Triumphalis a little to the west of
the pons Neronianus, near a large tomb (the so-called <ref target="meta-romuli" n="U">META ROMULI</ref>, q.v.;
cf. Mon. <bibl>L. i. 525-527</bibl>; LR 560; DAP 2. viii. 383). Various tombs
orientated on its axis were found in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries in the rebuilding of S. Peter's, and on it was situated the tomb
of the Apostle himself (Lanciani, Pagan and Christian Rome 126-131;
HJ 658-660). After the construction of the pons Aelius it was prolonged
eastward to communicate with it (see PORTA CORNELIA). It left the
Leonine wall by the porta Pertusa (KH iii.; LF 13), and ran westward
for some 9 miles. Thus far it is clearly traceable; but whether it turned
northwards to Boccea or what course it followed after that is quite
uncertain. It was under the curatores of the <ref target="via-aurelia" n="U">VIA AURELIA</ref> (<bibl>Mel. 1902, 1-7</bibl>;

the censorship of C. Flaminius (Liv. Epit. xx.; <bibl>Strabo v. 217</bibl> wrongly

importance led to its having a special curator as early as <date value="-65">65 B.C.</date> (Cic.

(<bibl>Strabo v. 227</bibl>; Tac. <bibl>Hist. i. 86</bibl>; <bibl>ii. 64</bibl>), and the four silver cups of about
the time of Trajan, found at Vicarello, on which is the itinerary by land
from  Rome to Gades, prove this (<bibl>CIL xi. 3281-3284</bibl>).  Cf. Hist. Aug.
Maximin. 25. 2.</p>
<p>The road gave its name to one of the districts of Italy as early as the
<dateRange from="100" to="199">second century A.D.</dateRange> We have epigraphic testimony of the importance
of the traffic on it (<foreign xml:lang="la">praef. vehiculorum a copis Aug. per viam Flaminiam

<p>The via Flaminia started in a north-north-west direction from  a
gate of the Servian wall on the east slope of the Capitol which had wrongly
been identified with the <ref target="porta-ratumenna" n="U">PORTA RATUMENA</ref>, though later topographers
identify it with the <ref target="porta-fontinalis" n="U">PORTA FONTINALIS</ref> (<bibl>RhM  1894, 411</bibl>). It turned
slightly westward a little before passing the tomb of <ref target="sep-bibuli" n="U">BIBULUS</ref> (q.v.),
and passing the so-called tomb of the Claudii, resumed its former direction.
<pb n="563"/>
It then ran across the campus Martius, forming the boundary between the
seventh and ninth regions of Augustus, and on in an absolutely straight
line to the pons Mulvius, a distance of about 3 miles. Burial on it
was regarded as a special honour; cf. Stat. Silv. ii. I. 176; <bibl>Mart. vi. 28</bibl>,
29; <bibl>viii. 75</bibl>. 1, 2 (see <ref target="via-tecta-1" n="U">VIA TECTA</ref>); <bibl>xi. 13</bibl>; <bibl>Iuv. i. 170</bibl>; see HJ 462-464,
471, 484, 491-492, 621. The part within the Aurelian walls was known
as the via Lata from  the <dateRange from="300" to="399">fourth century A.D.</dateRange> onwards. The modern
Corso coincides absolutely with the ancient line, and the two churches
which flank it where it ends in the Piazza del Popolo both stand on
ancient tombs, while many other tombs were sacrificed for the construction of the <ref target="porta-flaminia" n="U">PORTA FLAMINIA</ref>.</p>
<p>The cura of the road was generally held alone (<bibl>CIL ii. 4126</bibl>, 4510

<bibl>BC 1892, 78</bibl>).  Between them, just outside it, is the <ref target="sep-eurysacis" n="U">SEPULCRUM EURYSACIS</ref> (q.v.). The fact that the gate took its name from the latter shows
that the intramural portion of the road, from the porta Esquilina, should
really bear the same name; though Strabo (v. 3. 9. p. 237) speaks of
both roads as starting from the porta Esquilina, which has led to the
impossible theory that they separated just outside the gate, rejoined just
before the porta Tiburtina, and then separated again (Jord. i. I. 358-362;
<bibl>PBS i. 139</bibl> n., 149-150). The first part of the via Labicana may have
belonged to the original route to Tusculum; it ran, as its name implies,
in the first instance, to Labici, 15 miles from Rome, and then joined the 
<pb n="564"/>
via Latina by crossroads at three different points. In later days, however, it very likely superseded the latter as a road for through traffic, and
its summit level is 650 feet lower, and the difference in length at Ad
Bivium is less than a mile. The milestones in the further portion of its
course will therefore agree with either numeration (contrast CIL x. p. 695).
Administratively it seems to have been under the same curator as the
via Latina (<bibl>BC 1891, 112-121</bibl>). For its first milestone (Vespasian), see
<bibl>BC 1903, 371</bibl>; <bibl>NS 1903, 513</bibl>; <bibl>Mitt. 1903, 336</bibl>; and for others, <bibl>CIL

<p> a road which branched off to the left from the via Appia
830 metres from the porta Capena, and after 500 metres more passed
through the <ref target="porta-latina" n="U">PORTA LATINA</ref> of the Aurelian wall. The whole triangle
between the two roads was occupied by tombs (<bibl>T. ii. 19</bibl>; LR 321-337;

road (<bibl>Iuv. i. 170</bibl>:<foreign xml:lang="la"> experiar quid concedatur in illos quorum Flaminia
tegitur cinis atque Latina</foreign>), which, like the via Appia, ran in a straight
line for the first ii miles. <bibl>Liv. ii. 39</bibl> uses it, in speaking of Coriolanus,
only as a geographical description; for it was not in existence so early.
Its history is unknown, but its straightness of line shows that it was
not a primitive road but an artificial military highway; and it was
probably constructed after the pass of Algidus had been secured in
<date value="-389">389 B.C.</date>; and it must have run at least as early as <date value="-334">334 B.C.</date> as far as Cales
(<bibl>Liv. x. 36</bibl>).</p>
<p>It was joined at three different points by the via Labicana or by
branches. <bibl>Strabo v. 3</bibl>. 9, p. 237, shows that the via Latina was in his
time regarded as the principal road, and indeed he classes it with the
Appia and Valeria as among the most famous; but in later times the
easier line taken by the via Labicana may have commended it to travellers,
though the Latina was kept up also (for a milestone of Maxentius, see
<bibl>PBS i. 278</bibl>). The distance being identical, the milestones will agree
with the numeration along either road (<bibl>PBS iv. 7</bibl>, 8). In any case
the independent existence of both ceased at Casilinum, where they joined
the via Appia.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the <dateRange from="200" to="299">third century A.D.</dateRange> the viae Labicana and

there was a separate official for the via Latina Nova (x. 5398; see <bibl>BC

to fetch salt from the salt marshes at the mouth of the Tiber (Festus
326; Paul. ex Fest. 327; Cic. de nat. deor. iii. 5. II; <bibl>Strabo v. 3</bibl>. I, p. 228,

see <ref target="salinae" n="U">SALINAE</ref>), which may have thus originated even before the foundation
of Rome (see <ref target="vicus-iugarius" n="U">VICUS IUGARIUS</ref>). There was a legend that a treaty with
the Sabines was made by Tullus Hostilius (Hor. Epist. ii. I. 24; <bibl>Dionys.
iii. 33</bibl>). It was also the route to Antemnae and Fidenae (<bibl>Liv. vii. 9</bibl>. 6),
and later on acquired importance as the thoroughfare to Reate and,
through the Apennines, to Amiternum  and Ausculum  (Ascoli Piceno,
not far from the Adriatic coast). We have inscriptions of five of its
curatores (<bibl>CIL vi. 1507</bibl>, 1509; <bibl>viii. 7033</bibl>;<note anchored="true" place="foot"> In this inscription we have <foreign xml:lang="la">curatori via]rum Salariae Fo. ...</foreign> What the second name

(<bibl>CIL xv. 478-532</bibl>, 683), no doubt beyond the bridge over the Anio.</p>
<p>The via Salaria vetus (first mentioned in the Depos. Mart. of 335-336
ap. Chron. p. 71 (M), and then in other lists of catacombs) undoubtedly
diverged to the left from the main via Salaria, and was cut by the Aurelian
wall between the second and third towers west of the gate. A very large
number of tombs have been found along the first part of its course (111. 56).
It can be traced as far as the foot of the Monti Parioli, but no further;
and though it has been supposed, it is more than doubtful whether it
crossed the Tiber (<bibl>JRS 1921, 130</bibl> ; Riv. Arch. Cris. i. <bibl>(1924)</bibl>, 19-41).  It is
<pb n="568"/>
not impossible that the name came from the fact that in 335-336 people
still remembered its having been closed by the construction of the
Aurelian wall. That the original road ran this way is unlikely. See

The pavement of an ancient street leading in this general direction has

<p> a street that led from the forum, between the basilica
Iulia and the temple of Castor, to the porta Carmentalis (<bibl>Liv. xxiv. 27</bibl>. 115;
<bibl>xxvii. 37</bibl>. 14; <bibl>xxxv. 21</bibl>. 6; Fest. 290; Not. Reg. VII; Hemerol. Vail.
ad iv Kal. Aug.). Its name is said to have been derived from an altar
of Iuno Iuga (Fest. 104:<foreign xml:lang="la"> dictus Romae quia ibi fuerat ara Iunonis Iugae
quam  putabant matrimonia iungere</foreign>; HFP 13). It is far less likely
that the name was given to  this street because the makers of
yokes (iuga) had their shops here, or because it connected the forum
and the district of the forum  Holitorium  (Jord. i. I. 515; 2. 468;
Thedenat 175, 225; <bibl>Gilb. i. 257-263</bibl>; <bibl>iii. 416</bibl>, 417).  The present pavement is not ancient (<bibl>NS 1883, 14</bibl>), but preserves the line of the street
after the building of the basilica Iulia. Before the Augustan period it was
a little further towards the south-east (<bibl>CR 1902, 94</bibl>; <bibl>JRS 1922, 17</bibl>).
A purpurarius (or dealer in purple stuffs) 'de vico iugario' is known to us
from a sepulchral inscription (<bibl>NS 1922, 144</bibl>). See also DR 510-512.</p>
<p>The road later known as the vicus Iugarius was the road by which the
roads from the north, north-east and east--(I) the road which preceded
the via Flaminia and the clivus Argentarius; (2) the via Salaria, the
vicus Longus, the clivus Insteius and the Argiletum; (3) the via Tiburtina
and Labicana,<note anchored="true" place="foot">The via Labicana was probably the original route to Tusculum and the north-eastern slopes of the Alban Hills, and was also the first part of the route southward through the valley of the Sacco</note> the Subura and the Argiletum -- all reached the crossing over the Tiber just below the island. It must have kept close to the
southern edge of the Capitol, to avoid the marshy ground between this
hill and the Palatine. It was thus, there is little doubt, a part of the
original trade route which led to the river, perhaps before there was any
settlement on the site of Rome at all. And there is also a strong pro-
bability that it was the salt marshes on the right bank of the Tiber (see
<ref target="via-salaria" n="U">VIA SALARIA</ref>) that were in use in these early days; otherwise, the roads
from the north and north-east, at any rate, would have made for the
west side of the Capitol (porta Carmentalis or Flumentana) and not
for its east side.</p>
<p>Just as the line of the vicus Iugarius belonged originally to the trade
route from the north, north-east and east to the west and north-west,
so that of the road through the valley of the circus Maximus (see <ref target="forum-boarium" n="U">FORUM
BOARIUM</ref>) belonged to the route from the west and north-west to the south and south-east, forming the approach from the Tiber crossing to the
via Castrimoeniensis and the road to Conca, which approached respectively
the central district of the Alban Hills and their south-western slopes,
the latter going on to join the ancient road at the foot of the Volscian
mountains, which led to Terracina or Anxur long before the via Latina,
<pb n="575"/>
and via Appia (both of them artificial military roads, taking a perfectly
straight line) were even contemplated, and formed the other route to
Capua, Naples, and Magna Graecia. See <bibl>PBS i. 215</bibl> sqq.; iv. I sqq.

which was a square building with two stories, of which the lower opened
outward with a row of arches. It was also decorated with paintings

PATRICIUS</ref> (q.v.), and from the Quirinal on the north-west by the low
ground now marked by the line of the Via Nazionale. Like the Quirinal
it is a tongue of land about 700 metres long, with a present area of
approximately 24 ha. and a height of 50-57 metres.  Originally its
height was somewhat greater (<bibl>BC 1891, 317</bibl>). This hill derived its
name from the osiers (vimina) that grew there (Varro, <bibl>LL v. 5</bibl> ; Fest.

an apparent exception, see <bibl>Eutrop. i. 7</bibl> (6); <bibl>CP 1907, 463-464</bibl>). It
became part of the City of the Four Regions (cf. <ref target="regiones-quattuordecim" n="U">QUATTUOR REGIONES</ref>),
making with the Quirinal the third, Regio Collina. When the Servian
wall was built, the Viminal seems to have been regarded as reaching

the Aurelian wall between the 'porta Ardeatina' and the porta Appia

<div xml:id="vivarium" type="entry">
<head>
<placeName>VIVARIUM</placeName>

<p> an enclosure in which wild beasts intended for use in the
amphitheatre were kept (cf. <bibl>Gell. ii. 20</bibl>). It is mentioned in one inscription of <date value="241">241 A.D.</date> (<bibl>CIL vi. 130</bibl>), and by Procopius (<bibl>BG i. 22</bibl>, 23). Procopius
states distinctly that it was close to the porta Praenestina, that its
outer walls were low without towers or battlements, and that it opened
directly into the city by a gate. This description indicates a rectangular
enclosure, just outside the porta Praenestina, between the Aurelian wall
where it coincides with the aqua Claudia and the via Labicana (HJ
365-367, 391-392). In the <dateRange from="1100" to="1199">twelfth century</dateRange> and later the castra Praetoria
was called Vivarium, and a building just south of it the Vivariolum
(Vivaiolo). This fact, together with some evidence supposed to be
derived from the alleged place of discovery of the inscription, has been
regarded by some as proof that the Vivarium was this building south of
<pb n="583"/>
the Castra (<bibl>BC 1876, 188</bibl>; <bibl>1877, 93</bibl>; <bibl>LS ii. 247-249</bibl>; Richter 298;

testimony of Procopius.</p>

<div xml:id="volcanal" type="entry">
<head>
<placeName>VOLCANAL</placeName>
</head> 
<p>the cult-centre of Vulcan at the foot of the Capitoline at the
north-west corner of the forum, consisting of an uncovered altar of the
god, ascribed by tradition to Titus Tatius (<bibl>Dionys. ii. 50</bibl>. 3; <bibl>Varro
v. 74</bibl>; cf. Fest. 238), and the space, probably enclosed, immediately
around it. The term area Volcani, which was in common use, may have
been synonymous with Volcanal, or perhaps have included some adjacent
ground (<bibl>Liv. ix. 46</bibl>. 6; <bibl>xxxix. 46</bibl>; <bibl>xl. 19</bibl>. 2; <bibl>Gell. iv. 5</bibl>. 4; Fest. 238;
see <ref target="graecostasis" n="U">GRAECOSTASIS</ref>). This area, probably always a locus substructus, was
about 5 metres higher than the comitium  (<bibl>Gell. iv. 5</bibl>. 4; <bibl>Dionys. ii.
50</bibl>. 2; Fest. 290), and from it the kings and magistrates of the early
republic, before the rostra was built, addressed the people (<bibl>Dionys. ii.
50</bibl>. 2; <bibl>vi. 67</bibl>. 2; <bibl>xi. 39</bibl>. 1 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">(*hfai/stou i(ero/n</foreign>) ; <bibl>vii. 17</bibl>. 2 (<foreign xml:lang="greek">to\ (*hfaistei=on</foreign>) ).
On the Volcanal was a statue of Horatius Codes, that had been moved
from the comitium, a locus inferior (<bibl>Gell. iv. 5</bibl>. 4; Auct. de vir. ill. I I. 2 ;
Plut. Popl. 16); a bronze quadriga dedicated to Vulcan, and a statue
of Romulus with a tablet containing a list of his exploits in Greek letters,
both said to have been erected by Romulus (<bibl>Dionys. ii. 54</bibl>. 2); and in
Pliny's time a lotos tree, still growing and said to be as old as the city
(<bibl>NH xvi. 236</bibl>). The Volcanal is mentioned twice in connection with the
prodigium of a shower of blood (<bibl>Liv. xxxix. 46</bibl>; <bibl>xl. 19</bibl>. 2). On 23rd
August, the Volcanalia sacrifice was offered here to Vulcan (Fast. Arv.
ad Kal. Aug., CIL p. i'. 215), as is indicated by the entry in Fast. Ant. ap.
NS 1921, IO9, under this date M[aiae s]upr(a) comi(tium); cf. <bibl>Gilb. i.
248-257</bibl> for the worship of Maia here; and we are told that live fish were
also brought to the area Volcani to be offered up to the god (Fest. 238).</p>
<p>A pedestal dedicated to Vulcan by Augustus in<date value="-9"> 9 B.C.</date> has been found
near S. Adriano (<bibl>CIL vi. 457</bibl>), showing that the cult lasted at least down
to the early empire, although the Volcanal must have been diminished in
size by the encroachment of surrounding buildings, and perhaps entirely
covered at last (<bibl>Jord. i. 2</bibl>. 339-341; Gilb. loc. cit.; <bibl>Mitt. 1893, 87-88</bibl>).
Just behind the arch of Severus some early tufa foundations have been
found which probably belonged to the Volcanal, and traces of a sort
of rock platform, 3.95 metres long by 2.80 wide, which had been covered
with cement and painted red. Its upper surface is cut by various
channels, and in front of it are the remains of a drain made of tufa slabs.
This may possibly have been the ara itself. It shows signs of having been
damaged and repaired. In the surface of this rock are cuttings, round
and square, which have some resemblance to graves and are so regarded
by some writers, e.g. Richter, <bibl>BRT iv. 15-16</bibl>, and Von Duhn (Italische
<bibl>Graberkunde i. 413</bibl> sqq.); the latter, in connection with the discoveries of
early cremation tombs in the forum, which he discusses fully, maintains
that the Volcanal was in the earliest days set aside as an area in which
<pb n="584"/>
corpses were burnt. The tombs themselves he assigns to the Palatine,
and makes the earliest of them contemporary with the later tombs of the
Alban Hills. See <bibl>CR 1902, 94</bibl>; <bibl>BC 1902, 25-26</bibl>, 125-133; <bibl>1903, 159-162</bibl>;

<p>a temple in the campus Martius, built before <date value="-214">214 B.C.</date>

xxiv. 10</bibl>. 9: <foreign xml:lang="la">aedem in campo Volcani</foreign>; <bibl>xxxi. 29</bibl>. 1). Tradition ascribed
it to Romulus himself (Plut. Rom. 27; q. Rom. 47). It was outside
the walls of the city (<bibl>Vitr. i. 7</bibl>. I :<foreign xml:lang="la"> (ut) Volcani vi e moenibus religionibus
et sacrificiis evocata ab timore incendiorum aedificia videantur liberari</foreign>;
Plut. q. Rom. 47). Near it Verres had erected gilded equestrian statues
presented to him by the aratores of Sicily (Cic. in <bibl>Verr. ii. 150</bibl>, 167).
On 23rd August, the Volcanalia, sacrifice was offered to Vulcan (see
<ref target="volcanal" n="U">VOLCANAL</ref>). The calendars differ, however, the Fasti Vallenses (ad Kal.
Sept., CIL ia. p. 240) reading Volcano in circo Flaminio, while the Arvales
(CIL i. p. 215; cf. vi. 32482) contain no indication of place unless Volcano
is to be united with the following Nymphis in campo. (Nor is there any
indication of place in Fast. Ant. ap. <bibl>NS 1921, 109</bibl>.) If this is so, it would
suggest a possible site at the north end of the Saepta (for the discussion
of this question, see CIL iP. p. 326-327; EE i. p. 230; Neue Heidelberger
Jahrbiicher, 1899, 116-117; HJ 481-483; cf. <bibl>BC 1914, 176</bibl> sqq.). This
site, however, is far from the circus Flaminius and makes it necessary to
assume an error in the Fasti Vallenses. For a discussion of the origin
of the cult of Vulcan and his identification with other deities, see Carcopino, Virgile et les Origines d'Ostie 87-167.</p>

deity of Volsinii, and Fulvius celebrated a triumph over the Volsinians
in <date value="-264">264 B.C.</date> (CIL i.a p. 172), it is probable that the temple was built by him
at that time for the god who had been brought to Rome (<bibl>Prop. iv. 2</bibl>. 3;
