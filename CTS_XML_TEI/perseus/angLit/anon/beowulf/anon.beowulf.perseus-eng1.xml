     <l>LO! we of the Spear-Danes', in days of yore,</l>
     <l>Warrior-kings' glory have heard,</l>
     <l>How the princes heroic deeds wrought.</l>
     <l>Oft Scyld, son of Scef, from hosts of foes,</l>
     <l n="5">From many tribes, their mead-seats took;</l>
     <l>The earl caused terror since first he was</l>
     <l>Found thus forlorn: gained he comfort for that,</l>
     <l>Grew under the clouds, in honors throve,</l>
     <l>Until each one of those dwelling around</l>
     <l n="10">Over the whale-road, him should obey,</l>
     <l>Should tribute pay: that was a good king!</l>
     <l>To him was a son afterwards born,</l>
     <l>Young in his palace, one whom God sent</l>
     <l>To the people for comfort: their distress He perceived</l>
     <l n="15">That they ere suffered life-eating care</l>
     <l>So long a while. Him therefor life's Lord,</l>
     <l>King of glory, world-honor gave:</l>
     <l>Beowulf was noted (wide spread his fame),</l>
     <l>The son of Scyld in Scedelands.</l>
     <l n="20">So shall a young man with presents cause,</l>
     <l>With rich money-gifts in his father's house.</l>
     <l>That him in old age may after attend</l>
     <pb n="2"/>
     <l>Willing comrades; when war shall come,</l>
     <l>May stand by their chief; by deeds of praise shall</l>
     <l n="25">In every tribe a hero thrive!</l>
     <l>Then Scyld departed at the hour of fate,</l>
     <l>The warlike to go into his Lord's keeping:</l>
     <l>They him then bore to the ocean's wave,</l>
     <l>His trusty comrades, as he himself bade,</l>
     <l n="30">Whilst with words ruled the friend of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l>Beloved land-prince; long wielded he power.</l>
     <l>There stood at haven with curved prow,</l>
     <l>Shining and ready, the prince's ship:</l>
     <l>The people laid their dear war-lord,</l>
     <l n="35">Giver of rings, on the deck of the ship,</l>
     <l>The mighty by th' mast. Many treasures were there,</l>
     <l>From distant lands, ornaments brought;</l>
     <l>Ne'er heard I of keel more comelily filled</l>
     <l>With warlike weapons and weeds of battle,</l>
     <l n="40">With bills and burnies ! On his bosom lay</l>
     <l>A heap of jewels, which with him should</l>
     <l>Into the flood's keeping afar depart:</l>
     <l>Not at all with less gifts did they him provide,</l>
     <l>With princely treasures, than those had done,</l>
     <l n="45">Who him at his birth had erst sent forth</l>
     <l>Alone o'er the sea when but a child.</l>
     <l>Then placed they yet a golden standard</l>
     <l>High over his head, let the waves bear</l>
     <l>Their gift to the sea; sad was their soul,</l>
     <l n="50">Mourning their mood. Men indeed cannot</l>
     <l>Say now in sooth, hall-possessors,</l>
     <l>Heroes 'neath heavens, who that heap took.</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="53">
     <head>I</head>
     <l>Then was in the cities Beowulf, the Scyldings'</l>
     <l>Beloved folk-king, for a long time</l>
     <l n="55">Renowned 'mid the nation (elsewhere went his father</l>
     <l>The prince from his home), till from him after sprang</l>
     <l>The great Healfdene: he ruled while he lived,</l>
     <pb n="3"/>
     <l>Ag√©d and warlike, kindly the Scyldings.</l>
     <l>To him were four children, reckoned in order,</l>
     <l n="60">Born into the world, to the prince of the people,</l>
     <l>Heorogar and Hrothgar and Halga the good.</l>
     <l>I heard that Elan wife of Ongentheow was,</l>
     <l>The warlike Scylfing's bed-companion.</l>
     <l>Then was to Hrothgar war-speed given,</l>
     <l n="65">Honor in battle, that him his dear kinsmen</l>
     <l>Gladly obeyed, until the youth grew,</l>
     <l>A great band of men. It came into his mind</l>
     <l>That he a great hall would then command,</l>
     <l>A greater mead-hall his men to build</l>
     <l n="70">Than children of men ever had heard of,</l>
     <l>And there within would he all deal out</l>
     <l>To young and to old, as God him gave,</l>
     <l>Except the folk-land and lives of men.</l>
     <l>Then far and wide heard I the work was ordered</l>
     <l n="75">To many a tribe throughout this mid-earth</l>
     <l>The folk-hall to deck. Him in time it befell</l>
     <l>Quickly with men, that it was all ready,</l>
     <l>The greatest of halls: Heort as name gave he it,</l>
     <l>He who with his word power far and wide had.</l>
     <l n="80">He belied not his promise, bracelets he dealt,</l>
     <l>Treasure at banquet. The hall arose</l>
     <l>Lofty and pinnacled; hostile waves it awaited</l>
     <l>Of hateful fire. Nor was it yet long</l>
     <l>Before fierce hatred to the frightened men,</l>
     <l n="85">For deadly enmity, was to arise,</l>
     <l>Since the fell spirit most spitefully</l>
     <l>For a time endured, who in darkness abode,</l>
     <l>That he on each day the sound of joy heard</l>
     <l>Loud in the hall: there was harp's sound,</l>
     <l n="90">Clear song of the minstrel. He said, he who could</l>
     <l>The creation of men from of old relate,</l>
     <l>Quoth that the Almighty the earth had wrought,</l>
     <pb n="4"/>
     <l>The beautiful plain which water surrounds,</l>
     <l>Victorious had set the sun and the moon</l>
     <l n="95">As lights for light to the land-dwellers,</l>
     <l>And had adorned the regions of earth</l>
     <l>With limbs and leaves, life also created</l>
     <l>For every kind of living beings.</l>
     <l>Thus were the warriors living in joys</l>
     <l n="100">Happily then, until one began</l>
     <l>Great woes to work, a fiend of hell:</l>
     <l>The wrathful spirit was Grendel named,</l>
     <l>The mighty mark-stepper who the moors held,</l>
     <l>Fen and fastness: the sea-fiend's abode</l>
     <l n="105">The joyless being a while in-dwelt,</l>
     <l>Since the Creator him had proscribed.</l>
     <l>(Upon Cain's kin that crime avenged</l>
     <l>The Lord eternal, for that he slew Abel:</l>
     <l>Joyed he not in that feud, but him afar banished</l>
     <l n="110">For that crime the Creator away from mankind:</l>
     <l>Thence evil demons all were produced,</l>
     <l>Eotens and elves and monsters of sea,</l>
     <l>Such were the giants who strove against God</l>
     <l>For a long time: He repaid them for that.)</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="115">
     <head>II</head>
     <l n="115">Then went he to seek out, after night came,</l>
     <l>The high-built house, how the Ring-Danes,</l>
     <l>After their beer-feast, it had arranged.</l>
     <l>He found then therein a band of nobles</l>
     <l>Asleep after feasting: sorrows they knew not,</l>
     <l n="120">Misfortunes of men. The demon of death,</l>
     <l>Grim and greedy, soon was ready,</l>
     <l>Fierce and furious, and in rest took</l>
     <l>Thirty of thanes; thence back he departed,</l>
     <l>Exulting in booty, homeward to go,</l>
     <l n="125">With this fill of slaughter to seek out his dwelling</l>
     <l>Then at early morn was with dawn of day</l>
     <l>Grendel's war-craft made known to men:</l>
     <pb n="5"/>
     <l>Then after his meal was wailing upraised,</l>
     <l>A great morning-cry: the mighty prince,</l>
     <l n="130">The honored chief, sorrowful sat,</l>
     <l>The strong man suffered, thane-sorrow endured,</l>
     <l>After the foeman's footsteps they beheld,</l>
     <l>The cursed demon's: too severe was that sorrow,</l>
     <l>Loathsome and lasting. No longer time was it,</l>
     <l n="135">But after one night he again wrought</l>
     <l>More deeds of murder, and did not shrink from</l>
     <l>Hatred and evil: too firm he was in them.</l>
     <l>Then was easy to find one who elsewhere,</l>
     <l>Farther removed, rest for himself sought,</l>
     <l n="140">A bed next the chambers, since to him was shown,</l>
     <l>Truly was said by a manifest sign</l>
     <l>The hall-thane's hatred: he held himself after</l>
     <l>Further and firmer, who 'scaped from the fiend.</l>
     <l>So then he reigned and strove against right</l>
     <l n="145">Alone against all, until empty stood</l>
     <l>The finest of houses. Long was the time:</l>
     <l>Twelve winters' time suffering endured</l>
     <l>The friend of the Scyldings, each one of woes,</l>
     <l>Of sorrows extreme: therefore was this misery</l>
     <l n="150">Openly known to the children of men,</l>
     <l>Sadly in songs, that Grendel contended</l>
     <l>A while against Hrothgar, hateful war waged,</l>
     <l>Evil and enmity many half-years,</l>
     <l>Contests continual; peacefully would not</l>
     <l n="155">From any one man of the might of the Danes</l>
     <l>Life-bale remove, nor with money compound;</l>
     <l>No one of the wise men need there expect</l>
     <l>A ransom more splendid at the murderer's hands</l>
     <l>The terrible demon harassing was,</l>
     <l n="160">Dark death-shadow, the old and the young,</l>
     <l>Caught and entrapped them; in constant night held</l>
     <l>The misty moors: men know not indeed</l>
     <pb n="6"/>
     <l>Whither hell's demons wander in crowds.</l>
     <l>So many foul deeds the foe of mankind,</l>
     <l n="165">The terrible lone one, often enacted,</l>
     <l>Direful afflictions; Heorot he dwelt in.</l>
     <l>The costly-decked hall, on the dark nights;</l>
     <l>Yet must he not the rich gift-stool approach</l>
     <l>For the Creator, nor wish for it know.</l>
     <l n="170">That was great sorrow of the friend of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l>Misery of mind ! Many oft sat</l>
     <l>Mighty in council; plans they devised,</l>
     <l>What with bold mind then would be best</l>
     <l>'Gainst the sudden attacks for them to do.</l>
     <l n="175">Sometimes they vowed at their temples of idols</l>
     <l>To their gods worship, with words they prayed</l>
     <l>The destroyer of spirits would render them help</l>
     <l>Against their folk-sorrows. Such was their custom,</l>
     <l>Hope of the heathen: hell they remembered</l>
     <l n="180">In their minds' thoughts; the Creator they knew not,</l>
     <l>Judge of their deeds: the good Lord they knew not,</l>
     <l>Heaven's protector could they not praise,</l>
     <l>The King of glory. Woe be to him who shall,</l>
     <l>Through deadly hate, thrust down his soul</l>
     <l n="185">Into the fire-abyss; for comfort he'll hope not,</l>
     <l>By no means return ! Well be to him who may,</l>
     <l>After his death-day, seek for the Lord,</l>
     <l>In the Father's bosom mercy beseech!</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="189">
     <head>III</head>
     <l>So then great sorrow Healfdene's son</l>
     <l n="190">Continually suffered: might not the wise chieftain</l>
     <l>His woes remove: too great was that pain,</l>
     <l>Loathsome and lasting, that came on the people,</l>
     <pb n="7"/>
     <l>Dreadful distress, greatest of night-bales.</l>
     <l>That from home learnt Higelac's thane,</l>
     <l n="195">Good 'mong the Geats, the deeds of Grendel;</l>
     <l>He was of mankind strongest in might</l>
     <l>In the day then of this mortal life,</l>
     <l>Noble and great. For him a ship bade he</l>
     <l>A good one prepare, quoth, he the war-king</l>
     <l n="200">Over the swan-road wished to seek out,</l>
     <l>The mighty prince, since he need had of men.</l>
     <l>That journey to him the cunning churls</l>
     <l>Not at all blamed, though he lear to them was.</l>
     <l>They whetted the brave one, good omens they saw</l>
     <l n="205">The good one had of the Geats' people</l>
     <l>Warriors chosen, of those whom he bravest</l>
     <l>Was able to find: one of fifteen</l>
     <l>The vessel he sought: a warrior made known,</l>
     <l>A sea-crafty man, the neighboring landmarks.</l>
     <l n="210">Thus time went on: on the waves was the ship,</l>
     <l>Boat under the mountain. The heroes ready</l>
     <l>On the prow stied: the billows rolled</l>
     <l>The sea 'gainst the sand. The warriors bore</l>
     <l>On the deck of the ship ornaments bright,</l>
     <l n="215">Equipments ornate: the men shoved out,</l>
     <l>Men on willing journey, the well-fitted wood.</l>
     <l>Went then o'er the waves, by the wind hastened,</l>
     <l>The foamy-necked float to a fowl most like,</l>
     <l>Till at the same hour of the following day</l>
     <l n="220">The curv√©d prow had traversed the water.</l>
     <l>So that the sailors then saw the land,</l>
     <l>The sea-cliffs shine, the mountains steep,</l>
     <l>The broad sea-nesses. Then was the sea-goer</l>
     <l>At the end of its voyage. Thence quickly up</l>
     <l n="225">The Weders' people on the plain stied,</l>
     <l>The sea-wood tied, their battle-sarks rattled,</l>
     <l>Their weeds of war: thanked they then God</l>
     <pb n="8"/>
     <l>That for them the sea-paths easy were found.</l>
     <l>Then saw from the wall the guard of the Scyldings,</l>
     <l n="230">He who the sea-cliffs was set to hold,</l>
     <l>Bear o'er the bulwarks bright-looking shields,</l>
     <l>Weapons ready for war: wonder aroused him</l>
     <l>In his mind's thoughts as to what these men were.</l>
     <l>Went he then to the sea on his steed riding,</l>
     <l n="235">The thane of Hrothgar; with might he shook</l>
     <l>The strong wood in his hands, with formal words spoke:</l>
     <l>"What now are ye of arms-bearing men</l>
     <l>With burnies protected, who thus a high keel</l>
     <l>Over the sea-path bringing have come</l>
     <l n="240">O'er the waves hither, clad in helmets?</l>
     <l>I was the coast-guard, sea-watch I kept</l>
     <l>That no one of foes on the Danes' land</l>
     <l>With a ship-army injury might do.</l>
     <l>Not here more openly ever have come</l>
     <l n="245">Bearers of shields! Ye the permission</l>
     <l>Of warlike men did not well know,</l>
     <l>Consent of kinsmen ! Ne'er saw I a greater</l>
     <l>Earl upon earth than is one of you,</l>
     <l>A hero in armor: that is no home-stayer</l>
     <l n="250">With weapons adorned, unless looks belie him,</l>
     <l>His peerless appearance. Now I of you shall</l>
     <l>The origin learn, ere ye far hence,</l>
     <l>Like to false spies, in the land of the Danes</l>
     <l>Further advance. Now ye far-dwelling,</l>
     <l n="255">Sea-faring men, give willing ear</l>
     <l>To my simple thought: haste now is best</l>
     <l>To make plainly known whence is your coming.'</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="258">
     <head>IV</head>
     <l>To him then the princely one quickly replied,</l>
     <l>The war-band's leader his word-hoard unlocked:</l>
     <l n="260">"We are of the race of the Geats' people,</l>
     <l>And are of Hygelac hearth-companions.</l>
     <pb n="9"/>
     <l>My own father was well-known to the folk,</l>
     <l>A princely ruler, Ecgtheow called:</l>
     <l>Many winters he lived ere he away went</l>
     <l n="265">Aged from his dwelling: him well remembers</l>
     <l>Each one of the wise men wide through the earth.</l>
     <l>With friendly mind we thine own lord,</l>
     <l>Healfdene's son, seeking are come,</l>
     <l>The people's protector. Be thou our informant.</l>
     <l n="270">We have to the mighty a mickle errand,</l>
     <l>To the lord of the Danes: nor shall aught be hidden</l>
     <l>Of this, as I think. Thou knowest, if it is,</l>
     <l>As we indeed truly have heard it said,</l>
     <l>That 'mong the Scyldings I know not what foe,</l>
     <l n="275">A secret enemy, on the dark nights,</l>
     <l>Shows by his terror hatred unknown,</l>
     <l>Oppression and slaughter. I for that Hrothgar</l>
     <l>With kindly mind counsel may give,</l>
     <l>How he, old and good, shall the foe overcome,</l>
     <l n="280">If yet for him ever should cease</l>
     <l>The misery of woes, release again come,</l>
     <l>And the care-waves cooler become;</l>
     <l>Or ever hereafter a time of trouble,</l>
     <l>Oppression he'll suffer, while there remains</l>
     <l n="285">In its high place the noblest of houses."</l>
     <l>The warden spoke, where on his horse sat</l>
     <l>The fearless warrior: "Of each of these shall</l>
     <l>A wise shield-warrior the difference know,</l>
     <l>Of words and works, he who well judgeth.</l>
     <l n="290">I that do hear, that this band is friendly</l>
     <l>To the lord of the Scyldings; go then forth bearing</l>
     <l>Your weapons and war-weeds; I shall direct you:</l>
     <l>Likewise my war-thanes I shall command</l>
     <l>Against any foe this vessel of yours,</l>
     <l n="295">The newly-tarred boat, on the sea-sand</l>
     <l>With honor to hold, till back shall bear</l>
     <pb n="10"/>
     <l>O'er the sea-waves the friendly man</l>
     <l>The curved-prowed craft to Wedermark.</l>
     <l>To such a good-doer will it be granted,</l>
     <l n="800">That this battle-storm he safe shall escape."</l>
     <l>Then journeyed they on: the boat remained still,</l>
     <l>In the bay rested the broad-bosomed ship,</l>
     <l>At anchor fast. The boar's likeness shone:</l>
     <l>Over the visor, with gold adorned,</l>
     <l n="305">Bright and fire-hardened, the boar kept guard.</l>
     <l>The fierce-minded hurried, the heroes hastened,</l>
     <l>Together they went, till the well-built hall,</l>
     <l>Shining and gold-adorned, they might perceive:</l>
     <l>That was the foremost to dwellers on earth</l>
     <l n="310">Of halls under heavens, in which the king dwelt;</l>
     <l>The light from it shone o'er many of lands.</l>
     <l>To them then the warrior the court of the proud</l>

     <l>Dark under the clouds. The crowd all arose:</l>
     <l>Greeted then glad-minded one man another,</l>
     <l>Hrothgar Beowulf, and offered him hail,</l>
     <l>Power o'er the mead-hall, and this word spoke:</l>
     <l n="655">" Never to any man ere did I trust,</l>
     <l>Since I could lift my hand and my shield,</l>
     <l>Royal hall of the Danes except to thee now.</l>

     <l>Of glory be mindful, a hero's might show,</l>
     <l n="660">Watch 'gainst the foe. No wish shalt thou want,</l>
     <l>If thou the great struggle escapest with life."</l>

     <head>X</head>
     <l>Then Hrothgar went with his warrior-band,</l>
     <l>The prince of the Scyldings, out of the hall:</l>
     <l>The war-prince would Wealhtheow seek,</l>
     <l n="665">His queen as companion. The glory of kings</l>
     <l>Grendel against, as men heard say,</l>
     <l>A hall-guard had set: he performed special service</l>
     <l>For the prince of the Danes, he eoten-guard kept.</l>
     <l>Now the prince of the Geats earnestly trusted</l>
     <l n="670">In his proud might, in the Creator's favor.</l>
     <l>Then he laid him aside his iron burnie,</l>
     <l>Helmet from head, his jewelled sword gave,</l>
     <l>Choicest of weapons, to his servant-thane,</l>
     <l>And bade him keep his armor of war.</l>
     <l n="675">Then spoke the hero some boastful words,</l>
     <l>Beowulf the Geat, ere he on bed stied:</l>
     <l>"I count not myself less good in war-might</l>
     <l>For deeds of battle than Grendel himself:</l>
     <l>Therefore with my sword I him will not kill,</l>
     <l n="680">Of life deprive, though I it all may.</l>
     <l>He knows not these goods, so that he me may slay</l>
     <l>Hew down my shield, although he be fierce</l>
     <l>In hostile deeds: but we at night shall</l>
     <l>From swords refrain, if he dare to seek</l>
     <l n="685">War without weapons; and then the wise God,</l>
     <l>The holy Lord, on whatever hand</l>
     <l>May the glory adjudge, as seems to Him fit."</l>
     <l>Then lay down the warlike: the pillow received</l>
     <l>The cheeks of the earl, and him around many</l>
     <l n="690">A valiant sea-warrior sought his hall-rest.</l>
     <l>No one of these thought that thence he should</l>
     <pb n="22"/>
     <l>Again his dear home ever seek out,</l>
     <l>Folk or free-city where he was reared;</l>
     <l>But they had heard that too many before</l>
     <l n="695">In this wine-hall bloody death carried off</l>
     <l>Of the folk of the Danes. But to them the Lord gave</l>
     <l>The web of war-speed, to the folk of the Weders</l>
     <l>Comfort and help, so that they their foes</l>
     <l>Through the craft of one all overcame,</l>
     <l n="700">By the might of one self: the truth is made known</l>
     <l>That the mighty God the race of man</l>
     <l>Has always ruled. - Came in wan night</l>
     <l>The shadow-goer stepping. The warriors slept,</l>
     <l>Who the horned hall then were to hold,</l>
     <l n="705">All except one. That was to men known,</l>
     <l>That them he might not, whom the Creator would not,</l>
     <l>The hostile demon drag into darkness;</l>
     <l>But he keeping watch for his foe in anger</l>

     <head>XI</head>
     <l n="710">Then came from the moor 'neath the misty slopes</l>
     <l>Grendel going, God's anger he bore.</l>
     <l>The wicked foe thought of the race of man</l>
     <l>Some one to entrap in that high hall:</l>
     <l>He went 'neath the clouds whither he the wine-hall,</l>
     <l n="715">The gold-hall of men, most thoroughly knew,</l>
     <l>Shining with gold-plates: that was not the first time</l>
     <l>That he of Hrothgar the home had sought.</l>
     <l>Ne'er in his life-time before nor after</l>
     <l>Bolder warriors, hall-thanes, did he find!</l>
     <l n="720">Then came to the hall the being approaching,</l>
     <l>Of joys deprived. The door soon sprang open</l>
     <l>Fast in its fire-bands, when he with hands touched it;</l>
     <l>Then burst the bale-bringer, since he was enraged,</l>
     <l>The door of the hall. Soon after that</l>
     <l n="725">On the many-colored floor the fiendish one trod,</l>
     <pb n="23"/>
     <l>Mad in mind went: from his eyes stood</l>
     <l>A loathsome light likest to flame.</l>
     <l>He saw in the hall many of warriors.</l>
     <l>A band in peace sleeping all together,</l>
     <l n="730">A heap of kin-warriors. Then laughed his mood</l>
     <l>He thought that he would, ere day came, divide,</l>
     <l>The terrible monster, of every one</l>
     <l>The life from the body, since to him was fallen</l>
     <l>A hope of much food. That no longer was fitted.</l>
     <l n="735">That he might more of the race of man</l>
     <l>Devour by night. The strong-in-might saw,</l>
     <l>The kinsman of Hygelac, how the fell foe</l>
     <l>With his swift attacks was going to act.</l>
     <l>That did not the monster think to delay,</l>
     <l n="740">But quickly he seized for the first time</l>
     <l>A sleeping warrior, him tore unresisting,</l>
     <l>Bit his bone-frame, drank blood from his veins,</l>
     <l>In great bites him swallowed: soon then he had,</l>
     <l>Deprived of life, him all devoured,</l>
     <l n="745">Feet even and hands. Forth nearer he stepped,</l>
     <l>Seized then with his hands the firm-in-mind</l>
     <l>Warrior at rest. Him reached out agaist</l>
     <l>The fiend with his hand: quickly he seized</l>
     <l>The cunning-in-mind and on his arm sat.</l>
     <l n="750">Soon this perceived the worker of evil,</l>
     <l>That he never found in this mid-earth,</l>
     <l>In the regions of earth, in another man</l>
     <l>A greater hand-grip: in mood he became</l>
     <l>In his soul frightened; he could not sooner forth.</l>
     <l n="755">His mind was death-ready; into darkness would flee,</l>
     <l>The devil-band seek: his course was not there,</l>
     <l>As he in old-days before had found.</l>
     <l>Remembered he then, good kinsman of Hygelac,</l>
     <l>His evening-speech; upright he stood</l>
     <l n="760">And him fast seized: his fingers cracked</l>
     <pb n="24"/>
     <l>The eoten would outwards: the earl further stepped;</l>
     <l>The mighty one thought, whereso he might,</l>
     <l>Afar to escape, and away thence</l>
     <l>Flee into the marshes: he knew that his fingers</l>
     <l n="765">Were in his foe's grip: that was a bad journey</l>
     <l>That the harm-bringing foe had taken to Heorot:</l>
     <l>The royal hall sounded: for all the Danes was,</l>
     <l>The city-dwellers, each one of the bold,</l>
     <l>For earls the ale spilt. Angry were both</l>
     <l n="770">Furious contestants: the hall cracked aloud:</l>
     <l>Then was it great wonder that the wine-hall</l>
     <l>Withstood the fierce fighters, that it to ground fell not,</l>
     <l>The fair folk-hall: but it was too fast</l>
     <l>Within and without in its iron bands</l>
     <l n="775">By cunning skill forged. There from the sill fell</l>
     <l>Many a mead-bench, as I have heard say,</l>
     <l>Adorned with gold, where the foes fought.</l>
     <l>Of this before weened not wise men of the Scyldings</l>
     <l>That it ever with strength any of men,</l>
     <l n="780">Goodly and bone-adorned, to pieces might break,</l>
     <l>With craft destroy, unless flame's embrace</l>
     <l>In smoke should it swallow. The sound arose</l>
     <l>Often repeated: to the North-Danes stood</l>
     <l>Fearful terror, to every one</l>
     <l n="785">Of those who from the wall the weeping heard,</l>
     <l>The terrible song sung of th' opposer of God,</l>
     <l>The joyless song, his pain lament</l>
     <l>The prisoner of hell. He held him too fast,</l>

     <l>They knew not indeed, when they risked the contest,</l>

     <l n="800">And on each side they thought to hew,</l>
     <l>To seek his soul, that the fiendish demon</l>

     <l>No one of war-swords, was able to touch,</l>

     <l>Then that he perceived, he who oft before</l>

     <l>His crimes had wrought, hostile to God,</l>
     <l>That his body's frame him would not sustain,</l>
     <l>But him the proud kinsman of Ilygelac</l>
     <l>Had by the hands: each was to other</l>
     <l n="815">Living a foe. Pain of body endured</l>
     <l>The terrible monster: there was on his shoulder</l>
     <l>An evident wound; apart sprang the sinews,</l>
     <l>The bone-frame burst. To Beowulf was</l>
     <l>Battle-fame given: Grendel should thence</l>
     <l n="820">Sick-of-life flee under the fen-slopes,</l>
     <l>Seek his joyless abode; too surely he knew</l>
     <l>That of his life the end was come,</l>
     <l>The span of his days. To all of the Danes</l>
     <l>By the bloody strife was the wish fulfilled;</l>
     <l n="825">He then had cleansed, who ere came from afar,</l>

     <l>Then was in the morning, as I have heard say,</l>
     <l>Around the gift-hall many a warrior:</l>
     <l>The people's leaders from far and near came</l>
     <l n="840">Through the wide ways the wonder to view,</l>
     <l>The tracks of the foe. Ne'er did his life-severing</l>
     <l>Sorrowful seem to any of men,</l>
     <l>Of those who then viewed the track of the vanquished,</l>
     <l>How weary in mind he away thence,</l>
     <l n="845">In fight overcome, to the mere of the nickers,</l>
     <l>Doomed and driven, his life-tracks bore.</l>
     <l>There was the surface welling in blood;</l>
     <l>The frightful waves' lashing all commingled</l>
     <l>Hot in gore boiled with the sword-blood ;</l>
     <l n="850">The doomed-to-death dyed them, when of joys deprived</l>

     <l>His heathen soul, where hell him received.</l>
     <l>Thence back again came the old companions,</l>
     <l>And many a young one from their glad course,</l>
     <l n="855">From the sea proudly riding on horses,</l>
     <l>Heroes on steeds. There then was Beowulf's</l>
     <pb n="27"/>
     <l>Glory proclaimed : oft many said</l>
     <l>That south nor north by the two seas</l>
     <l>O'er the wide earth no other one</l>
     <l n="860">'Neath heaven's expanse was better than he</l>
     <l>Of bearers of shields, more worthy of rule.</l>
     <l>They did not now at all their dear lord blame,</l>
     <l>The friendly Hrothgar, but that was a good king.</l>
     <l>Sometimes the battle-famed permitted to leap,</l>
     <l n="865">In contest to go, their yellow horses</l>
     <l>Where the land-roads seemed to them fair,</l>
     <l>Known for their goodness. Sometimes a king's thane,</l>
     <l>A man renowned, mindful of songs,</l>
     <l>He who very many of old-time sagas,</l>

     <l>Rightly connected: the scope then began</l>
     <l>Beowulf's exploit with skill to tell,</l>
     <l>And with art to relate well-composed tales,</l>
     <l>Words to exchange; he told everything</l>
     <l n="875">That he of Sigemund had heard men say,</l>
     <l>His noble deeds, much of the unknown,</l>

     <l>The very bold deed; not with him was Fitela;</l>

     <l>The wonderful worm, that it in the wall stood,</l>
     <l>The lordly weapon; in death lay the dragon.</l>

     <l>So that he the ring-hoard himself might enjoy</l>
     <l n="895">At his own will; he loaded his vessel,</l>
     <l>Bore on the ship's bosom the ornaments bright,</l>
     <l>The son of Waels; the worm's heat melted him.</l>
     <l>He was of exiles the greatest by far</l>
     <l>Among the nations, the warriors' defence</l>
     <l n="900">In noble deeds; for that ere had he glory.</l>
     <l>After of IIeremod the battle-might failed.</l>
     <l>His strength and prowess, he was 'mong the Jutes</l>
     <l>Into his foe's power forthwith betrayed,</l>
     <l>Sent away quickly: him waves of sorrow</l>
     <l n="905">Too long oppressed; he was to his people,</l>
     <l>To all of his princes, a life-long distress:</l>

     <l>Adorned with gold and at Grendel's hand):</l>
     <l>" For this glad sight thanks to the Almighty</l>
     <l>Quickly be given! Much evil I suffered,</l>
     <l n="930">Sorrows from Grendel: God may ever work</l>
     <l>Wonder on wonder, King of glory.</l>
     <l>Lately it was that I for myself</l>
     <l>Of any of woes weened not my life long</l>
     <l>Relief to obtain, since stained with blood</l>
     <l n="935">The noblest of houses drenched in gore stood;</l>
     <l>Woe was brought down on every wise man,</l>
     <l>Of those who weened not that they in their lives</l>
     <l>The people's land-work from foes might defend,</l>
     <l>From demons and devils. Now hath a hero,</l>
     <l n="940">Through the Lord's might, a deed performed,</l>
     <l>Which we all before were not at all able</l>
     <l>With wisdom to work. Lo! this may say</l>
     <l>Even whatever woman brought forth this son</l>
     <l>After man's nature, if she yet liveth,</l>
     <l n="945">That to her the eternal Creator was gracious</l>
     <l>In her child-bearing. Now I thee, Beowulf,</l>
     <l>Noblest of men, for myself as a son</l>

     <l>The kinship new. To thee shall no lack be</l>
     <l n="950">Of earthly wishes o'er which I have power.</l>
     <l>Very often for less have I fixed the reward,</l>
     <l>The share of the treasure, to warrior less brave,</l>
     <l>One worse in the fight. Thou hast for thyself</l>
     <l>Effected by deeds that thy fame shall live</l>
     <l n="955">For ever and ever. May thee the Almighty</l>
     <l>With good repay, as He heretofore did !"</l>
     <l>Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>
     <l>"That deed of might we, with great good-will,</l>

     <pb n="30"/>
     <l n="960">The strength of the unknown: I rather would wish</l>
     <l>That thou himself now mightest see,</l>

     <l>I quickly him with hardest grips</l>
     <l>Thought then to bind on the death-bed,</l>
     <l n="965">That he by hand-grip of mine should lie</l>
     <l>Striving for life, if his body escaped not:</l>
     <l>I might not him, since the Creator willed not,</l>
     <l>Cut off from escape: not so firm held I him,</l>
     <l>The life-destroyer: too powerful was he,</l>
     <l n="970">The foe in his speed. Yet his hand did he let</l>
     <l>For life-protection remain behind,</l>
     <l>His arm and shoulder: not there, however,</l>
     <l>Did the helpless man gain any comfort.</l>
     <l>Not longer shall live the evil-doer</l>
     <l n="975">Burdened with sins, but him sore pain</l>
     <l>In his strong grip sternly has seized,</l>

     <l>How the glorious Creator to him will prescribe."</l>

     <l n="995">The webs on the walls, many wondrous sights</l>
     <l>To each one of men, who on such look.</l>
     <l>That building bright was very much injured,</l>
     <l>All the interior in its iron-bands fast;</l>
     <l>The hinges were shivered; the roof alone saved</l>
     <l n="1000">Entirely sound, when had the monster,</l>
     <l>Condemned for his crimes, in flight escaped,</l>
     <l>Hopeless of life. It will not be easy</l>

     <l>But each shall obtain of soul-bearing men,</l>
     <l n="1005">By necessity fixed for the children of men,</l>

     <l>That to the hall went Healfdene's son,</l>

     <l>Ne'er heard I that folk in greater crowd</l>

     <l>Went then to the benches the heroes renowned</l>
     <l>Rejoiced at the plenty: courteously shared</l>
     <l n="1015">Many a mead-cup the kinsmen of these,</l>
     <l>The bold-minded ones in the high hall,</l>
     <l>Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot within</l>

     <l>Did the Folk-Scyldings at this time prepare.</l>
     <pb n="32"/>
     <l n="1020">Gave then to Beowulf Healfdene's son</l>

     <l>A great jewelled sword many then saw</l>
     <l>Before the chief borne. Beowulf received</l>
     <l n="1025">The cup in the hall. Not of that treasure-giving</l>
     <l>Before the warriors need he be ashamed:</l>
     <l>Ne'er heard I, more courteously, that treasures four</l>

     <l n="1030">'Round the crown of the helmet head-protection</l>
     <l>A loss wound with wires was keeping without,</l>
     <l>That him the battle-swords boldly might not,</l>
     <l>By file hardened, injure, when the shield-warrior</l>
     <l>Against his foes in battle should go.</l>
     <l n="1035">The earl's defence eight horses ordered,</l>
     <l>With golden trappings, to lead in the hall</l>
     <l>In under the barriers: on one of these stood</l>
     <l>A saddle art-decked, with treasure adorned;</l>
     <l>That was the battle-seat of the high king,</l>
     <l n="040">When in sword-play Healfdene's son</l>
     <l>Wished to engage; ne'er at the front failed</l>
     <l>The famed one's valor when corpses fell.</l>
     <l>And then to Beowulf of each of the two</l>
     <l>The prince of the Ingwins power delivered,</l>
     <l n="1045">Of horses and weapons: bade him well use them.</l>
     <l>So like a man the noble prince,</l>
     <l>The hoard-keeper of heroes, contests repaid</l>
     <l>With horses and treasures, such as never will blame</l>
     <l>He who will speak truth according to right.</l>

     <l>A sword as an heir-loom, and bade for that one</l>

     <l>In fight with Hengest at all contend,</l>
     <l>Nor even the remnant rescue by war</l>
     <l n="1085">From the chief's thane : but they offered them terms,</l>

     <l>In the beer-hall would encourage.</l>
     <l n="1095">Then they confirmed on either side</l>

     <l>In valor invincible, promised with oaths</l>
     <l>That he the remnant, by the doom of his wise men,</l>
     <l>In honor would hold, that no man there</l>
     <l n="1100">By words nor works the compact should break,</l>

     <l>If then of the Frisians any one with bold speech</l>
     <l n="1105">Of that bloody feud mindful should be,</l>
     <l>Then the edge of the sword it should avenge.</l>
     <l>The oath was confirmed and treasure of gold</l>

     <l n="1110">At the funeral-pile was easily seen</l>

     <l>More eagerly thought than on the sea-voyage,</l>

     <l>So he did not escape the fate of the world</l>
     <l>When Hunlaf's son a battle-sword,</l>
     <l>Best of weapons, thrust in his breast;</l>
     <l n="1145">Well-known were its edges among the Jutes.</l>
     <l>Also, bold-minded Finn afterwards befell</l>
     <l>Death-bringing sword-bale at his own home,</l>
     <l>When the fierce battle Guthlaf and Oslaf</l>
     <l>After their sea-journey in sorrow lamented,</l>
     <l n="1150">Blamed him for their woes: his flickering life might not</l>
     <l>Keep itself in his breast. Then was the hall covered</l>
     <l>With bodies of foes; also was Finn slain,</l>
     <l>The king 'mong his band, and the queen taken.</l>
     <l>The Scyldings' warriors bore to their ships</l>

     <l>A mighty fell foe, her son would avenge,</l>
     <l n="1340">And further has laid her feud upon us;</l>
     <l>Wherefore it may seem to many a thane,</l>

     <l>Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>

     <l>Each of us shall the end await</l>

     <l>When he is dead, afterwards best.</l>
     <l n="1390">Arise, kingdom's guardian! Let us quickly go</l>
     <l>To view the track of Grendel's kinsman.</l>
     <l>I promise it thee: he will not escape,</l>
     <l>Nor in earth's bosom, nor in mountain-wood,</l>
     <l>Nor in ocean's depths, go where he will.</l>
     <l n="1395">Throughout this day do thou patience have</l>
     <l>Of each of thy woes, as I ween of thee !"</l>
     <l>Up leaped the ag√©d one, thanked he then God,</l>
     <l>The mighty Lord, for what the man spoke.</l>
     <l>Then was for Hrothgar a horse provided,</l>
     <l n="1400">A steed with curled mane: the ruler wise</l>
     <l>Well-equipped went; the band stepped forth</l>
     <l>Of bearers of shields. The foot-tracks were</l>
     <l>On the forest-paths widely perceived,</l>
     <l>The course o'er the plain: she went straight ahead</l>
     <l n="1405">O'er the murky moor, of knightly thanes bore</l>
     <l>The noblest one deprived of life,</l>
     <l>Of those who with Hrothgar defended his home.</l>
     <l>Went he then over, the offspring of princes,</l>
     <l>The steep, stony slopes, the narrow ways,</l>
     <l n="1410">The strait single paths, the unknown course,</l>
     <l>The headlands steep, many houses of nickers.</l>
     <l>He one of few went on before,</l>

     <l>Until he all at once the mountain-trees</l>

     <l>To the friends of the Scyldings, bitter in mood,</l>
     <l>To many a thane sorrow to suffer,</l>
     <l n="1420">To each one of earls, after of Aeschere</l>
     <l>On the holm-cliff the head they found.</l>
     <l>The flood boiled with blood (the people looked on),</l>
     <l>With the hot gore. The horn at times sang</l>
     <l>The ready war-song. All the warriors sat down;</l>
     <l n="1425">They saw then in the water many of worm-kind,</l>
     <l>Strange sea-dragons, seeking the sea,</l>
     <l>Such nickers lying out on the ness-slopes,</l>
     <l>As at mid-day often prepare</l>
     <l>A sorrowful voyage on the sail-road,</l>
     <l n="1430">Worms and wild beasts: rushed they away</l>
     <l>Fierce and angry; the noise they perceived</l>
     <l>The war-horn sound. The prince of the Geats</l>
     <l>With his arrowed bow deprived one of life,</l>
     <l>Of strife with the sea, so that stood in his vitals</l>
     <l n="1435">The hard war-arrow: he was in the holm</l>
     <l>The slower in swimming, whom death took away.</l>
     <l>Quickly was in the waves with their boar-spears,</l>
     <l>Their hooked swords, fiercely attacked,</l>
     <l>Pressed after with struggles and to the ness drawn,</l>
     <l n="1440">The wonderful monster: the men looked upon</l>
     <l>The terrible stranger. Beowulf girded him</l>
     <l>With noble armor, not for life did he care:</l>
     <l>The war-burnie should, woven with hands,</l>
     <l>Wide and well-wrought, seek out the sea,</l>
     <l n="1445">That which his body could well protect,</l>
     <l>So that him battle-grip might not in breast,</l>
     <l>The mad one's assault, injure in life:</l>
     <l>But the bright helmet protected his head,</l>
     <l>Which was to mingle with the depths of the sea,</l>
     <l n="1450">Adorned with treasure seek the sea-waves,</l>
     <l>Encircled with diadem, as in days of old</l>
     <pb n="45"/>
     <l>The weapon-smith wrought it, wondrously framed it</l>
     <l>Set with swine-bodies, so that it never after</l>
     <l>The flaming war-swords might be able to bite.</l>
     <l n="1455">That was not then the least of strong helps,</l>
     <l>That to him in need Hrothgar's orator lent:</l>
     <l>Of that hilted sword Hrunting was name;</l>
     <l>That was a chief one of old-time treasures;</l>
     <l>Its edge was of iron, with poison-twigs stained,</l>
     <l n="1460">Hardened with battle-gore; ne'er failed it in fight</l>
     <l>Any of men, who it wielded with hand,</l>
     <l>He who durst tread the terrible paths,</l>
     <l>The folk-place of foes: that was not the first time,</l>
     <l>That deeds of valor it should perform.</l>
     <l n="1465">The kinsman of Ecglaf remembered not now,</l>
     <l>Mighty in strength, what he before spoke</l>
     <l>Drunken with wine, when the weapon he lent</l>
     <l>To a better sword-bearer; he himself durst not</l>
     <l>Under waves' tumult venture his life,</l>
     <l n="1470">Heroic deeds work; there he lost fame,</l>

     <l>Beowulf then spoke, Ecgtheow's son:</l>

     <l>Gold-friend of men, of what we once spoke,</l>
     <l>If I in thy service should at any time</l>
     <l>Of my life be deprived, that thou wouldst ever be</l>
     <l>To me when gone hence, in stead of a father.</l>
     <l n="1480">Be thou a protector to my knightly thanes,</l>
     <l>My trusty comrades, if war take me off:</l>
     <l>Also the treasures, which thou gavest me,</l>
     <l>Do thou, dear Hrothgar, to Hygelac send.</l>
     <l>May then by the gold the Geat's lord perceive,</l>
     <l n="1485">Hrethel's son see, when he looks on the treasure,</l>
     <l>That I did one find in man's virtues good,</l>
     <pb n="46"/>
     <l>A giver of rings, him enjoyed while I might.</l>
     <l>And do thou let Hunferth the ancient relic,</l>

     <l n="1490">The hard-edged have. I shall with Hrunting</l>
     <l>Fame for me gain, or death will me take."</l>
     <l>After these words the prince of the Weder-Geats</l>
     <l>Hastened with valor, not for an answer</l>
     <l>Would he await. The water-flood took</l>
     <l n="1495">The mighty warrior: then was a day's space</l>
     <l>Ere the bottom-plain he might perceive.</l>
     <l>Soon that discovered she who the flood's realm,</l>
     <l>Eager for blood, for fifty years held,</l>
     <l>Grim and greedy, that there some one of men</l>
     <l n="1500">The monster's abode sought out from above.</l>
     <l>She grasped then against him, the warrior seized</l>
     <l>In her terrible claws; not sooner she injured</l>
     <l>His body sound: the burnie him shielded,</l>
     <l>So that she might not pierce through the corslet,</l>
     <l n="1505">The locked linked sark, with fiendish fingers.</l>
     <l>Bore then the sea-wolf, when she came to the bottom,</l>
     <l>The giver of rings to her own abode,</l>
     <l>So that he might not, tho' he was brave,</l>
     <l>His weapons wield, but him many strange ones</l>
     <l n="1510">Oppressed in the sea: many a sea-beast</l>
     <l>With battle-tusks his war-sark brake;</l>
     <l>The monsters harassed him. The earl then perceived</l>
     <l>That he in sea-hall, he knew not what, was,</l>
     <l>Where him no water in aught might harm,</l>
     <l n="1515">Nor for the roofed hall might lay hold of him</l>
     <l>Sudden grip of the flood: the fire-light he saw,</l>
     <l>The brilliant beams brightly shining.</l>
     <l>The good one perceived then the wolf of the bottom,</l>
     <l>The mighty mere-woman; he gave a strong stroke</l>
     <pb n="47"/>
     <l n="1520">With his battle-bill, withheld not the blow,</l>
     <l>So that on her head the ringed blade sounded</l>
     <l>A greedy war-song. Then the stranger perceived</l>
     <l>That the war-weapon would not cleave through,</l>
     <l>Injure her life, but the edge failed</l>
     <l n="1525">The prince in his need: before it endured</l>
     <l>Many hand-meetings, the helmet oft clave,</l>
     <l>The fated one's corslet: that was the first time</l>
     <l>To the dear treasure that power had failed.</l>
     <l>Again was determined, not lacking in prowess,</l>
     <l n="1530">Mindful of fame, the kinsman of Hygelac:</l>
     <l>Then threw the etched brand, with jewels adorned,</l>
     <l>The angry warrior, that it on the earth lay,</l>

     <l>The hand-grip of might: so shall a man do,</l>
     <l n="1535">When he in war thinketh to gain</l>
     <l>Praise everlasting, nor for his life careth.</l>
     <l>Seized then by the shoulder (cared she not for the contest)</l>
     <l>The War-Geats' prince Grendel's mother,</l>
     <l>Threw then battle-brave, for he was enraged,</l>
     <l n="1540">The life-destroyer, that she on the floor fell.</l>
     <l>She him again quickly the hand-grip repaid</l>
     <l>With her fierce claws, and seized him fast:</l>
     <l>Then stumbled the weary one, strongest of warriors.</l>
     <l>The fighter-on-foot, so that he fell.</l>
     <l n="1545">She sat on the hall-guest and drew her short sword.</l>
     <l>Broad and brown-edged, her son would avenge,</l>
     <l>Her only child. On his shoulder lay</l>
     <l>The braided breast-net: that his life saved,</l>

     <l>To the war-play was able to bear,</l>
     <l>Good and ornate, the hand-work of giants.</l>

     <l n="1590">The strong sword-stroke, that struck off his head.-</l>

     <l>On account of the battle-gore in clots of blood</l>

     <l n="1610">The ice-rope unwinds, He who has control</l>

     <l>Then was the golden hilt to the old warrior,</l>
     <l>The hoary war-chief, given in hand,</l>
     <l>The old work of giants: it went into the keeping,</l>
     <l n="1680">Since the fall of the devils, of the lord of the Danes,</l>

     <l>Hrothgar then spoke, on the hilt looked,</l>

     <l n="1690">The rushing sea, the race of the giants;</l>
     <l>Badly they fared: that people was hostile</l>
     <l>To the Lord eternal; therefor a reward</l>

     <l>When the dragon awoke, strife was renewed:</l>

     <l>Hot and fierce-minded oft he went 'round the cave</l>

     <l n="2435">There was for the eldest contrary to right</l>
     <l>By the deeds of his kinsman a death-bed prepared,</l>
     <l>Since him did Haethcyn from his horn√©d bow,</l>
     <l>His own dear lord, with arrow pierce,</l>
     <l>Missed he the mark and his kinsman did shoot,</l>
     <l n="2440">One brother the other, with bloody dart:</l>

     <l>That was fee-less fight, wickedly sinned,</l>

     <l>The lord unavenged from life depart.</l>
     <l>So is it sorrowful to an aged churl</l>

     <l>The one for the other: too empty all seemed,</l>
     <l>Fields and dwelling. So the Weders' defence</l>
     <l>For Herebeald sorrow of heart</l>
     <l>Welling up bore: he might not at all</l>

     <l>Strife was stirred up; the hoard-keeper knew</l>
     <l n="2555">The voice of a man: there was not more time</l>
     <l>Friendship to seek. First there came forth</l>
     <l>The breath of the monster out of the rock,</l>

     <l>The man 'neath the mountain his shield upraised</l>
     <l n="2560">'Gainst the terrible demon, the lord of the Geats:</l>

     <l n="2580">Oppressed with the fight. Then was the hill's keeper,</l>

     <l>The flame of the battle. Of triumphs he boasted not,</l>
     <l>The gold-friend of the Geats: the war-bill failed</l>
     <l n="2585">Naked in fight, as it should not,</l>

     <l n="2595">Surrounded by fire, who before ruled his folk.</l>
     <l>Not at all in a band did his companions,</l>
     <l>Children of nobles, him stand around</l>
     <l>With warlike virtues, but they to wood went,</l>

     <l n="2700">The hero in armor, that the sword sank in,</l>
     <l>Shining and gold-plated, that the fire began</l>
     <l>After to lessen. Then still the king</l>

     <l>Cutting and battle-sharp, which he bore on his burnie:</l>
     <l n="2705">The Weders' defence cut the serpent in two.</l>
     <l>The foe they felled, force drove out life,</l>
     <l>And they him then both had destroyed,</l>
     <l>Kindred princes: such should a man be,</l>
     <l>A thane in need. That was to the prince</l>
     <pb n="83"/>
     <l n="2710">The last of his victories by his own deeds,</l>
     <l>Of work in the world. Then 'gan the wound,</l>
     <l>Which on him the earth-drake before had inflicted,</l>
     <l>To burn and to swell: that soon he perceived</l>
     <l>That in his breast deadly ill welled,</l>
     <l n="2715">Poison within. Then the prince went,</l>
     <l>So that he by the rock, wise in his mind,</l>
     <l>Sat on his seat, on the giants' work looked,</l>
     <l>How the stone-arches, fast on their columns,</l>
     <l>The earth-hall eternal held there within.</l>
     <l n="2720">Then with his hands him bloody with gore,</l>
     <l>The mighty prince, the excellent thane</l>
     <l>His own dear lord with water laved,</l>
     <l>Weary of battle, and his helmet unloosed.</l>

     <l>Then heard I that quickly Weohstan's son,</l>
     <l>After these words, his wounded lord</l>
     <l>Sick from battle obeyed, bore his ringed net,</l>
     <l n="2755">His battle-sark woven, 'neath the roof of the mountain</l>
     <l>Saw then victorious, when he by the seat went,</l>
     <l>The brave kin-thane many of treasures.</l>
     <l>Glittering gold on the ground lying,</l>
     <l>Wonder on wall and the den of the worm,</l>
     <l n="2760">The old air-flier, drinking-cups standing,</l>
     <l>Vessels of old-time wanting the polisher,</l>
     <l>Deprived of their ornaments. There was many a helmet</l>
     <l>Old and rusty, many arm-bracelets</l>
     <l>Curiously twisted. The treasure may easily,</l>
     <l n="2765">The gold in the ground, each hoard of mankind</l>
     <l>In value exceed, let him hide it who will.</l>
     <l>Likewise he saw standing an all-golden banner</l>
     <l>High over the hoard, greatest of wonders,</l>
     <l>Wrought with hand-craft; from it light stood,</l>
     <l n="2770">So that the ground-plain he might perceive,</l>
     <l>Examine the treasures. There was not of the serpent</l>
     <l>Any appearance, but sword took him off.</l>
     <l>Then I heard say, in the cave the hoard robbed,</l>
     <l>The old work of giants, one man alone,</l>
     <l n="2775">Bore on his bosom the cups and the plates</l>
     <l>At his own will; the banner he took,</l>
     <l>Brightest of beacons, a bill sheathed with brass</l>
     <l>(Its edge was of iron) of the old lord,</l>
     <pb n="85"/>
     <l>Who of these treasures was the protector</l>
     <l n="2780">For a long while, bore fiery terror</l>
     <l>Hot, deadly-rolling, on account of the hoard</l>
     <l>In the midst of the night, till he in death perished.</l>
     <l>In haste was the messenger for return ready,</l>
     <l>Provided with treasures; wonder him moved,</l>
     <l n="2785">Whether he the high-minded alive would find</l>
     <l>In that grassy spot, the prince of the Weders,</l>
     <l>Deprived of strength, where he him before left.</l>
     <l>He then with the treasures the mighty prince,</l>
     <l>His own dear lord, bleeding did find</l>
     <l n="2790">At the end of his life. He began him again</l>
     <l>With water to sprinkle, until the word's point</l>
     <l>Brake through his breast-hoard: Beowulf spoke,</l>
     <l>The old man in sorrow (the gold he viewed):</l>
     <l>"I for these treasures to the Lord of all thanks,</l>
     <l n="2795">To the glorious King, in words do speak,</l>
     <l>To the Lord eternal, - which I here look upon,</l>
     <l>For this that I might for mine own people</l>
     <l>Before my death-day such treasures obtain.</l>
     <l>Now I for the hoard of jewels have paid</l>
     <l n="2800">Mine own aged life; do ye now supply</l>
     <l>The needs of my people; I may not longer be here</l>
     <l>Bid ye the war-famed a mound to make</l>

     <l>Which shall for remembrance to mine own people</l>
     <l n="2805">Raise itself high on the Whale's ness,</l>
     <l>That it the sea-farers hereafter may call</l>
     <l>Beowulf's mound, who shall their high ships</l>
     <l>O'er the sea's mists from afar drive."</l>
     <l>He put from his neck the golden ring,</l>
     <l n="2810">The bold-minded prince, gave to the thane,</l>
     <l>The young spear-warrior, his gold-adorned helm,</l>
     <l>Collar and burnie, bade him use them well:</l>

     <l>That was to the aged the very last word</l>
     <l>In his breast-thoughts, ere the pyre he chose,</l>

     <l>Then it had happened to the young man,</l>

     <l>Showed he his form: but he to earth fell</l>
     <l n="2835">On account of the handwork of this battle-prince.</l>
     <l>Now that in the land to few of men throve</l>

     <l n="2840">Or the ring-hall disturb with his hands,</l>

     <l>On the mount watching. By Beowulf was</l>
     <l>The portion of treasures paid for with death:</l>
     <l>It had for each the end obtained</l>
     <l n="2845">Of fleeting life. -'Twas not then long after</l>
     <l>That the cowardly ones the wood forsook,</l>
     <l>The unwarlike truth-breakers, ten together,</l>
     <l>Who durst not before fight with their spears</l>
     <l>In their liege lord's very great need:</l>
     <l n="2850">But they ashamed bore then their shields,</l>
     <l>Their weeds of war, where the aged one lay;</l>
     <l>They gazed upon Wiglaf. He wearied sat,</l>
     <l>The fighter-on-foot, near his lord's shoulders,</l>
     <l>Refreshed him with water: it naught him availed.</l>
     <l n="2855">He might not on earth, though he well would,</l>

     <l n="2860">Then was from the youth an answer grim</l>
     <l>For him easy gotten, who before lost his valor.</l>
     <l>Wiglaf then spoke, Weohstan's son,</l>

     <l n="2870">From far or nigh he was able to find, -</l>
     <l>That he without doubt the weeds of war</l>
     <l>To no purpose wasted. When war him assailed,</l>

     <pb n="88"/>
     <l>Have cause to boast: yet God him granted,</l>

     <l>Beyond my power my kinsman to help:</l>
     <l n="2880">He was always the worse, when I with the sword struck</l>

     <l n="2915">With his ship-army going to the land of the Frisians,</l>
     <l>Where the Hetwaras felled him in battle,</l>
     <l>Bravely him conquered with their over-might,</l>

     <l n="2920">The prince to his nobles. To us ever after</l>
     <l>The Merwings' friendship was not to be granted.</l>
     <l>Nor do I from the Swedes peace or good faith</l>

     <l>He had of Hygelac's prowess heard tell,</l>

     <l n="2955">His hoard protect from the sea-farers,</l>
     <l>His children and wife; he went after thence</l>

     <l>To the folk of the Swedes, their banner to Hygelac.</l>
     <l>Forth then they went o'er the Peace-plain,</l>
     <l n="2960">After the Hrethlings pressed into the hedge;</l>
     <l>There Ongentheow was, with the edge of the sword,</l>
     <l>The gray-haired one, forced to remain,</l>
     <l>So that the folk-king had to submit</l>
     <l>To Eofor's sole will; angrily him</l>
     <l n="2965">Wulf, son of Wonred, attacked with his weapon,</l>
     <l>So that for the blow blood spurted in streams</l>
     <l>Forth under his hair. He was not though afraid.</l>
     <l>The ag√©d Scylfing, but quickly repaid</l>
     <l>In a worse way that fatal blow,</l>
     <l n="2970">After the folk-king thither turned round:</l>
     <l>Might not then the quick son of Wonred</l>
     <l>To the old churl a hand-stroke give,</l>
     <l>But he on his head his helmet first cleft,</l>
     <l>So that, stained with blood, he had to bow,</l>
     <l n="2975">Fell on the earth: he was not yet fated,</l>
     <l>But he himself raised, though the wound pained him</l>
     <pb n="91"/>
     <l>Then the brave thane of Hygelac let</l>
     <l>With his broad sword, when his brother lay down,</l>
     <l>The old sword of giants, the helmet of giants</l>
     <l n="2980">Break over the shield-rim: then bowed the king,</l>
     <l>The herd of the folk; he was struck to his life.</l>
     <l>Then were there many who bound up his brother,</l>
     <l>Quickly him lifted, when for them it was settled</l>
     <l>That they the battle-place were to possess,</l>
     <l n="2985">Whilst one warrior the other robbed,</l>
     <l>From Ongentheow took his burnie of iron,</l>
     <l>His hard hilted sword and his helmet besides,</l>
     <l>The hoary one's armor to Hygelac bore.</l>
     <l>The armor he took and to them fairly promised</l>
     <l n="2990">Gifts to his people, and kept his word too.</l>
     <l>The lord of the Geats paid for the contest,</l>
     <l>The son of Hrethel, when he came to his home,</l>
     <l>To Eofor and Wulf with very rich jewels,</l>

     <l>Any man on mid-earth, since they heroic deeds wrought),</l>
     <l>And then to Eofor gave his sole daughter,</l>
     <l>The home-adornment, as a pledge of his favor.</l>
     <l>That is the feud and that the enmity,</l>
     <l n="3000">Hate deadly of men, wherefore I expect</l>
     <l>That the Swedes' people against us will seek,</l>

     <l>And now at the last with his own life</l>
     <l>Rings has he bought: these fire shall devour,</l>
     <l n="3015">The flame consume; no earl shall wear</l>
     <l>A jewel in memory, nor the beautiful maid</l>
     <l>Have on her neck a ring-adornment,</l>
     <l>But she shall sad in mind, robbed of her gold,</l>
     <l>Often not once tread a strange land.</l>
     <l n="3020">Now that the war-chief laughter has left,</l>
     <l>Mirth and enjoyment. For this shall the spear be,</l>
     <l>Many a one morning-cold, clasped with the fingers,</l>

     <l>Long as he lay; the air he enjoyed</l>
     <l>Sometimes at night, down again went</l>
     <pb n="93"/>
     <l n="3045">To visit his den: he was then fast in death,</l>
     <l>He had enjoyed the last of earth-caves.</l>
     <l>By him there stood pitchers and cups,</l>
     <l>Plates too lay there and precious swords,</l>
     <l>Rusty and eaten-through, as in the earth's bosom</l>
     <l n="3050">A thousand of winters there they had remained,</l>
     <l>Since that bequest exceedingly great,</l>
     <l>The gold of the ancients, was bewitched with a spell,</l>
     <l>So that the ringed hall might one not touch,</l>
     <l>Any of men, unless God himself,</l>
     <l n="3055">True King of victories, to whom He would granted</l>
     <l>To open the hoard, the charge of enchanters,</l>
     <l>Even so to such man, as seemed to Him right.</l>

     <l>Then was it seen that the way did not prosper</l>
     <l>To him who with wrong had hid within</l>
     <l n="3060">The hoard 'neath the wall. The keeper ere slew</l>
     <l>Some one of his foes: then was the feud</l>
     <l>With battle avenged. Is it a wonder</l>
     <l>When a warlike earl the end approaches</l>
     <l>Of his life-fate, when may no longer</l>
     <l n="3065">A man with his kinsmen a mead-hall in-dwell?</l>
     <l>So was it to Beowulf, when he the mount's keeper,</l>
     <l>The contest sought: he himself knew not</l>
     <l>How his world-severing was to take place;</l>
     <l>How it against doom's-day deeply had cursed</l>
     <l n="3070">The mighty princes who that put there,</l>
     <l>That that man should be guilty of sins,</l>
     <l>Shut up in cursed places, fast in hell-bonds,</l>
     <l>Punished with plagues, who should that plain tread</l>
     <l>He was not gold-greedy; he rather would have</l>
     <l n="3075">The owner's favor sooner looked on.-</l>
     <l>Wiglaf then spoke, Weohstan's son:</l>
     <l>"Oft many an earl for the sake of one</l>
     <l>Sorrow shall suffer, as is happened to us.</l>
     <l>We might not give to our dear prince,</l>
     <pb n="94"/>
     <l n="3080">The kingdom's ruler, any advice,</l>
     <l>So that he might not that gold-keeper meet,</l>
     <l>Might let him remain where he long was,</l>
     <l>Dwell in his haunts until the world's end,</l>
     <l>Fulfil his high fate. The hoard is looked on,</l>
     <l n="3085">Bitterly gotten: that fate was too mighty</l>
     <l>Which that folk-king thither enticed.</l>
     <l>I was therein and looked through it all,</l>
     <l>The treasures of hall, when 'twas allowed me,</l>
     <l>Not at all friendly a journey permitted</l>
     <l n="3090">In 'neath the earth-wall. In haste I took</l>
     <l>A great mighty burden with my own hands</l>
     <l>Of the hoard-treasures, bore them out hither</l>
     <l>To mine own king: he was then still alive,</l>
     <l>Wise and still conscious: very much spoke</l>
     <l n="3095">The ag√©d in sorrow and ordered to greet you,</l>
     <l>Bade that ye should, for your friend's deeds, make</l>
     <l>On the place of the pyre the lofty mound,</l>
     <l>Mickle and mighty, as he of men was</l>
     <l>The most worthy warrior through the wide earth,</l>
     <l n="3100">While he city-treasures still could enjoy.</l>
     <l>Let us now hasten a second time</l>
     <l>To see and to seek that heap of treasures,</l>
     <l>Wonder 'neath wall. I shall direct you,</l>
     <l>That ye may once more see now enough</l>
     <l n="3105">Of rings and broad gold. Be the bier ready,</l>
     <l>Quickly prepared, when we come out,</l>
     <l>And then let us bear our own dear lord,</l>
     <l>The man beloved, where he shall long</l>
     <l>In the Almighty's keeping patiently wait."</l>
     <l n="3110">Bade he then order, Weohstan's son,</l>
     <l>The warrior brave, to many of men,</l>
     <l>Of dwellers in houses, that they the fire-wood</l>
     <l>Should bear from afar, the lords of the people,</l>
     <l>To where lay the good one: "Now shall fire eat</l>
     <pb n="95"/>
     <l n="3115">(The wan flame shall grow) the chief of warriors,</l>
     <l>Him who oft awaited the iron-shower,</l>
     <l>When the storm of arrows, loosed from the strings,</l>
     <l>Leaped over the shield-wall, the shaft did its duty,</l>
     <l>Fitted with feathers followed the barb."</l>
     <l n="3120">Now then the wise son of Weohstan</l>
     <l>Called from the crowd of the kings thanes</l>
     <l>Seven together, the choicest ones,</l>
     <l>Went one of eight 'neath the hostile roof;</l>
     <l>One warrior brave in his hands bore</l>
     <l n="3125">A lighted torch, who went in front.</l>
     <l>It was not then allotted who should plunder that hoard,</l>
     <l>After unguarded any portion of it</l>
     <l>The warriors saw remain in the hall,</l>
     <l>Lie wasting away: little one sorrowed,</l>
     <l n="3130">That they hastily carried without</l>
     <l>The precious treasures. The dragon they shoved,</l>
     <l>The worm, o'er the wall-cliff, let the waves take,</l>
     <l>The flood embrace, the keeper of jewels.</l>
     <l>There was twisted gold on a wain laden,</l>
     <l n="3135">Of each countless heap: the prince was borne,</l>
     <l>The hoary warrior, to the Whale's ness.</l>
    </div>
    <div type="textpart" subtype="card" n="3137">
     <head>XLIII</head>
     <l>For him then prepared the folk of the Geats</l>
     <l>A funeral-pyre on the earth firm,</l>
     <l>Hung with helmets, with shields of war,</l>
     <l n="3140">With burnies bright, as he had begged.</l>
     <l>Laid they then in the midst the mighty prince,</l>
     <l>The mourning warriors their lord beloved.</l>
     <l>'Gan they then on the mountain the greatest of pyres</l>
     <l>The warriors to kindle: the wood-smoke arose</l>
     <l n="3145">From the burning pile black, the crackling flame</l>
     <l>Mingled with mourning (the wind-roar was still),</l>
     <l>Until it had broken the house of bone,</l>
     <l>Hot in the breast. Sad in their minds</l>
     <pb n="96"/>
     <l>With sorrow they mourned their dear lord's death;</l>
     <l n="3150">Also a sad song uttered the spouse,</l>
     <l>Pained in her breast, grieved in her heart,</l>
     <l>Mournful she frequently fettered her mind,</l>
     <l>So that for her husband's most grievous blows</l>
     <l>She wept, the grim fate of his bloody death,</l>
     <l n="3155">. . . . . terror of fire</l>
     <l>heaven swallowed the smoke.</l>
     <l>Wrought they there then the folk of the Weders</l>
     <l>A mound on the steep, which high was and broad,</l>
     <l>For the sea-goers to see from afar,</l>
     <l n="3160">And they built up within ten days,</l>
     <l>The warlike one's beacon; the brightest of flames</l>
     <l>They girt with a wall, as it most worthily</l>
     <l>Very wise men might there devise.</l>
     <l>They in the mound placed rings and bright jewels</l>
     <l n="3165">All such precious things as before in the hoard</l>
     <l>Brave-minded men had taken away.</l>
     <l>They let the earth hold the treasure of earls,</l>
     <l>Gold in the ground, where it still lives</l>
     <l>As useless to men as it before was.</l>
     <l n="3170">Then 'round the mound the battle-brave rode,</l>
     <l>Children of nobles (they were twelve in all),</l>
     <l>Their sorrow would tell, grieve for their king,</l>
     <l>Their mourning utter, and about the man speak;</l>
     <l>His earlship they praised, and his noble deeds</l>
     <l n="3175">They extolled to the courtiers, as it is right</l>
     <l>That one his dear lord in word should praise,</l>
     <l>With soul him love, when he shall forth</l>
     <l>From his own body be severed by death.</l>
     <l>So then lamented the folk of the Geats</l>
     <l n="3180">The fall of their lord, the hearth-companions,</l>
     <l>Said that he was a mighty king,</l>
     <l>Mildest to men and most tender-hearted,</l>
     <l>To his folk most kind and fondest of praise.</l>
