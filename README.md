PerseusDL canonical repository
=========

This was the first public GitHub repository home for the TEI XML texts of the Perseus Digital Library.

As our strategy for working with the texts through GitHub has evolved and as the repository has been growing, 
we have decided to move the texts to individual repositories subdived by the CTS namespace to which the texts 
have been assigned.  In general, namespace corresponds to language of original transmission for the work.

Greek works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit)

Latin works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-latinLit)

Anglo-Saxon works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-angLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-angLit)

Italian works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-itaLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-itaLit)

Norse works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-norseLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-norseLit)

Farsi works are now in [http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-farsiLit](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-farsiLit)

We are still working through our strategy for secondary sources and reference works. For now you can find them in 
[http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-pdlrefwk](http://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-pdlrefwk) but this is subject to change.

If you are unsure of where to find a work you are interested in, please use the [Perseus Catalog](http://catalog.perseus.org).  The Catalog interface prominently displays the CTS URN for each edition or translation of a work.  The filestructure in our GitHub repositories for texts currently adhere to the following structure:

`canonical-NAMESPACE/data/TEXTGROUP/WORK/TEXTGROUP-WORK-VERSION.xml`

More information on the CTS identifier structure of the Perseus texts can be found in the [Catalog documentation](http://sites.tufts.edu/perseuscatalog/f-a-q/how-are-the-record-identifiers-created/).

Note that all GitHub file locations are subject to change, and that URLS to the GitHub files should NOT be used as Permanent Stable Identifiers for the Perseus texts.  Information on where and how to find stable identifiers for the Perseus texts is provided at

[http://sites.tufts.edu/perseusupdates/beta-features/perseus-stable-uris/](http://sites.tufts.edu/perseusupdates/beta-features/perseus-stable-uris/)
